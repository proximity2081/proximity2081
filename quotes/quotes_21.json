remotely similar."}, {"time": 475, "text": "So in that sense, it's internal."}, {"time": 478, "text": "Now there is a long tradition, which I think is valid going back centuries to the early

you've talked about it defining essentially our capacity, our limit and our scope."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Can you try to define what limit and scope are?"}, {"time": 598, "text": "And the bigger question, do you think it's possible to find the limit of human cognition?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "It's commonly believed, most scientists believe that human intelligence can answer any question in principle."}, {"time": 619, "text": "I think that's a very strange belief."}, {"time": 621, "text": "If we're biological organisms, which are not angels, then our capacities ought to have scope and limits which are interrelated."}, {"time": 634, "text": "Can you define those two terms?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "Well, let's take a concrete example."}, {"time": 640, "text": "Your genetic endowment determines that you can have a male in visual system, arms and legs and so on, but it therefore become a rich, complex organism."}, {"time": 653, "text": "But if you look at that same genetic endowment, it prevents you from developing in other directions."}, {"time": 659, "text": "There's no kind of experience which would yield the embryo to develop an insect visual system or to develop wings instead of arms."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So the very endowment that confers richness and complexity also sets bounds on what can be attained."}, {"time": 683, "text": "Now, I assume that our cognitive capacities are part of the organic world."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Therefore, they should have the same properties."}, {"time": 692, "text": "If they had no built in capacity to develop a rich and complex structure, we would understand nothing."}, {"time": 701, "text": "Just as if your genetic endowment did not compel you to develop arms and legs, you would just be some kind of random amoeboid creature with no structure at all."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So I think it's plausible to assume that there are limits and I think we even have some evidence as to what they are."}, {"time": 723, "text": "So for example, there's a classic moment in the history of science at the time of Newton."}, {"time": 731, "text": "There was a from Galileo to Newton modern science developed on a fundamental assumption which Newton also accepted."}, {"time": 740, "text": "Namely that the world is an entire universe is a mechanical object."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And by mechanical, they meant something like the kinds of artifacts that were being developed by skilled artisans all over Europe, the gears, levers and so on."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And their belief was well, the world is just a more complex variant of this."}, {"time": 762, "text": "Newton, to his astonishment and distress, proved that there are no machines, that there's interaction without contact."}, {"time": 774, "text": "His contemporaries like Leibniz and Huygens just dismissed this as returning to the mysticism of the neo scholastics."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And Newton agreed."}, {"time": 785, "text": "He said it is totally absurd."}, {"time": 788, "text": "No person of any scientific intelligence could ever accept this for a moment."}, {"time": 793, "text": "In fact, he spent the rest of his life trying to get around it somehow, as did many other scientists."}, {"time": 800, "text": "That was the very criterion of intelligibility for say Galileo or Newton."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Theory did not produce an intelligible world unless you could duplicate it in a machine."}, {"time": 814, "text": "He showed you can't, there are no machines, any."}, {"time": 817, "text": "Finally, after a long struggle, took a long time, scientists just accepted this as common sense."}, {"time": 825, "text": "But that's a significant moment."}, {"time": 827, "text": "That means they abandoned the search for an intelligible world."}, {"time": 831, "text": "And the great philosophers of the time understood that very well."}, {"time": 837, "text": "So for example, David Hume in his encomium to Newton wrote that who was the greatest thinker ever and so on."}, {"time": 845, "text": "He said that he unveiled many of the secrets of nature, but by showing the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy, mechanical science, he left us with, he showed that there are mysteries which ever will remain."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And science just changed its goals."}, {"time": 866, "text": "It abandoned the mysteries."}, {"time": 868, "text": "It can't solve it, we'll put it aside."}, {"time": 871, "text": "We only look for intelligible theories."}, {"time": 874, "text": "Newton's theories were intelligible."}, {"time": 876, "text": "It's just what they described wasn't."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Well, Locke said the same thing."}, {"time": 882, "text": "I think they're basically right."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And if so, that showed something about the limits of human cognition."}, {"time": 889, "text": "We cannot attain the goal of understanding the world, of finding an intelligible world."}, {"time": 898, "text": "This mechanical philosophy Galileo to Newton, there's a good case that can be made that that's our instinctive conception of how things work."}, {"time": 910, "text": "So if say infants are tested with things that, if this moves and then this moves, they kind of invent something that must be invisible that's in between them that's making them move and so on."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Yeah, we like physical contact."}, {"time": 926, "text": "Something about our brain seeks."}, {"time": 928, "text": "Makes us want a world like that."}, {"time": 931, "text": "Just like it wants a world that has regular geometric figures."}, {"time": 936, "text": "So for example, Descartes pointed this out that if you have an infant who's never seen a triangle before and you draw a triangle, the infant will see a distorted triangle, not whatever crazy figure it actually is."}, {"time": 956, "text": "Three lines not coming quite together, one of them a little bit curved and so on."}, {"time": 960, "text": "We just impose a conception of the world in terms of geometric, perfect geometric objects."}, {"time": 969, "text": "It's now been shown that goes way beyond that."}, {"time": 972, "text": "That if you show on a tachistoscope, let's say a couple of lights shining, you do it three or four times in a row."}, {"time": 980, "text": "What people actually see is a rigid object in motion, not whatever's there."}, {"time": 986, "text": "We all know that from a television set basically."}, {"time": 991, "text": "So that gives us hints of potential limits to our cognition."}, {"time": 995, "text": "I think it does, but it's a very contested view."}, {"time": 999, "text": "If you do a poll among scientists, it's impossible we can understand anything."},

brain machine, brain computer interface."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "So they try to do thousands readings in the brain, be able to read what the neurons are firing and then stimulate back, so two way."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Do you think their dream is to expand the capacity of the brain to attain information, sort of increase the bandwidth of which we can search Google kind of thing?"},

this could expand it too."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "But it's not a fundamental expansion."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "It's not totally new things could be understood."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Well, nothing that goes beyond their native cognitive capacities."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "Just like you can't turn the visual system into an insect system."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Well, I mean, the thought is, the thought is perhaps you can't directly, but you can map sort of."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "You couldn't, but we already, we know that without this experiment."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "You could map what a bee sees and present it in a form so that we could follow it."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "In fact, every bee scientist does that."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "But you don't think there's something greater than bees that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something, be able to understand a quantum world, quantum mechanics, be able to start to be able to make sense."},

the theories, but the world that it describes doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "So, you know, the experiment, Schrodinger's cat, for example, can understand the theory, but as Schrodinger pointed out, it's an unintelligible world."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "One of the reasons why Einstein was always very skeptical about quantum theory, was that he described himself as a classical realist, in one's intelligibility."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "He has something in common with infants in that way."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "So, back to linguistics."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "If you could humor me, what are the most beautiful or fascinating aspects of language or ideas in linguistics or cognitive science that you've seen in a lifetime of studying language and studying the human mind?"}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Well, I think the deepest property of language and puzzling property that's been discovered is what is sometimes called structure dependence."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "We now understand it pretty well, but it was puzzling for a long time."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I'll give you a concrete example."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "So, suppose you say the guy who fixed the car carefully packed his tools, it's ambiguous."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "He could fix the car carefully or carefully pack his tools."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Suppose you put carefully in front, carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools, then it's carefully packed, not carefully fixed."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "And in fact, you do that even if it makes no sense."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "So, suppose you say carefully, the guy who fixed the car is tall."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "You have to interpret it as carefully he's tall, even though that doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And notice that that's a very puzzling fact because you're relating carefully not to the linearly closest verb, but to the linearly more remote verb."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "A linear closeness is an easy computation, but here you're doing a much more, what looks like a more complex computation."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "You're doing something that's taking you essentially to the more remote thing."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "It's now, if you look at the actual structure of the sentence, where the phrases are and so on, turns out you're picking out the structurally closest thing, but the linearly more remote thing."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "But notice that what's linear is 100% of what you hear."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "You never hear structure, can't."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "So, what you're doing is, and certainly this is universal, all constructions, all languages, and what we're compelled to do is carry out what looks like the more complex computation on material that we never hear, and we ignore 100% of what we hear and the simplest computation."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "By now, there's even a neural basis for this that's somewhat understood, and there's good theories by now that explain why it's true."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "That's a deep insight into the surprising nature of language with many consequences."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Let me ask you about a field of machine learning, deep learning."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "There's been a lot of progress in neural networks based, neural network based machine learning in the recent decade."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "Of course, neural network research goes back many decades."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "What do you think are the limits of deep learning, of neural network based machine learning?"}, {"time": 1358, "text": "Well, to give a real answer to that, you'd have to understand the exact processes that are taking place, and those are pretty opaque."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So, it's pretty hard to prove a theorem about what can be done and what can't be done, but I think it's reasonably clear."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I mean, putting technicalities aside, what deep learning is doing is taking huge numbers of examples and finding some patterns."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Okay, that could be interesting in some areas it is, but we have to ask here a certain question."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "Is it engineering or is it science?"}, {"time": 1398, "text": "Engineering in the sense of just trying to build something that's useful, or science in the sense that it's trying to understand something about elements of the world."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "So, take, say, a Google parser."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "We can ask that question."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Is it useful, yeah, it's pretty useful."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "I use a Google translator, so on engineering grounds, it's kind of worth having, like a bulldozer."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Does it tell you anything about human language?"}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Zero, nothing, and in fact, it's very striking."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "From the very beginning, it's just totally remote from science."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So, what is a Google parser doing?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "It's taking an enormous text, let's say the Wall Street Journal corpus, and asking how close can we come to getting the right description of every sentence in the corpus."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Well, every sentence in the corpus is essentially an experiment."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Each sentence that you produce is an experiment which says, am I a grammatical sentence?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "The answer is usually yes."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "So, most of the stuff in the corpus is grammatical sentences."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "But now, ask yourself, is there any science which takes random experiments which are carried out for no reason whatsoever and tries to find out something from them?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "Like if you're, say, a chemistry PhD student, you wanna get a thesis, can you say, well, I'm just gonna mix a lot of things together, no purpose, and maybe I'll find something."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "You'd be laughed out of the department."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Science tries to find critical experiments, ones that answer some theoretical question."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "Doesn't care about coverage of millions of experiments."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "So, it just begins by being very remote from science and it continues like that."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So, the usual question that's asked about, say, a Google parser is how well does it do, or some parser, how well does it do on a corpus?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "But there's another question that's never asked."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "How well does it do on something that violates all the rules of language?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So, for example, take the structure dependence case that I mentioned."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Suppose there was a language in which you used linear proximity as the mode of interpretation."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "These deep learning would work very easily on that."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "In fact, much more easily on an actual language."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Is that a success?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "No, that's a failure from a scientific point of view."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "It's a failure."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "It shows that we're not discovering the nature of the system at all, because it does just as well or even better on things that violate the structure of the system."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And it goes on from there."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "It's not an argument against doing it."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "It is useful to have devices like this."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "So, yes, so neural networks are kind of approximators that look, there's echoes of the behavioral debates, right?"}, {"time": 1584, "text": "Behavioralism."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "More than echoes."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Many of the people in deep learning say they've vindicated Terry Sanyosky, for example, in his recent books, as this vindicates Skinnerian behaviors."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "It doesn't have anything to do with it."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "Yes, but I think there's something actually fundamentally different when the data set is huge."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "But your point is extremely well taken."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "But do you think we can learn, approximate that interesting complex structure of language with neural networks that will somehow help us understand the science?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "I mean, you find patterns that you hadn't noticed, let's say, could be."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "In fact, it's very much like a kind of linguistics that's done, what's called corpus linguistics."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "When you, suppose you have some language where all the speakers have died out, but you have records."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "So you just look at the records and see what you can figure out from that."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "It's much better than, it's much better to have actual speakers where you can do critical experiments."}, {"time": 1656,

ago."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So you're kind of forced just to take what data's around and see what you can figure out from it."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "Okay, it's a serious study."}, {"time":

anyone that had an interest in machine learning to break into the field."}, {"time": 485, "text": "And I think sometimes I've actually had people ask me, hey, why are you spending so much time explaining gradient descent?"}, {"time": 491, "text": "And my answer was, if I look at what I think the learner needs and what benefit from, I felt that having that a good understanding of the foundations coming back to the basics would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career."}, {"time": 506, "text": "So try to consistently make decisions on that principle."}, {"time": 510, "text": "So one of the things you actually revealed to the narrow AI community at the time and to the world is that the amount of people who are actually interested in AI is much larger than we imagined."}, {"time": 523, "text": "By you teaching the class and how popular it became, it showed that, wow, this isn't just a small community of sort of people who go to NeurIPS and it's much bigger."}, {"time": 536, "text": "It's developers, it's people from all over the world."}, {"time": 539, "text": "I mean, I'm Russian, so everybody in Russia is really interested."}, {"time":

interested in machine learning."}, {"time": 553, "text": "So how big do you get a sense that the number of people is that are interested from your perspective?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "I think the number has grown over time."}, {"time": 562, "text": "I think it's one of those things that maybe it feels like it came out of nowhere, but it's an insight that building it, it took years."}, {"time": 568, "text": "It's one of those overnight successes that took years to get there."}, {"time": 573, "text": "My first foray into this type of online education was when we were filming my Stanford class

{"time": 587, "text": "And then we had four or five other versions of websites that I had built, most of which you would never have heard of because they reached small audiences, but that allowed me to iterate, allowed my team and me to iterate, to learn what are the ideas that work and what doesn't."}, {"time": 602, "text": "For example, one of the features I was really excited about and really proud of was build this website where multiple people could be logged into the website at the same time."}, {"time": 611, "text": "So today, if you go to a website, if you are logged in and then I want to log in, you need to log out because it's the same browser, the same computer."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But I thought, well, what if two people say you and me were watching a video together in front of a computer?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "What if a website could have you type your name and password, have me type my name and password, and then now the computer knows both of us are watching together and it gives both of us credit for anything we do as a group."}, {"time": 635, "text": "Influencers feature rolled it out in a high school in San Francisco."}, {"time": 639, "text": "We had about 20 something users."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Where's the teacher there?"}, {"time": 643, "text": "Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep, the teacher is great."}, {"time": 646, "text": "I mean, guess what?"}, {"time": 647, "text": "Zero people use this feature."}, {"time": 649, "text": "It turns out people studying online, they want to watch the videos by themselves."}, {"time": 653, "text": "So you can play back, pause at your own speed rather than in groups."}, {"time": 657, "text": "So that was one example of a tiny lesson learned out of many that allowed us to hone into the set of features."}, {"time": 664, "text": "It sounds like a brilliant feature."}, {"time": 666, "text": "So I guess the lesson to take from that is there's something that looks amazing on paper and then nobody uses it."}, {"time": 675, "text": "It doesn't actually have the impact that you think it might have."}, {"time": 678, "text": "And so, yeah, I saw that you really went through a lot of different features and a lot of ideas to arrive at Coursera, the final kind of powerful thing that showed the world that MOOCs can educate millions."}, {"time": 692, "text": "And I think with the whole machine learning movement as well, I think it didn't come out of nowhere."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Instead, what happened was as more people learn about machine learning, they will tell their friends and their friends will see how it's applicable to their work."}, {"time": 705, "text": "And then the community kept on growing."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And I think we're still growing."},

core machine learning model maybe is even bigger."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I feel like today almost every software engineer has some understanding of the cloud."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Not all, but maybe this is my microcontroller developer that doesn't need to deal with the cloud."}, {"time": 744, "text": "But I feel like the vast majority of software engineers today are sort of having an appreciation of the cloud."}, {"time": 751, "text": "I think in the future, maybe we'll approach nearly 100% of all developers being in some way an AI developer or at least having an appreciation of machine learning."}, {"time": 761, "text": "And my hope is that there's this kind of effect that there's people who are not really interested in being a programmer or being into software engineering, like biologists, chemists, and physicists, even mechanical engineers, all these disciplines that are now more and more sitting on large data sets."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And here they didn't think they're interested in programming until they have this data set and they realize there's this set of machine learning tools that allow you to use the data set."}, {"time": 789, "text": "So they actually become, they learn to program and they become new programmers."}, {"time": 793, "text": "So like the, not just because you've mentioned a larger percentage of developers become machine learning people."}, {"time": 799, "text": "So it seems like more and more the kinds of people who are becoming developers is also growing significantly."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Yeah, I think once upon a time, only a small part of humanity was literate, could read and write."}, {"time": 814, "text": "And maybe you thought, maybe not everyone needs to learn to read and write."}, {"time": 817, "text": "You just go listen to a few monks read to you and maybe that was enough."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Or maybe you just need a few handful of authors to write the bestsellers and no one else needs to write."}, {"time": 830, "text": "But what we found was that by giving as many people, in some countries, almost everyone, basic literacy, it dramatically enhanced human to human communications."}, {"time": 839, "text": "And we can now write for an audience of one, such as if I send you an email or you send me an email."}, {"time": 844, "text": "I think in computing, we're still in that phase where so few people know how to code that the coders mostly have to code for relatively large audiences."}, {"time": 854, "text": "But if everyone, or most people became developers at some level, similar to how most people in developed economies are somewhat literate, I would love to see the owners of a mom and pop store be able to write a little bit of code to customize the TV display for their special this week."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And I think it will enhance human to computer communications, which is becoming more and more important today as well."}, {"time": 878, "text": "So you think it's possible that machine learning becomes kind of similar to literacy, where like you said, the owners of a mom and pop shop, is basically everybody in all walks of life would have some degree of programming capability?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "I could see society getting there."}, {"time": 898, "text": "There's one other interesting thing."}, {"time": 900, "text": "If I go talk to the mom and pop store, if I talk to a lot of people in their daily professions, I previously didn't have a good story for why they should learn to code."}, {"time": 909, "text": "We could give them some reasons."}, {"time": 911, "text": "But what I found with the rise of machine learning and data science is that I think the number of people with a concrete use for data science in their daily lives, in their jobs, may be even larger than the number of people who have concrete use for software engineering."}, {"time": 925, "text": "For example, if you run a small mom and pop store, I think if you can analyze the data about your sales, your customers, I think there's actually real value there, maybe even more than traditional software engineering."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So I find that for a lot of my friends in various professions, be it recruiters or accountants or people that work in the factories, which I deal with more and more these days, I feel if they were data scientists at some level, they could immediately use that in their work."}, {"time": 954, "text": "So I think that data science and machine learning may be an even easier entree into the developer world for a lot of people than the software engineering."}, {"time": 964, "text": "And I agree with that, but that's beautifully put."}, {"time": 966, "text": "But we live in a world where most courses and talks have slides, PowerPoint, keynote, and yet you famously often still use a marker and a whiteboard."}, {"time": 977, "text": "The simplicity of that is compelling, and for me at least, fun to watch."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So let me ask, why do you like using a marker and whiteboard, even on the biggest of stages?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "I think it depends on the concepts you want to explain."}, {"time": 992, "text": "For mathematical concepts, it's nice to build up the equation one piece at a time, and the whiteboard marker or the pen and stylus is a very easy way to build up the equation, to build up a complex concept one piece at a time while you're talking about it, and sometimes that enhances understandability."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "The downside of writing is that it's slow, and so if you want a long sentence, it's very hard to write that."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So I think there are pros and cons, and sometimes I use slides, and sometimes I use a whiteboard or a stylus."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "The slowness of a whiteboard is also its upside, because it forces you to reduce everything to the basics."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Some of your talks involve the whiteboard."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "I mean, you go very slowly, and you really focus on the most simple principles, and that's a beautiful, that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas that I think is surprising at least for me is great for education."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Like a great talk, I think, is not one that has a lot of content."}, {"time": 1056,

life, and do you have any favorite memories of working with Peter, since you were your first student in those uncertain times, especially before deep learning really sort of blew up?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Any favorite memories from those times?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Yeah, I was really fortunate to have had Peter Abbeel as my first PhD student, and I think even my long term professional

hardest problems we had was when the helicopter's flying around upside down, doing stunts, how do you figure out the position?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "How do you localize the helicopter?"},

see the satellites."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So we experimented trying to have two GPS units, one facing up, one facing down."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So if you flip over, that didn't work because the downward facing one couldn't synchronize if you're flipping quickly."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Morgan Quigley was exploring this crazy, complicated configuration of specialized hardware to interpret GPS signals."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Looking at the FPG is completely insane."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Spent about a year working on that, didn't work."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So I remember Peter, great guy, him and me, sitting down in my office looking at some of the latest things we had tried that didn't work and saying, done it, what now?"}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Because we tried so many things and it just didn't work."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "In the end, what we did, and Adam Coles was crucial to this, was put cameras on the ground and use cameras on the ground to localize the helicopter."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "And that solved the localization problem so that we could then focus on the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques so it didn't actually make the helicopter fly."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I'm reminded, when I was doing this work at Stanford, around that time, there was a lot of reinforcement learning theoretical papers, but not a lot of practical applications."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So the autonomous helicopter work for flying helicopters was one of the few practical applications of reinforcement learning at the time, which caused it to become pretty well known."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I feel like we might have almost come full circle with today."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "There's so much buzz, so

that the work I do will influence people, have positive impact, or help someone."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I remember when many years ago, I was speaking with a mathematics professor, and it kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do?"}, {"time": 1338, "text": "It kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do?"}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And then he said, he had stars in his eyes when

what that's called, 2000s, the aughts?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Yeah, I can tell you the thing we got wrong and the thing we got right."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "The thing we really got wrong was the importance of, the early importance of unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So early days of Google Brain, we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And there was this argument, I think it was around 2005 after NeurIPS, at that time called NIPS, but now NeurIPS had ended."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And Jeff

trillion."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "So there's 10 to the 14 synaptic connections."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "You will live for about 10 to the nine seconds."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "That's 30 years."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "You actually live for two by 10 to the nine, maybe three by 10 to the nine seconds."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So just let's say 10 to the nine."}, {"time": 1466,

10 to the five bits per second you need to learn in your life."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And I have a one year old daughter."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "I am not pointing out 10 to five bits per second of labels to her."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And I think I'm a very loving parent, but I'm just not gonna do that."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "So from this very crude, definitely problematic argument, there's just no way that most of what we know is through supervised learning."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "But where you get so many bits of information is from sucking in images, audio, those experiences in the world."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And so that argument, and there are a lot of known forces argument you should go into, really convinced me that there's a lot of power to unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "So that was the part that we actually maybe got wrong."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I still think unsupervised learning is really important, but in the early days, 10, 15 years ago, a lot of us thought that was the path forward."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Oh, so you're saying that that perhaps was the wrong intuition for the time."}, {"time": 1545,

person, fortunate to have worked with him, he was in my group at Stanford at the time and Adam had run these experiments at Stanford showing that the bigger we train a learning algorithm, the better its performance."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And it was based on that."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "There was a graph that Adam generated where the X axis, Y axis lines going up into the right."},

that he gave me the conviction that you could scale these models way bigger than what we could on a few CPUs, which is where we had at Stanford that we could get even better results."}, {"time": 1591,

very carefully selecting the data set, but growing the scale of the data set is going to lead to even further breakthroughs in deep learning."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And there's currently pushback at that idea that larger data sets are no longer, so you want to increase the efficiency of learning."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "You want to make better learning mechanisms."}, {"time": 1693, "text":

on this dual side?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Do we need to come up with better architectures for learning or can we just get bigger, better data sets that will improve performance?"}, {"time": 1717,

level performance and then there's that theoretical ceiling that we will never surpass, so Bayes error rate."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "But then I think there are plenty of problems where we're still quite far from either human level performance or from Bayes error rate and bigger data sets with neural networks without further algorithmic innovation will be sufficient to take us further."},

to do with it."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "If we look at what happened with GP2 and BERTZ, I think scale was a large part of the story."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Yeah, that's not often talked about is the scale of the data set it was trained on and the quality of the data set because there's some, so it was like reddit threads that had, they were operated highly."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So there's already some weak supervision on a very large data set that people don't often talk about, right?"}, {"time": 1787, "text": "I find that today we have maturing processes to managing code,

or whatever, or use a debugger, trace through the code in traditional software engineering."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "So it's an evolving discipline, but I find that the people that are really good at debugging machine learning algorithms are easily 10x, maybe 100x faster at getting something to work."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "And the basic process of debugging is, so the bug in this case, why

in with neural networks."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Yeah, often the question is, why doesn't it work yet?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "Or can I expect it to eventually work?"}, {"time": 2392, "text":

understandable."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "So when you move on to the more advanced thing, we learn confidence, hopefully you have enough intuitions from the earlier sections to then understand why we

I'm curious, you do a lot of teaching as well."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Do you have a favorite, this is the hard concept moment in your teaching?"}, {"time": 2499, "text": "Well, I don't think anyone's ever turned the interview on me."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "I'm glad you get first."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I think that's a really good question."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "Yeah, it's really hard to capture the moment when they struggle."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "I think you put it really eloquently."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "I do think there's moments that are like aha moments that really inspire people."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "I think for some reason, reinforcement learning, especially deep reinforcement learning is a really great way to really inspire people and get what the use of neural networks can do."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "Even though neural networks really are just a part of the deep RL framework, but it's a really nice way to paint the entirety of the

the games, the scope."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "Actually, at NeurIPS, a bunch of us were standing around saying, hey, what's your best example of an actual deploy reinforcement learning

to say, but some days we use a neural net, some days we use a PCA."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "Actually, the other day, I was sitting down with my team looking at PCA residuals, trying to figure out what's going on with PCA applied to manufacturing problem."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And some days we use a probabilistic graphical model, some days we use a knowledge draft, which is one of the things that has tremendous industry impact."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "But the amount of chatter about knowledge drafts in academia is really thin compared to the actual real world impact."}, {"time":

that achieves world class, not necessarily beats the world champion, but achieves that kind of level of playing Go?"}, {"time": 744, "text": "First of all, thank you, that's very kind words."}, {"time": 747, "text": "And funnily enough, I just came from a panel where I was actually in a conversation with Garry Kasparov and Murray Campbell, who was the author of Deep Blue."}, {"time": 758, "text": "And it was their first meeting together since the match."}, {"time": 763, "text": "So that just occurred yesterday."}, {"time": 764, "text": "So I'm literally fresh from that experience."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So these are amazing moments when they happen, but where did it all start?"}, {"time": 772, "text": "Well, for me, it started when I became fascinated in the game of Go."}, {"time": 776, "text": "So Go for me, I've grown up playing games."}, {"time": 779, "text": "I've always had a fascination in board games."}, {"time": 781, "text": "I played chess as a kid, I played Scrabble as a kid."}, {"time": 786, "text": "When I was at university, I discovered the game of Go."}, {"time": 788, "text": "And to me, it just blew all of those other games out of the water."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It was just so deep and profound in its complexity with endless levels to it."}, {"time": 797, "text": "What I discovered was that I could devote endless hours to this game."}, {"time": 805, "text": "And I knew in my heart of hearts that no matter how many hours I would devote to it, I would never become a grandmaster, or there was another path."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And the other path was to try and understand how you could get some other intelligence to play this game better than I would be able to."}, {"time": 823, "text": "And so even in those days, I had this idea that, what if, what if it was possible to build a program that could crack this?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "And as I started to explore the domain, I discovered that this was really the domain where people felt deeply that if progress could be made in Go, it would really mean a giant leap forward for AI."}, {"time": 846, "text": "It was the challenge where all other approaches had failed."}, {"time": 850, "text": "This is coming out of the era you mentioned, which was in some sense, the golden era for the classical methods of AI, like heuristic search."}, {"time": 859, "text": "In the 90s, they all fell one after another, not just chess with deep blue, but checkers, backgammon, Othello."}, {"time": 868, "text": "There were numerous cases where systems built on top of heuristic search methods with these high performance systems had been able to defeat the human world champion in each of those domains."}, {"time": 881, "text": "And yet in that same time period, there was a million dollar prize available for the game of Go, for the first system to be a human professional player."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And at the end of that time period, in year 2000 when the prize expired, the strongest Go program in the world was defeated by a nine year old child when that nine year old child was giving nine free moves to the computer at the start of the game to try and even things up."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And computer Go expert beat that same strongest program with 29 handicapped stones, 29 free moves."}, {"time": 918, "text": "So that's what the state of affairs was when I became interested in this problem in around 2003 when I started working on computer Go."}, {"time": 929, "text": "There was nothing, there was very, very little in the way of progress towards meaningful performance, again, anything approaching human level."}, {"time": 939, "text": "And so people, it wasn't through lack of effort, people had tried many, many things."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And so there was a strong sense that something different would be required for Go than had been needed for all of these other domains where AI had been successful."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And maybe the single clearest example is that Go, unlike those other domains, had this kind of intuitive property that a Go player would look at a position and say, hey, here's this mess of black and white stones."}, {"time": 969, "text": "But from this mess, oh, I can predict that this part of the board has become my territory, this part of the board has become your territory, and I've got this overall sense that I'm gonna win and that this is about the right move to play."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And that intuitive sense of judgment, of being able to evaluate what's going on in a position, it was pivotal to humans being able to play this game and something that people had no idea how to put into computers."}, {"time": 995, "text": "So this question of how to evaluate a position, how to come up with these intuitive judgments was the key reason why Go was so hard in addition to its enormous search space, and the reason why methods which had succeeded so well elsewhere failed in Go."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And so people really felt deep down that in order to crack Go we would need to get something akin to human intuition."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And if we got something akin to human intuition, we'd be able to solve many, many more problems in AI."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So for me, that was the moment where it's like, okay, this is not just about playing the game of Go, this is about something profound."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And it was back to that bug which had been itching me all those years."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "This is the opportunity to do something meaningful and transformative, and I guess a dream was born."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So almost this realization that you need to find, formulate Go as a kind of a prediction problem versus a search problem was the intuition."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "I mean, maybe that's the wrong crude term, but to give it the ability to kind of intuit things about positional structure of the board."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Now, okay, but what about the learning part of it?"}, {"time": 1071, "text": "Did you have a sense that you have to, that learning has to be part of the system?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Again, something that hasn't really as far as I think, except with TD Gammon in the 90s with RL a little bit, hasn't been part of those state of the art game playing systems."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So I strongly felt that learning would be necessary."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And that's why my PhD topic back then was trying to apply reinforcement learning to the game of Go and not just learning of any type, but I felt that the only way to really have a system to progress beyond human levels of performance wouldn't just be to mimic how humans do it, but to understand for themselves."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And how else can a machine hope to understand what's going on except through learning?"}, {"time": 1119, "text": "If you're not learning, what else are you doing?"}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Well, you're putting all the knowledge into the system."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And that just feels like something which decades of AI have told us is maybe not a dead end, but certainly has a ceiling to the capabilities."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "It's known as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, that the more you try to put into something, the more brittle the system becomes."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And so you just have to have learning."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "You have to have learning."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "That's the only way you're going to be able to get a system which has sufficient knowledge in it, millions and millions of pieces of knowledge, billions, trillions of a form that it can actually apply for itself and understand how those billions and trillions of pieces of knowledge can be leveraged in a way which will actually lead it towards its goal without conflict or other issues."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Yeah, I mean, if I put myself back in that time, I just wouldn't think like that."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Without a good demonstration of RL, I would think more in the symbolic AI, like not learning, but sort of a simulation of knowledge base, like a growing knowledge base, but it would still be sort of pattern based, like basically have little rules that you kind of assemble together into a large knowledge base."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Well, in a sense, that was the state of the art back then."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "And although not all of the pieces were handcrafted, the overall effect was nevertheless still brittle, and it was hard to make all these pieces work well together."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And so really, what I was pressing for and the main innovation of the approach I took was to go back to first principles and say, well, let's back off that and try and find a principled approach where the system can learn for itself, just from the outcome, like learn for itself."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "If you try something, did that help or did it not help?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "And only through that procedure can you arrive at knowledge, which is verified."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "The system has to verify it for itself, not relying on any other third party to say this is right or this is wrong."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And so that principle was already very important in those days, but unfortunately, we were missing some important pieces back then."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So before we dive into maybe discussing the beauty of reinforcement learning, let's take a step back, we kind of skipped it a bit, but the rules of the game of Go, what the elements of it perhaps contrasting to chess that sort of you really enjoyed as a human being, and also that make it really difficult as a AI machine learning problem."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So the game of Go has remarkably simple rules."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "In fact, so simple that people have speculated that if we were to meet alien life at some point, that we wouldn't be able to communicate with them, but we would be able to play Go with them."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "Probably have discovered the same rule set."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "So the game is played on a 19 by 19 grid, and you play on the intersections of the grid and the players take turns."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And the aim of the game is very simple."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "It's to surround as much territory as you can, as many of these intersections with your stones and to surround more than your opponent does."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "And the only nuance to the game is that if you fully surround your opponent's piece, then you get to capture it and remove it from the board and it counts as your own territory."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Now from those very simple rules, immense complexity arises."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "There's kind of profound strategies in how to surround territory, how to kind of trade off between making solid territory yourself now compared to building up influence that will help you acquire territory later in the game, how to connect groups together, how to keep your own groups alive, which patterns of stones are most useful compared to others."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "There's just immense knowledge."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And human Go players have played this game for, it was discovered thousands of years ago, and human Go players have built up this immense knowledge base over the years."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "It's studied very deeply and played by something like 50 million players across the world, mostly in China, Japan, and Korea, where it's an important part of the culture, so much so that it's considered one of the four ancient arts that was required by Chinese scholars."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So there's a deep history there."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "But there's interesting qualities."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "So if I sort of compare to chess, chess is in the same way as it is in Chinese culture for Go, and chess in Russia is also considered one of the sacred arts."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "So if we contrast sort of Go with chess, there's interesting qualities about Go."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the evaluation of a particular static board is not as reliable."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Like you can't, in chess you can kind of assign points to the different units, and it's kind of a pretty good measure of who's winning, who's losing."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "It's not so clear."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Yeah, so in the game of Go, you find yourself in a situation where both players have played the same number of stones."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Actually, captures at a strong level of play happen very rarely, which means that at any moment in the game, you've got the same number of white stones and black stones."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "And the only thing which differentiates how well you're doing is this intuitive sense of where are the territories ultimately going to form on this board?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "And if you look at the complexity of a real Go position, it's mind boggling that kind of question of what will happen in 300 moves from now when you see just a scattering of 20 white and black stones intermingled."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And so that challenge is the reason why position evaluation is so hard in Go compared to other games."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "In addition to that, it has an enormous search space."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So there's around 10 to the 170 positions in the game of Go."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "That's an astronomical number."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And that search space is so great that traditional heuristic search methods that were so successful in things like Deep Blue and chess programs just kind of fall over in Go."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So at which point did reinforcement learning enter your life, your research life, your way of thinking?"}, {"time": 1543, "text": "We just talked about learning, but reinforcement learning is a very particular kind of learning."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "One that's both philosophically sort of profound, but also one that's pretty difficult to get to work as if we look back in the early days."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So when did that enter your life and how did that work progress?"}, {"time": 1562, "text": "So I had just finished working in the games industry at this startup company."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And I took a year out to discover for myself exactly which path I wanted to take."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "I knew I wanted to study intelligence, but I wasn't sure what that meant at that stage."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I really didn't feel I had the tools to decide on exactly which path I wanted to follow."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So during that year, I read a lot."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "And one of the things I read was Saturn and Barto, the sort of seminal textbook on an introduction to reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And when I read that textbook, I just had this resonating feeling that this is what I understood intelligence to be."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "And this was the path that I felt would be necessary to go down to make progress in AI."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "So I got in touch with Rich Saturn and asked him if he would be interested in supervising me on a PhD thesis in computer go."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And he basically said that if he's still alive, he'd be happy to."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "But unfortunately, he'd been struggling with very serious cancer for some years."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "And he really wasn't confident at that stage that he'd even be around to see the end event."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "But fortunately, that part of the story worked out very happily."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And I found myself out there in Alberta."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "They've got a great games group out there with a history of fantastic work in board games as well, as Rich Saturn, the father of RL."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So it was the natural place for me to go in some sense to study this question."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And the more I looked into it, the more strongly I felt that this wasn't just the path to progress in computer go."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "But really, this was the thing I'd been looking for."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "This was really an opportunity to frame what intelligence means."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Like what are the goals of AI in a clear, single clear problem definition, such that if we're able to solve that clear single problem definition, in some sense, we've cracked the problem of AI."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So to you, reinforcement learning ideas, at least sort of echoes of it, would be at the core of intelligence."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "It is at the core of intelligence."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "And if we ever create a human level intelligence system, it would be at the core of that kind of system."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Let me say it this way, that I think it's helpful to separate out the problem from the solution."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "And so in that sense, I feel that it gives us a path, maybe not the only path, but a path towards AI."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And so do I think that any system in the future that's solved AI would have to have RL within it?"}, {"time": 1769, "text": "Well, I think if you ask that, you're asking about the solution methods."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "I would say that if we have such a thing, it would be a solution to the RL problem."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "Now, what particular methods have been used to get there?"}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Well, we should keep an open mind about the best approaches to actually solve any problem."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And the things we have right now for reinforcement learning, maybe I believe they've got a lot of legs, but maybe we're missing some things."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Maybe there's gonna be better ideas."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "I think we should keep, let's remain modest and we're at the early days of this field and there are many amazing discoveries ahead of us."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "For sure, the specifics, especially of the different kinds of RL approaches currently, there could be other things that fall into the very large umbrella of RL."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "But if it's okay, can we take a step back and kind of ask the basic question of what is to you reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 1822, "text": "So reinforcement learning is the study and the science and the problem of intelligence in the form of an agent that interacts with an environment."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "So the problem you're trying to solve is represented by some environment, like the world in which that agent is situated."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And the goal of RL is clear that the agent gets to take actions."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "Those actions have some effect on the environment and the environment gives back an observation to the agent saying, this is what you see or sense."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And one special thing which it gives back is called the reward signal, how well it's doing in the environment."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And the reinforcement learning problem is to simply take actions over time so as to maximize that reward signal."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "So a couple of basic questions."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "What types of RL approaches are there?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "So I don't know if there's a nice brief inwards way to paint the picture of sort of value based, model based, policy based reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Yeah, so now if we think about, okay, so there's this ambitious problem definition of RL."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "It's really, it's truly ambitious."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "It's trying to capture and encircle all of the things in which an agent interacts with an environment and say, well, how can we formalize and understand what it means to crack that?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "Now let's think about the solution method."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "Well, how do you solve a really hard problem like that?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Well, one approach you can take is to decompose that very hard problem into pieces that work together to solve that hard problem."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And so you can kind of look at the decomposition that's inside the agent's head, if you like, and ask, well, what form does that decomposition take?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And some of the most common pieces that people use when they're kind of putting the solution method together, some of the most common pieces that people use are whether or not that solution has a value function."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "That means, is it trying to predict, explicitly trying to predict how much reward it will get in the future?"}, {"time": 1940, "text": "Does it have a representation of a policy?"}, {"time": 1942, "text": "That means something which is deciding how to pick actions."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Is that decision making process explicitly represented?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "And is there a model in the system?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Is there something which is explicitly trying to predict what will happen in the environment?"}, {"time": 1956, "text": "And so those three pieces are, to me, some of the most common building blocks."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "And I understand the different choices in RL as choices of whether or not to use those building blocks when you're trying to decompose the solution."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Should I have a value function represented?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "Should I have a policy represented?"}, {"time": 1976, "text": "Should I have a model represented?"}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And there are combinations of those pieces and, of course, other things that you could add into the picture as well."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "But those three fundamental choices give rise to some of the branches of RL with which we're very familiar."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And so those, as you mentioned, there is a choice of what's specified or modeled explicitly."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "And the idea is that all of these are somehow implicitly learned within the system."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "So it's almost a choice of how you approach a problem."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "Do you see those as fundamental differences or are these almost like small specifics, like the details of how you solve a problem but they're not fundamentally different from each other?"}, {"time": 2020, "text": "I think the fundamental idea is maybe at the higher level."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "The fundamental idea is the first step of the decomposition is really to say, well, how are we really gonna solve any kind of problem where you're trying to figure out how to take actions and just from this stream of observations, you've got some agent situated in its sensory motor stream and getting all these observations in, getting to take these actions, and what should it do?"}, {"time": 2046, "text": "How can you even broach that problem?"}, {"time": 2047, "text": "You know, maybe the complexity of the world is so great that you can't even imagine how to build a system that would understand how to deal with that."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And so the first step of this decomposition is to say, well, you have to learn."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "The system has to learn for itself."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "And so note that the reinforcement learning problem doesn't actually stipulate that you have to learn."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "Like you could maximize your rewards without learning."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "It would just, wouldn't do a very good job of it."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So learning is required because it's the only way to achieve good performance in any sufficiently large and complex environment."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "So that's the first step."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And so that step gives commonality to all of the other pieces, because now you might ask, well, what should you be learning?"}, {"time": 2088, "text": "What does learning even mean?"}, {"time": 2089, "text": "You know, in this sense, you know, learning might mean, well, you're trying to update the parameters of some system, which is then the thing that actually picks the actions."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "And those parameters could be representing anything."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "They could be parameterizing a value function or a model or a policy."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "And so in that sense, there's a lot of commonality in that whatever is being represented there is the thing which is being learned, and it's being learned with the ultimate goal of maximizing rewards."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "But the way in which you decompose the problem is really what gives the semantics to the whole system."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "Like, are you trying to learn something to predict well, like a value function or a model?"}, {"time": 2128, "text": "Are you learning something to perform well, like a policy?"}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And the form of that objective is kind of giving the semantics to the system."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And so it really is, at the next level down, a fundamental choice, and we have to make those fundamental choices as system designers or enable our algorithms to be able to learn how to make those choices for themselves."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "So then the next step you mentioned, the very first thing you have to deal with is, can you even take in this huge stream of observations and do anything with it?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "So the natural next basic question is, what is deep reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 2168, "text": "And what is this idea of using neural networks to deal with this huge incoming stream?"}, {"time": 2174, "text": "So amongst all the approaches for reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning is one family of solution methods that tries to utilize powerful representations that are offered by neural networks to represent any of these different components of the solution, of the agent, like whether it's the value function or the model or the policy."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "The idea of deep learning is to say, well, here's a powerful toolkit that's so powerful that it's universal in the sense that it can represent any function and it can learn any function."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "And so if we can leverage that universality, that means that whatever we need to represent for our policy or for our value function or for a model, deep learning can do it."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Nevertheless, the fact that neural networks are able to learn incredibly complex representations that allow you to do the policy, the model or the value function is, at least to my mind, exceptionally beautiful and surprising."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Like, was it surprising to you?"}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Can you still believe it works as well as it does?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "Do you have good intuition about why it works at all and works as well as it does?"}, {"time": 2298, "text": "I think, let me take two parts to that question."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "I think it's not surprising to me that the idea of reinforcement learning works because in some sense, I think it's the, I feel it's the only thing which can ultimately."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And so I feel we have to address it and there must be success as possible because we have examples of intelligence."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "And it must at some level be able to, possible to acquire experience and use that experience to do better in a way which is meaningful to environments of the complexity that humans can deal with."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "It must be."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "Am I surprised that our current systems can do as well as they can do?"}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And yet the big surprise is that learning continues and these what appear to be local optima turn out not to be because in high dimensions when we make really big neural nets, there's always a way out and there's a way to go even lower and then you're still not in a local optima because there's some other pathway that will take you out and take you lower still."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And so no matter where you are, learning can proceed and do better and better and better without bound."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "And so that is a surprising and beautiful property of neural nets which I find elegant and beautiful and somewhat shocking that it turns out to be the case."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "As you said, which I really like to our low dimensional intuitions, that's surprising."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "Yeah, we're very tuned to working within a three dimensional environment."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And so to start to visualize what a billion dimensional neural network surface that you're trying to optimize over, what that even looks like is very hard for us."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And so I think that really, if you try to account for the, essentially the AI winter where people gave up on neural networks, I think it's really down to that lack of ability to generalize from low dimensions to high dimensions because back then we were in the low dimensional case."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "People could only build neural nets with 50 nodes in them or something."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "And to imagine that it might be possible to build a billion dimensional neural net and it might have a completely different, qualitatively different property was very hard to anticipate."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "And I think even now we're starting to build the theory to support that."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And it's incomplete at the moment, but all of the theory seems to be pointing in the direction that indeed this is an approach which truly is universal both in its representational capacity, which was known, but also in its learning ability, which is surprising."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "And it makes one wonder what else we're missing due to our low dimensional intuitions that will seem obvious once it's discovered."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "I often wonder, when we one day do have AIs which are superhuman in their abilities to understand the world, what will they think of the algorithms that we developed back now?"}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Will it be looking back at these days and thinking that, will we look back and feel that these algorithms were naive first steps or will they still be the fundamental ideas which are used even in 100,000, 10,000 years?"}, {"time": 2546, "text": "It's hard to know."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "They'll watch back to this conversation and with a smile, maybe a little bit of a laugh."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "I mean, my sense is, I think just like when we used to think that the sun revolved around the earth, they'll see our systems of today, reinforcement learning as too complicated, that the answer was simple all along."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "There's something, just like you said in the game of Go, I mean, I love the systems of like cellular automata, that there's simple rules from which incredible complexity emerges, so it feels like there might be some really simple approaches, just like Rich Sutton says, right?"}, {"time": 2592, "text": "These simple methods with compute over time seem to prove to be the most effective."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "I 100% agree."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "I think that if we try to anticipate what will generalize well into the future, I think it's likely to be the case that it's the simple, clear ideas which will have the longest legs and which will carry us furthest into the future."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "Nevertheless, we're in a situation where we need to make things work today, and sometimes that

a step back to Go, what was MoGo and what was the key idea behind the system?"}, {"time": 2690, "text": "So for example, if you're in the game of Go, the intuition is that you take a position and you get the system to kind of play random moves against itself all the way to the end of the game and you see who wins."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And if black ends up winning more of those random games than white, well, you say, hey, this is a position that favors white."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "And if white ends up winning more of those random games than black, then it favors white."}, {"time":

boards."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And so this was a program by someone called Sylvain Gelli, who's a good colleague of mine, but I worked with him a little bit in those days, part of my PhD thesis."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "And MoGo was a first step towards the latest successes we saw in computer Go, but it was still missing a key ingredient."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "MoGo was evaluating purely by random rollouts against itself."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And in a way, it's truly remarkable that random play should give you anything at all."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Why in this perfectly deterministic game that's very precise and involves these very exact sequences, why is it that randomization is helpful?"}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And so the intuition is that randomization captures something about the nature of the search tree, from a position that you're understanding the nature of the search tree from that node onwards by using randomization."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "And this was a very powerful idea."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "And I've seen this in other spaces, talked to Richard Karp and so on, randomized algorithms somehow magically are able to do exceptionally well and simplifying the problem somehow."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Makes you wonder about the fundamental nature of randomness in our universe."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "It seems to be a useful thing."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "But so from that moment, can you maybe tell the origin story and the journey of AlphaGo?"}, {"time": 2856, "text": "Yeah, so programs based on Monte Carlo tree search were a first revolution in the sense that they led to suddenly programs that could play the game to any reasonable level, but they plateaued."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "It seemed that no matter how much effort people put into these techniques, they couldn't exceed the level of amateur Dan level Go players."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "So strong players, but not anywhere near the level of professionals, nevermind the world champion."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "And so that brings us to the birth of AlphaGo, which happened in the context of a startup company known as DeepMind."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I heard of them."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Where a project was born."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "And the project was really a scientific investigation where myself and Adger Huang and an intern, Chris Madison, were exploring a scientific question."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "And that scientific question was really, is there another fundamentally different approach to this key question of Go, the key challenge of how can you build that intuition and how can you just have a system that could look at a position and understand what move to play or how well you're doing in that position, who's gonna win?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And so the deep learning revolution had just begun."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "That systems like ImageNet had suddenly been won by deep learning techniques back in 2012."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "And following that, it was natural to ask, well, if deep learning is able to scale up so effectively with images to understand them enough to classify them, well, why not go?"}, {"time": 2957, "text": "Why not take the black and white stones of the Go board and build a system which can understand for itself what that means in terms of what move to pick or who's gonna win the game, black or white?"}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And so that was our scientific question which we were probing and trying to understand."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And as we started to look at it, we discovered that we could build a system."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "So in fact, our very first paper on AlphaGo was actually a pure deep learning system which was trying to answer this question."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "And we showed that actually a pure deep learning system with no search at all was actually able to reach human band level, master level at the full game of Go, 19 by 19 boards."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "And so without any search at all, suddenly we had systems which were playing at the level of the best Monte Carlo tree search systems, the ones with randomized rollouts."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So first of all, sorry to interrupt, but that's kind of a groundbreaking notion."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "That's like basically a definitive step away from a couple of decades of essentially search dominating AI."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "So how did that make you feel?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Was it surprising from a scientific perspective in general, how to make you feel?"}, {"time": 3033, "text": "I found this to be profoundly surprising."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "In fact, it was so surprising that we had a bet back then."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "And like many good projects, bets are quite motivating."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And the bet was whether it was possible for a system based purely on deep learning, with no search at all to beat a down level human player."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "And so we had someone who joined our team who was a down level player."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "He came in and we had this first match against him and..."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "Which side of the bed were you on, by the way?"}, {"time": 3069, "text": "The losing or the winning side?"}, {"time": 3071, "text": "I tend to be an optimist with the power of deep learning and reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3078, "text": "So the system won, and we were able to beat this human down level player."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "And for me, that was the moment where it was like, okay, something special is afoot here."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "We have a system which without search is able to already just look at this position and understand things as well as a strong human player."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "And from that point onwards, I really felt that reaching the top levels of human play, professional level, world champion level, I felt it was actually an inevitability."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "And if it was an inevitable outcome, I was rather keen that it would be us that achieved it."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "So we scaled up."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "This was something where, so I had lots of conversations back then with Demis Sassabis, the head of DeepMind, who was extremely excited."}, {"time": 3136, "text": "And we made the decision to scale up the project, brought more people on board."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "And so AlphaGo became something where we had a clear goal, which was to try and crack this outstanding challenge of AI to see if we could beat the world's best players."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "And this led within the space of not so many months to playing against the European champion Fan Hui in a match which became memorable in history as the first time a Go program had ever beaten a professional player."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And at that time we had to make a judgment as to when and whether we should go and challenge the world champion."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "And this was a difficult decision to make."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "Again, we were basing our predictions on our own progress and had to estimate based on the rapidity of our own progress when we thought we would exceed the level of the human world champion."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "And we tried to make an estimate and set up a match and that became the AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol match in 2016."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "And we should say, spoiler alert, that AlphaGo was able to defeat Lee Sedol."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "So maybe we could take even a broader view."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "AlphaGo involves both learning from expert games and as far as I remember, a self play component to where it learns by playing against itself."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "But in your sense, what was the role of learning from expert games there?"}, {"time": 3239, "text": "And in terms of your self evaluation, whether you can take on the world champion, what was the thing that you're trying to do more of?"}, {"time": 3246, "text": "Sort of train more on expert games or was there's now another, I'm asking so many poorly phrased questions, but did you have a hope or dream that self play would be the key component at that moment yet?"}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So in the early days of AlphaGo, we used human data to explore the science of what deep learning can achieve."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And so when we had our first paper that showed that it was possible to predict the winner of the game, that it was possible to suggest moves, that was done using human data."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "A solely human data."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "Yeah, and so the reason that we did it that way was at that time we were exploring separately the deep learning aspect from the reinforcement learning aspect."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "That was the part which was new and unknown to me at that time was how far could that be stretched?"}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Once we had that, it then became natural to try and use that same representation and see if we could learn for ourselves using that same representation."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And so right from the beginning, actually our goal had been to build a system using self play."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "And to us, the human data right from the beginning was an expedient step to help us for pragmatic reasons to go faster towards the goals of the project than we might be able to starting solely from self play."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "And so in those days, we were very aware that we were choosing to use human data and that might not be the longterm holy grail of AI, but that it was something which was extremely useful to us."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "It helped us to understand the system."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "It helped us to build deep learning representations which were clear and simple and easy to use."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "And so really I would say it served a purpose not just as part of the algorithm, but something which I continue to use in our research today, which is trying to break down a very hard challenge into pieces which are easier to understand for us as researchers and develop."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "So if you use a component based on human data, it can help you to understand the system such that then you can build the more principled version later that does it for itself."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So as I said, the AlphaGo victory, and I don't think I'm being sort of romanticizing this notion."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "I think it's one of the greatest moments in the history of AI."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So were you cognizant of this magnitude of the accomplishment at the time?"}, {"time": 3392, "text": "I mean, are you cognizant of it even now?"}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Because to me, I feel like it's something that would, we mentioned what the AGI systems of the future will look back."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "I think they'll look back at the AlphaGo victory as like, holy crap, they figured it out."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "This is where it started."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "Well, thank you again."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "I mean, it's funny because I guess I've been working on, I've been working on ComputerGo for a long time."}, {"time": 3418, "text": "So I'd been working at the time of the AlphaGo match on ComputerGo for more than a decade."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "And throughout that decade, I'd had this dream of what would it be like to, what would it be like really to actually be able to build a system that could play against the world champion."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "And I imagined that that would be an interesting moment that maybe some people might care about that and that this might be a nice achievement."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "But I think when I arrived in Seoul and discovered the legions of journalists that were following us around and the 100 million people that were watching the match online live, I realized that I'd been off in my estimation of how significant this moment was by several orders of magnitude."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And so there was definitely an adjustment process to realize that this was something which the world really cared about and which was a watershed moment."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "And I think there was that moment of realization."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "But it's also a little bit scary because if you go into something thinking it's gonna be maybe of interest and then discover that 100 million people are watching, it suddenly makes you worry about whether some of the decisions you'd made were really the best ones or the wisest, or were going to lead to the best outcome."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "And we knew for sure that there were still imperfections in AlphaGo, which were gonna be exposed to the whole world watching."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And so, yeah, it was I think a great experience and I feel privileged to have been part of it, privileged to have led that amazing team."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "I feel privileged to have been in a moment of history like you say, but also lucky that in a sense I was insulated from the knowledge of, I think it would have been harder to focus on the research if the full kind of reality of what was gonna come to pass had been known to me and the team."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "I think it was, we were in our bubble and we were working on research and we were trying to answer the scientific questions and then bam, the public sees it."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And I think it was better that way in retrospect."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "Were you confident that, I guess, what were the chances that you could get the win?"}, {"time": 3553, "text": "So just like you said, I'm a little bit more familiar with another accomplishment that we may not even get a chance to talk to."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "I talked to Oriel Venialis about Alpha Star which is another incredible accomplishment, but here with Alpha Star and beating the StarCraft, there was already a track record with AlphaGo."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "This is the really first time you get to see reinforcement learning face the best human in the world."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "So what was your confidence like, what was the odds?"}, {"time": 3585, "text": "Well, we actually."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "Was there a bet?"}, {"time": 3587, "text": "Funnily enough, there was."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "So just before the match, we weren't betting on anything concrete, but we all held out a hand."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "Everyone in the team held out a hand at the beginning of the match."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "And the number of fingers that they had out on their hand was supposed to represent how many games they thought we would win against Lee Sedol."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "And there was an amazing spread in the team's predictions."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "But I have to say, I predicted four, one."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And the reason was based purely on data."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "So I'm a scientist first and foremost."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "And one of the things which we had established was that AlphaGo in around one in five games would develop something which we called a delusion, which was a kind of in a hole in its knowledge where it wasn't able to fully understand everything about the position."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "And that hole in its knowledge would persist for tens of moves throughout the game."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "And we knew two things."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "We knew that if there were no delusions, that AlphaGo seemed to be playing at a level that was far beyond any human capabilities."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "But we also knew that if there were delusions, the opposite was true."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And in fact, that's what came to pass."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "We saw all of those outcomes."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "And Lee Sedol in one of the games played a really beautiful sequence that AlphaGo just hadn't predicted."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "And after that, it led it into this situation where it was unable to really understand the position fully and found itself in one of these delusions."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So indeed, yeah, 4.1 was the outcome."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So yeah, and can you maybe speak to it a little bit more?"}, {"time": 3683, "text": "What were the five games?"}, {"time": 3686, "text": "Is there interesting things that come to memory in terms of the play of the human or the machine?"}, {"time": 3693, "text": "So I remember all of these games vividly, of course."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Moments like these don't come too often in the lifetime of a scientist."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And the first game was magical because it was the first time that a computer program had defeated a world champion in this grand challenge of Go."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "And there was a moment where AlphaGo invaded Lee Sedol's territory towards the end of the game."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "And that's quite an audacious thing to do."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "It's like saying, hey, you thought this was going to be your territory in the game, but I'm going to stick a stone right in the middle of it and prove to you that I can break it up."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "And Lee Sedol's face just dropped."}, {"time": 3740, "text": "He wasn't expecting a computer to do something that audacious."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "The second game became famous for a move known as move 37."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "This was a move that was played by AlphaGo that broke all of the conventions of Go, that the Go players were so shocked by this."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "They thought that maybe the operator had made a mistake."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "They thought that there was something crazy going on."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And it just broke every rule that Go players are taught from a very young age."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "They're just taught this kind of move called a shoulder hit."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "You can only play it on the third line or the fourth line, and AlphaGo played it on the fifth line."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "And it turned out to be a brilliant move and made this beautiful pattern in the middle of the board that ended up winning the game."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And so this really was a clear instance where we could say computers exhibited creativity, that this was really a move that was something humans hadn't known about, hadn't anticipated."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "And computers discovered this idea."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "They were the ones to say, actually, here's a new idea, something new, not in the domains of human knowledge of the game."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "And now the humans think this is a reasonable thing to do."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And it's part of Go knowledge now."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "The third game, something special happens when you play against a human world champion, which, again, I hadn't anticipated before going there, which is these players are amazing."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "Lee Sedol was a true champion, 18 time world champion, and had this amazing ability to probe AlphaGo for weaknesses of any kind."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "And in the third game, he was losing, and we felt we were sailing comfortably to victory."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "But he managed to, from nothing, stir up this fight and build what's called a double co, these kind of repetitive positions."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And he knew that historically, no computer Go program had ever been able to deal correctly with double co positions."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And he managed to summon one out of nothing."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And so for us, this was a real challenge."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "Would AlphaGo be able to deal with this, or would it just kind of crumble in the face of this situation?"}, {"time": 3878, "text": "And fortunately, it dealt with it perfectly."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "The fourth game was amazing in that Lee Sedol appeared to be losing this game."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "AlphaGo thought it was winning."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And then Lee Sedol did something, which I think only a true world champion can do, which is he found a brilliant sequence in the middle of the game, a brilliant sequence that led him to really just transform the position."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "He kind of found just a piece of genius, really."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "And after that, AlphaGo, its evaluation just tumbled."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "It thought it was winning this game."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "And all of a sudden, it tumbled and said, oh, now I've got no chance."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And it started to behave rather oddly at that point."}, {"time": 3924, "text": "In the final game, for some reason, we as a team were convinced, having seen AlphaGo in the previous game, suffer from delusions."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "We as a team were convinced that it was suffering from another delusion."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "We were convinced that it was misevaluating the position and that something was going terribly wrong."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "And it was only in the last few moves of the game that we realized that actually, although it had been predicting it was going to win all the way through, it really was."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And so somehow, it just taught us yet again that you have to have faith in your systems."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "When they exceed your own level of ability and your own judgment, you have to trust in them to know better than you, the designer, once you've bestowed in them the ability to judge better than you can, then trust the system to do so."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "So just like in the case of Deep Blue beating Gary Kasparov, so Gary was, I think, the first time he's ever lost, actually, to anybody."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "And I mean, there's a similar situation with Lee Sedol."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "It's a tragic loss for humans, but a beautiful one, I think, that's kind of, from the tragedy, sort of emerges over time, emerges a kind of inspiring story."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "But Lee Sedol recently announced his retirement."},

do you think about these words?"}, {"time": 4025, "text": "What do you think about his retirement from the game ago?"}, {"time": 4028, "text": "Well, let me take you back, first of all, to the first part of your comment about Gary Kasparov, because actually, at the panel yesterday, he specifically said that when he first lost to Deep Blue, he viewed it as a failure."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "He viewed that this had been a failure of his."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "But later on in his career, he said he'd come to realize that actually, it was a success."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "It was a success for everyone, because this marked transformational moment for AI."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "And so even for Gary Kasparov, he came to realize that that moment was pivotal and actually meant something much more than his personal loss in that moment."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "Lee Sedol, I think, was much more cognizant of that, even at the time."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And so in his closing remarks to the match, he really felt very strongly that what had happened in the AlphaGo match was not only meaningful for AI, but for humans as well."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And he felt as a Go player that it had opened his horizons and meant that he could start exploring new things."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "It brought his joy back for the game of Go, because it had broken all of the conventions and barriers and meant that suddenly, anything was possible again."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "So I was sad to hear that he'd retired, but he's been a great world champion over many, many years."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And I think he'll be remembered for that ever more."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "He'll be remembered as the last person to beat AlphaGo."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "I mean, after that, we increased the power of the system."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "And the next version of AlphaGo beats the other strong human player 60 games to nil."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "So what a great moment for him and something to be remembered for."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "It's interesting that you spent time at AAAI on a panel with Garry Kasparov."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "What, I mean, it's almost, I'm just curious to learn the conversations you've had with Garry, because he's also now, he's written a book about artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "He's thinking about AI."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "He has kind of a view of it."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "And he talks about AlphaGo a lot."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Arguably, I'm not just being Russian, but I think Garry is the greatest chess player of all time, probably one of the greatest game players of all time."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And you sort of at the center of creating a system that beats one of the greatest players of all time."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "So what is that conversation like?"}, {"time": 4186, "text": "Is there anything, any interesting digs, any bets, any funny things, any profound things?"}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So Garry Kasparov has an incredible respect for what we did with AlphaGo."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "And it's an amazing tribute coming from him of all people that he really appreciates and respects what we've done."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "And I think he feels that the progress which has happened in computer chess, which later after AlphaGo, we built the AlphaZero system, which defeated the world's strongest chess programs."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "And to Garry Kasparov, that moment in computer chess was more profound than Deep Blue."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "And the reason he believes it mattered more was because it was done with learning and a system which was able to discover for itself new principles, new ideas, which were able to play the game in a way which he hadn't always known about or anyone."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "And in fact, one of the things I discovered at this panel was that the current world champion, Magnus Carlsen, apparently recently commented on his improvement in performance."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "And he attributed it to AlphaZero, that he's been studying the games of AlphaZero."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "And he's changed his style to play more like AlphaZero."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And it's led to him actually increasing his rating to a new peak."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "Yeah, I guess to me, just like to Garry, the inspiring thing is that, and just like you said, with reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning, machine learning feels like what intelligence is."}, {"time": 4289, "text": "And you could attribute it to a bitter viewpoint from Garry's perspective, from us humans perspective, saying that pure search that IBM Deep Blue was doing is not really intelligence, but somehow it didn't feel like it."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And so that's the magical."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I'm not sure what it is about learning that feels like intelligence, but it does."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "So I think we should not demean the achievements of what was done in previous eras of AI."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "I think that Deep Blue was an amazing achievement in itself."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "And that heuristic search of the kind that was used by Deep Blue had some powerful ideas that were in there, but it also missed some things."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "So the fact that the evaluation function, the way that the chess position was understood, was created by humans and not by the machine is a limitation, which means that there's a ceiling on how well it can do."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "But maybe more importantly, it means that the same idea cannot be applied in other domains where we don't have access to the human grandmasters and that ability to encode exactly their knowledge into an evaluation function."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "And the reality is that the story of AI is that most domains turn out to be of the second type where knowledge is messy, it's hard to extract from experts, or it isn't even available."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And so we need to solve problems in a different way."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And I think AlphaGo is a step towards solving things in a way which puts learning as a first class citizen and says systems need to understand for themselves how to understand the world, how to judge the value of any action that they might take within that world and any state they might find themselves in."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "And in order to do that, we make progress towards AI."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "Yeah, so one of the nice things about taking a learning approach to the game of Go or game playing is that the things you learn, the things you figure out, are actually going to be applicable to other problems that are real world problems."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "That's ultimately, I mean, there's two really interesting things about AlphaGo."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "One is the science of it, just the science of learning, the science of intelligence."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "And then the other is while you're actually learning to figuring out how to build systems that would be potentially applicable in other applications, medical, autonomous vehicles, robotics, I mean, it's just open the door to all kinds of applications."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So the next incredible step, really the profound step is probably AlphaGo Zero."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "I mean, it's arguable."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "I kind of see them all as the same place."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "But really, and perhaps you were already thinking that AlphaGo Zero is the natural."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "It was always going to be the next step."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "But it's removing the reliance on human expert games for pre training, as you mentioned."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "So how big of an intellectual leap was this that self play could achieve superhuman level performance in its own?"}, {"time": 4485, "text": "And maybe could you also say, what is self play?"}, {"time": 4488, "text": "Kind of mention it a few times."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "So let me start with self play."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "So the idea of self play is something which is really about systems learning for themselves, but in the situation where there's more than one agent."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And so if you're in a game, and the game is played between two players, then self play is really about understanding that game just by playing games against yourself rather than against any actual real opponent."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "And so it's a way to kind of discover strategies without having to actually need to go out and play against any particular human player, for example."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "The main idea of Alpha Zero was really to try and step back from any of the knowledge that we put into the system and ask the question, is it possible to come up with a single elegant principle by which a system can learn for itself all of the knowledge which it requires to play a game such as Go?"}, {"time": 4560, "text": "Importantly, by taking knowledge out, you not only make the system less brittle in the sense that perhaps the knowledge you were putting in was just getting in the way and maybe stopping the system learning for itself, but also you make it more general."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "The more knowledge you put in, the harder it is for a system to actually be placed, taken out of the system in which it's kind of been designed, and placed in some other system that maybe would need a completely different knowledge base to understand and perform well."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "And so the real goal here is to strip out all of the knowledge that we put in to the point that we can just plug it into something totally different."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "And that, to me, is really the promise of AI is that we can have systems such as that which, no matter what the goal is, no matter what goal we set to the system, we can come up with an algorithm which can be placed into that world, into that environment, and can succeed in achieving that goal."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "And then that, to me, is almost the essence of intelligence if we can achieve that."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "And so AlphaZero is a step towards that."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And it's a step that was taken in the context of two player perfect information games like Go and chess."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "We also applied it to Japanese chess."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "So just to clarify, the first step was AlphaGo Zero."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "The first step was to try and take all of the knowledge out of AlphaGo in such a way that it could play in a fully self discovered way, purely from self play."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "And to me, the motivation for that was always that we could then plug it into other domains."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "But we saved that until later."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Well, in fact, I mean, just for fun, I could tell you exactly the moment where the idea for AlphaZero occurred to me."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "Because I think there's maybe a lesson there for researchers who are too deeply embedded in their research and working 24 sevens to try and come up with the next idea, which is it actually occurred to me on honeymoon."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "And I was at my most fully relaxed state, really enjoying myself, and just bing, the algorithm for AlphaZero just appeared in its full form."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "And this was actually before we played against Lisa Dahl."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "But we just didn't."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "I think we were so busy trying to make sure we could beat the world champion that it was only later that we had the opportunity to step back and start examining that sort of deeper scientific question of whether this could really work."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "So nevertheless, so self play is probably one of the most profound ideas that represents, to me at least, artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "But the fact that you could use that kind of mechanism to, again, beat world class players, that's very surprising."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "So to me, it feels like you have to train in a large number of expert games."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "So was it surprising to you?"}, {"time": 4762, "text": "What was the intuition?"}, {"time": 4763, "text": "Can you sort of think, not necessarily at that time, even now, what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 4767, "text": "Why this thing works so well?"}, {"time": 4770, "text": "Why it's able to learn from scratch?"}, {"time": 4771, "text": "Well, let me first say why we tried it."}, {"time": 4774, "text": "So we tried it both because I feel that it was the deeper scientific question to be asking to make progress towards AI, and also because, in general, in my research, I don't like to do research on questions for which we already know the likely outcome."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "I don't see much value in running an experiment where you're 95% confident that you will succeed."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "And so we could have tried maybe to take AlphaGo and do something which we knew for sure it would succeed on."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "But much more interesting to me was to try it on the things which we weren't sure about."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "And one of the big questions on our minds back then was, could you really do this with self play alone?"}, {"time": 4816, "text": "How far could that go?"}, {"time": 4817, "text": "Would it be as strong?"}, {"time": 4819, "text": "And honestly, we weren't sure."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "It was 50, 50, I think."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "If you'd asked me, I wasn't confident that it could reach the same level as these systems, but it felt like the right question to ask."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "And even if it had not achieved the same level, I felt that that was an important direction to be studying."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "And so then, lo and behold, it actually ended up outperforming the previous version of AlphaGo and indeed was able to beat it by 100 games to zero."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "So what's the intuition as to why?"}, {"time": 4859, "text": "I think the intuition to me is clear, that whenever you have errors in a system, as we did in AlphaGo, AlphaGo suffered from these delusions."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "Occasionally, it would misunderstand what was going on in a position and miss evaluate it."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "How can you remove all of these errors?"}, {"time": 4879, "text": "Errors arise from many sources."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "For us, they were arising both starting from the human data, but also from the nature of the search and the nature of the algorithm itself."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "But the only way to address them in any complex system is to give the system the ability to correct its own errors."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "It must be able to correct them."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "It must be able to learn for itself when it's doing something wrong and correct for it."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "And so it seemed to me that the way to correct delusions was indeed to have more iterations of reinforcement learning, that no matter where you start, you should be able to correct those errors until it gets to play that out and understand, oh, well, I thought that I was going to win in this situation, but then I ended up losing."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "That suggests that I was miss evaluating something."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "There's a hole in my knowledge, and now the system can correct for itself and understand how to do better."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "Now, if you take that same idea and trace it back all the way to the beginning, it should be able to take you from no knowledge, from completely random starting point, all the way to the highest levels of knowledge that you can achieve in a domain."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And the principle is the same, that if you bestow a system with the ability to correct its own errors, then it can take you from random to something slightly better than random because it sees the stupid things that the random is doing, and it can correct them."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "And then it can take you from that slightly better system and understand, well, what's that doing wrong?"}, {"time": 4965, "text": "And it takes you on to the next level and the next level."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "And this progress can go on indefinitely."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "And indeed, what would have happened if we'd carried on training AlphaGo Zero for longer?"}, {"time": 4979, "text": "We saw no sign of it slowing down its improvements, or at least it was certainly carrying on to improve."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "And presumably, if you had the computational resources, this could lead to better and better systems that discover more and more."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "So your intuition is fundamentally there's not a ceiling to this process."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "One of the surprising things, just like you said, is the process of patching errors."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "It intuitively makes sense that this is, that reinforcement learning should be part of that process."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "But what is surprising is in the process of patching your own lack of knowledge, you don't open up other patches."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "You keep sort of, like there's a monotonic decrease of your weaknesses."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "Well, let me back this up."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "I think science always should make falsifiable hypotheses."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "So let me back up this claim with a falsifiable hypothesis, which is that if someone was to, in the future, take Alpha Zero as an algorithm and run it on with greater computational resources that we had available today, then I would predict that they would be able to beat the previous system 100 games to zero."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "And that if they were then to do the same thing a couple of years later, that that would beat that previous system 100 games to zero, and that that process would continue indefinitely throughout at least my human lifetime."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "Presumably the game of Go would set the ceiling."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "The game of Go would set the ceiling, but the game of Go has 10 to the 170 states in it."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "So the ceiling is unreachable by any computational device that can be built out of the 10 to the 80 atoms in the universe."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "You asked a really good question, which is, do you not open up other errors when you correct your previous ones?"}, {"time": 5093, "text": "And the answer is yes, you do."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "And that is the best way that I can play knowing that you're playing perfectly against me."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And so for those cases, we know that even if you do open up some new error, that in some sense you've made progress."}, {"time": 5146, "text": "You're progressing towards the best that can be done."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So AlphaGo was initially trained on expert games with some self play."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "AlphaGo Zero removed the need to be trained on expert games."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "And then another incredible step for me, because I just love chess, is to generalize that further to be in AlphaZero to be able to play the game of Go, beating AlphaGo Zero and AlphaGo, and then also being able to play the game of chess and others."}, {"time": 5179, "text": "So what was that step like?"}, {"time": 5180, "text": "What's the interesting aspects there that required to make that happen?"}, {"time": 5186, "text": "I think the remarkable observation, which we saw with AlphaZero, was that actually without modifying the algorithm at all, it was able to play and crack some of AI's greatest previous challenges."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "In particular, we dropped it into the game of chess."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And unlike the previous systems like Deep Blue, which had been worked on for years and years, and we were able to beat the world's strongest computer chess program convincingly using a system that was fully discovered from scratch with its own principles."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "And in fact, one of the nice things that we found was that in fact, we also achieved the same result in Japanese chess, a variant of chess where you get to capture pieces and then place them back down on your own side as an extra piece."}, {"time": 5238, "text": "So a much more complicated variant of chess."}, {"time": 5241, "text": "And we also beat the world's strongest programs and reached superhuman performance in that game too."}, {"time": 5248, "text": "And it was the very first time that we'd ever run the system on that particular game, was the version that we published in the paper on AlphaZero."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "It just worked out of the box, literally, no touching it."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "We didn't have to do anything."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And there it was, superhuman performance, no tweaking, no twiddling."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "And so I think there's something beautiful about that principle that you can take an algorithm and without twiddling anything, it just works."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "Now, to go beyond AlphaZero, what's required?"}, {"time": 5282, "text": "AlphaZero is just a step."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And there's a long way to go beyond that to really crack the deep problems of AI."}, {"time": 5290, "text": "But one of the important steps is to acknowledge that the world is a really messy place."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "It's this rich, complex, beautiful, but messy environment that we live in."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "And no one gives us the rules."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "Like no one knows the rules of the world."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "At least maybe we understand that it operates according to Newtonian or quantum mechanics at the micro level or according to relativity at the macro level."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "But that's not a model that's useful for us as people to operate in it."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "Somehow the agent needs to understand the world for itself in a way where no one tells it the rules of the game."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And yet it can still figure out what to do in that world, deal with this stream of observations coming in, rich sensory input coming in, actions going out in a way that allows it to reason in the way that AlphaGo or AlphaZero can reason in the way that these go and chess playing programs can reason."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "But in a way that allows it to take actions in that messy world to achieve its goals."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "And so this led us to the most recent step in the story of AlphaGo, which was a system called MuZero."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And MuZero is a system which learns for itself even when the rules are not given to it."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "It actually can be dropped into a system with messy perceptual inputs."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "We actually tried it in some Atari games, the canonical domains of Atari that have been used for reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "And this system learned to build a model of these Atari games that was sufficiently rich and useful enough for it to be able to plan successfully."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "And in fact, that system not only went on to beat the state of the art in Atari, but the same system without modification was able to reach the same level of superhuman performance in go, chess, and shogi that we'd seen in AlphaZero, showing that even without the rules, the system can learn for itself just by trial and error, just by playing this game of go."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "And no one tells you what the rules are, but you just get to the end and someone says win or loss."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "You play this game of chess and someone says win or loss, or you play a game of breakout in Atari and someone just tells you your score at the end."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "And the system for itself figures out essentially the rules of the system, the dynamics of the world, how the world works."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "And not in any explicit way, but just implicitly, enough understanding for it to be able to plan in that system in order to achieve its goals."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And that's the fundamental process that you have to go through when you're facing in any uncertain kind of environment that you would in the real world, is figuring out the sort of the rules, the basic rules of the game."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "So that allows it to be applicable to basically any domain that could be digitized in the way that it needs to in order to be consumable, sort of in order for the reinforcement learning framework to be able to sense the environment, to be able to act in the environment and so on."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "The full reinforcement learning problem needs to deal with worlds that are unknown and complex and the agent needs to learn for itself how to deal with that."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "And so MuZero is a further step in that direction."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "One of the things that inspired the general public and just in conversations I have like with my parents or something with my mom that just loves what was done is kind of at least the notion that there was some display of creativity, some new strategies, new behaviors that were created."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "That again has echoes of intelligence."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So is there something that stands out?"}, {"time": 5510, "text": "Do you see it the same way that there's creativity and there's some behaviors, patterns that you saw that AlphaZero was able to display that are truly creative?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So let me start by saying that I think we should ask what creativity really means."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "So to me, creativity means discovering something which wasn't known before, something unexpected, something outside of our norms."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "And so in that sense, the process of reinforcement learning or the self play approach that was used by AlphaZero is the essence of creativity."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "It's really saying at every stage, you're playing according to your current norms and you try something and if it works out, you say, hey, here's something great, I'm gonna start using that."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "And then that process, it's like a micro discovery that happens millions and millions of times over the course of the algorithm's life where it just discovers some new idea, oh, this pattern, this pattern's working really well for me, I'm gonna start using that."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "And now, oh, here's this other thing I can do, I can start to connect these stones together in this way or I can start to sacrifice stones or give up on pieces or play shoulder hits on the fifth line or whatever it is."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "The system's discovering things like this for itself continually, repeatedly, all the time."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "And so it should come as no surprise to us then when if you leave these systems going, that they discover things that are not known to humans, that to the human norms are considered creative."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "And we've seen this several times."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "In fact, in AlphaGo Zero, we saw this beautiful timeline of discovery where what we saw was that there are these opening patterns that humans play called joseki, these are like the patterns that humans learn to play in the corners and they've been developed and refined over literally thousands of years in the game of Go."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "And what we saw was in the course of the training, AlphaGo Zero, over the course of the 40 days that we trained this system, it starts to discover exactly these patterns that human players play."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "And over time, we found that all of the joseki that humans played were discovered by the system through this process of self play and this sort of essential notion of creativity."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "But what was really interesting was that over time, it then starts to discard some of these in favor of its own joseki that humans didn't know about."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "And it starts to say, oh, well, you thought that the Knights move pincer joseki was a great idea, but here's something different you can do

that, well, there was lots of, there was a lot of debate going on in machine learning about what are the right methods and so on."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "And people were arguing because there were no, there was no way to get hard facts."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And by that, I mean, there were no benchmarks which were truly hard that if you do really well on them, then you can say, look, here's my system."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "That's when you switch from, that's when this field becomes a little bit more of an engineering field."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "So in terms of deep

the missing piece."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It was, you had the, you needed the data, you needed the compute, which showed up in terms of GPUs, and you needed the conviction to realize that you need to mix them together."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "So I guess the presence of compute and the presence of supervised data allowed the empirical evidence to do the convincing of the majority of the computer science community."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So I guess there's a key moment with Jitendra Malik and Alex Alyosha Efros who were very skeptical, right?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And then

just didn't believe for a couple of decades."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Yeah, well, but it's more than that."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "It's kind of, when put this way, it sounds like, well, those silly people who didn't believe, what were they missing?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "But in reality, things were confusing because neural networks really did not work on anything."}, {"time": 1170,

exploration."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "Your variance is much higher."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "But I think there is a lot of unity even there."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I would expect, for example, that at some point there will be some broader unification between RL and supervised learning where somehow the RL will be making decisions to make the supervised learning go better."},

utilizing and there's elements of a really rich sensory space."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So it seems like the union of the two or something like that."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I'd say something slightly differently."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "I'd say that reinforcement learning is neither, but it naturally interfaces and integrates with the two of them."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Do you think action is fundamentally different?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So yeah, what is interesting about, what is unique about policy of learning to act?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Well, so one example, for instance, is that when you learn to act, you are fundamentally in a non stationary world because as your actions change, the things you see start changing."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "You experience the world in a different way."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And this is not the case for the more traditional static problem where you have some distribution and you just apply a model to that

wrong."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "I think the question is a little bit wrong and I wanna explain why."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "So what does it mean for a problem to be hard?"}, {"time": 1504,

changed my mind."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "I'd say language is probably going to be harder."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "I mean, it depends on how you define it."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Like if you

other."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "But I'm not 100% sure."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "And also, I think a lot of it really does depend on your definitions."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Definitions of?"},

you meant to impress you with its intelligence, with how well it understands an image."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "I thought you meant something like, I'm gonna show it a really complicated image and

like the brain."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So maybe if you make it large, if you make the neural network large and you train it on a lot of data, then it will do the same function that the brain does."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "And it turns out to be true, that's crazy."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "And now we just train these neural networks and you make them larger and they keep getting

around the experiment."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "You know, you got around the experiment, it's important."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So it's a bit the same here, except that maybe sometimes the

maybe sort of on the topic of the science of deep learning, talk about one of the recent papers that you released, the Deep Double Descent, where bigger models and more data hurt."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "I think it's a really interesting paper."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Can you describe the main idea?"}, {"time": 2183, "text": "So what happened is that some, over the years, some small number of researchers noticed that it is kind of weird that when you make the neural network larger, it works better and it seems to go in contradiction with statistical ideas."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And then some people made an analysis showing that actually you got this double descent bump."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And what we've done was to show that double descent occurs for pretty much all

larger, you get a very rapid increase in performance."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "Then you continue to make it larger."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "And at some point performance will get worse."},

starts to get better again."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And it's kind of counterintuitive because you'd expect deep learning phenomena to be monotonic."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "And it's hard to be sure what it means, but it also occurs in the case of linear classifiers."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And the intuition basically boils down to the following."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "When you have a large data set and a small model, then small, tiny random, so basically what is overfitting?"}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Overfitting is when your model is somehow very sensitive to the small random unimportant stuff in your data set."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "In the training data."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "In the training data set, precisely."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "So if you have a small model and you have a big data set, and there may be some random thing, some training cases are randomly in the data set and others may not be there, but the small model is kind of insensitive to this randomness because it's the same, there is pretty much no uncertainty about the model when the data set is large."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "So at the very basic level to me, it is the most surprising thing that neural networks don't overfit every time very quickly before ever being able to learn anything."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "The huge number of parameters."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "So here is, so there is one way, okay."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "So maybe, so let me try to give the explanation and maybe that will be, that will work."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "So you've got a huge neural network."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "Let's suppose you've got, you have a huge neural network, you have a huge number of parameters."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And now let's pretend everything is linear, which is not, let's just pretend."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "Then there is this big subspace where your neural network achieves zero error."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "And SGD is going to find approximately the point."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Approximately the point with the smallest norm in that subspace."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And that can also be proven to be insensitive to the small randomness in the data when the dimensionality is high."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "But when the dimensionality of the data is equal to the dimensionality of the model, then there is a one to one correspondence between all the data sets and the models."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "So small changes in the data set actually lead to large changes in the model."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And that's why performance gets worse."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "So this is the best explanation more or less."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "So then it would be good for the model to have more parameters, so to be bigger than the data."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "But only if you don't early stop."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "If you introduce early stop in your regularization, you can make the double descent bump almost completely disappear."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "What is early stop?"}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Early stopping is when you train your model and you monitor your validation performance."},

"text": "So the magic happens after that moment."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "So you don't want to do the early stopping."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "Well, if you don't do the early stopping, you get the very pronounced double descent."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Do you have any intuition why this happens?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "Double descent?"}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Oh, sorry, early stopping?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "No, the double descent."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So the... Well, yeah, so I try... Let's see."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "The intuition is basically is this, that when the data set has as many degrees of freedom as the model, then there is a one to one correspondence between them."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And so small changes to the data set lead to noticeable changes in the model."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "So your model is very sensitive to all the randomness."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "It is unable to discard it."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Whereas it turns out that when you have a lot more data than parameters or a lot more parameters than data, the resulting solution

randomness, exactly."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "The spurious correlation which you don't want."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Jeff Hinton suggested we need to throw back propagation."}, {"time": 2482,

little bit wit and humor, but what do you think?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "What could be an alternative method of training neural networks?"}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Well, the thing that he said precisely is that to the extent that you can't find back propagation in the brain, it's worth seeing if we can learn something from how the brain learns."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "But back propagation is very useful and we should keep using it."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "Oh, you're saying that once we discover the mechanism of learning in the brain, or any aspects of that mechanism, we

propagation in the brain."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "Well, so I guess your answer to that is back propagation is pretty damn useful."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "So why are we complaining?"}, {"time": 2534, "text": "I mean, I personally am a big fan of back propagation."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "I think it's a great algorithm because it solves an extremely fundamental problem, which is finding a neural circuit subject to some constraints."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And I don't see that problem going away."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "So that's why I really, I think it's pretty unlikely that

picture question."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "Well, if you look, for example, at AlphaGo or AlphaZero, the neural network of AlphaZero plays Go, which we all agree is a game that requires reasoning, better than 99.9% of all humans."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Just the neural network, without the search, just the neural network itself."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Doesn't that give us an existence proof that neural networks can reason?"}, {"time": 2595, "text": "To push back and disagree a little bit, we all agree that Go is reasoning."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "I think I agree, I don't think it's a trivial, so obviously reasoning like intelligence is a loose gray area term a little bit."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Maybe you disagree with that."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "But yes, I think it has some of the same elements of reasoning."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "Reasoning is almost like akin to search, right?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "There's a sequential element of reasoning of stepwise consideration of possibilities and sort of building on top of those possibilities in a sequential manner until you arrive at some insight."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "So yeah, I guess playing Go is kind of like that."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "And when you have a single neural network doing that without search, it's kind of like that."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "So there's an existence proof in a particular constrained environment that a process akin to what many people call reasoning exists, but more general kind of reasoning."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So off the board."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "There is one other existence proof."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "Oh boy, which one?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "Us humans?"}, {"time": 2663, "text": "Okay, all right, so do you think the architecture that will allow neural networks to reason will look similar to the neural network architectures we have today?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "I think it will."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "I think, well, I don't wanna make two overly definitive statements."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "I think it's definitely possible that the neural networks that will produce the reasoning breakthroughs of the future will be very similar to the architectures that exist today."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "Maybe a little bit more recurrent, maybe a little bit deeper."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "But these neural nets are so insanely powerful."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Why wouldn't they be able to learn to reason?"}, {"time": 2705, "text": "Humans can reason."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "So why can't neural networks?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "So do you think the kind of stuff we've seen neural networks do is a kind of just weak reasoning?"}, {"time": 2714, "text": "So it's not a fundamentally different process."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Again, this is stuff nobody knows the answer to."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "So when it comes to our neural networks, the thing which I would say is that neural networks are capable of reasoning."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "But if you train a neural network on a task which doesn't require reasoning, it's not going to reason."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "This is a well known effect where the neural network will solve the problem that you pose in front of it in the easiest way possible."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "Right, that takes us to one of the brilliant sort of ways you've described neural networks, which is you've referred to neural networks as the search for small circuits and maybe general intelligence as the search for small programs, which I found as a metaphor very compelling."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "Can you elaborate on that difference?"}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Yeah, so the thing which I said precisely was that if you can find the shortest program that outputs the data at your disposal, then you will be able to use it to make the best prediction possible."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And that's a theoretical statement which can be proved mathematically."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Now, you can also prove mathematically that finding the shortest program which generates some data is not a computable operation."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "No finite amount of compute can do this."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "So then with neural networks, neural networks are the next best thing that actually works in practice."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "We are not able to find the best, the shortest program which generates our data, but we are able to find a small, but now that statement should be amended, even a large circuit which fits our data in some way."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "Well, I think what you meant by the small circuit is the smallest needed circuit."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Well, the thing which I would change now, back then I really haven't fully internalized the overparameterized results."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "The things we know about overparameterized neural nets, now I would phrase it as a large circuit whose weights contain a small amount of information, which I think is what's going on."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "If you imagine the training process of a neural network as you slowly transmit entropy from the dataset to the parameters, then somehow the amount of information in the weights ends up being not very large, which would explain why they generalize so well."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So the large circuit might be one that's helpful for the generalization."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "Yeah, something like this."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "But do you see it important to be able to try to learn something like programs?"}, {"time": 2882, "text": "I mean, if we can, definitely."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "I think it's kind of, the answer is kind of yes, if we can do it, we should do things that we can do it."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "It's the reason we are pushing on deep learning, the fundamental reason, the root cause is that we are able to train them."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "So in other words, training comes first."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "We've got our pillar, which is the training pillar."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And now we're trying to contort our neural networks around the training pillar."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "We gotta stay trainable."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "This is an invariant we cannot violate."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And so being trainable means starting from scratch, knowing nothing, you can actually pretty quickly converge towards knowing a lot."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "Or even slowly."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "But it means that given the resources at your disposal, you can train the neural net and get it to achieve useful performance."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "Yeah, that's a pillar we can't move away from."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Because if you say, hey, let's find the shortest program, well, we can't do that."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "So it doesn't matter how useful that would be."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "We can't do it."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "So we won't."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So do you think, you kind of mentioned that the neural networks are good at finding small circuits or large circuits."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Do you think then the matter of finding small programs is just the data?"}, {"time": 2960, "text": "So the, sorry, not the size or the type of data."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "Sort of ask, giving it programs."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Well, I think the thing is that right now, finding, there are no good precedents of people successfully finding programs really well."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And so the way you'd find programs is you'd train a deep neural network to do it basically."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "Which is the right way to go about it."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "But there's not good illustrations of that."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "It hasn't been done yet."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "But in principle, it should be possible."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "Can you elaborate a little bit, what's your answer in principle?"}, {"time": 3000, "text": "Put another way, you don't see why it's not possible."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Well, it's kind of like more, it's more a statement of, I think that it's, I think that it's unwise to bet against deep learning."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And if it's a cognitive function that humans seem to be able to do, then it doesn't take too long for some deep neural net to pop up that can do it too."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Yeah, I'm there with you."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "I've stopped betting against neural networks at this point because they continue to surprise us."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "What about long term memory?"}, {"time": 3037, "text": "Can neural networks have long term memory?"}, {"time": 3039, "text": "Something like knowledge bases."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "So being able to aggregate important information over long periods of time that would then serve as useful sort of representations of state that you can make decisions by, so have a long term context based on which you're making the decision."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "So in some sense, the parameters already do that."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "The parameters are an aggregation of the neural, of the entirety of the neural nets experience, and so they count as long term knowledge."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "And people have trained various neural nets to act as knowledge bases and, you know, investigated with, people have investigated language models as knowledge bases."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "So there is work there."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "Yeah, but in some sense, do you think in every sense, do you think there's a, it's all just a matter of coming up with a better mechanism of forgetting the useless stuff and remembering the useful stuff?"}, {"time": 3100, "text": "Because right now, I mean, there's not been mechanisms that do remember really long term information."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "What do you mean by that precisely?"}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Precisely, I like the word precisely."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "So I'm thinking of the kind of compression of information the knowledge bases represent."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "Sort of creating a, now I apologize for my sort of human centric thinking about what knowledge is, because neural networks aren't interpretable necessarily with the kind of knowledge they have discovered."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "But a good example for me is knowledge bases, being able to build up over time something like the knowledge that Wikipedia represents."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "It's a really compressed, structured knowledge base."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Obviously not the actual Wikipedia or the language, but like a semantic web, the dream that semantic web represented, so it's a really nice compressed knowledge base or something akin to that in the noninterpretable sense as neural networks would have."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "Well, the neural networks would be noninterpretable if you look at their weights, but their outputs should be very interpretable."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "Okay, so yeah, how do you make very smart neural networks like language models interpretable?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Well, you ask them to generate some text and the text will generally be interpretable."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "Do you find that the epitome of interpretability, like can you do better?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Like can you add, because you can't, okay, I'd like to know what does it know and what doesn't it know?"}, {"time": 3192, "text": "I would like the neural network to come up with examples where it's completely dumb and examples where it's completely brilliant."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And the only way I know how to do that now is to generate a lot of examples and use my human judgment."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "But it would be nice if a neural network had some self awareness about it."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "Yeah, 100%, I'm a big believer in self awareness and I think that, I think neural net self awareness will allow for things like the capabilities, like the ones you described, like for them to know what they know and what they don't know and for them to know where to invest to increase their skills most optimally."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And to your question of interpretability, there are actually two answers to that question."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "One answer is, you know, we have the neural net so we can analyze the neurons and we can try to understand what the different neurons and different layers mean."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And you can actually do that and OpenAI has done some work on that."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "But there is a different answer, which is that, I would say that's the human centric answer where you say, you know, you look at a human being, you can't read, how do you know what a human being is thinking?"}, {"time": 3258, "text": "You ask them, you say, hey, what do you think about this?"}, {"time": 3262, "text": "And you get some answers."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "The answers you get are sticky in the sense you already have a mental model."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "You already have a mental model of that human being."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "You already have an understanding of like a big conception of that human being, how they think, what they know, how they see the world and then everything you ask, you're adding onto that."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And that stickiness seems to be, that's one of the really interesting qualities of the human being is that information is sticky."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "You don't, you seem to remember the useful stuff, aggregate it well and forget most of the information that's not useful, that process."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "But that's also pretty similar to the process that neural networks do."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "It's just that neural networks are much crappier at this time."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "It doesn't seem to be fundamentally that different."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "But just to stick on reasoning for a little longer, you said, why not?"}, {"time": 3318, "text": "Why can't I reason?"}, {"time": 3319, "text": "What's a good impressive feat, benchmark to you of reasoning that you'll be impressed by if neural networks were able to do?"}, {"time": 3330, "text": "Is that something you already have in mind?"}, {"time": 3332, "text": "Well, I think writing really good code, I think proving really hard theorems, solving open ended problems with out of the box solutions."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And sort of theorem type, mathematical problems."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "Yeah, I think those ones are a very natural example as well."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "If you can prove an unproven theorem, then it's hard to argue you don't reason."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "And so by the way, and this comes back to the point about the hard results, if you have machine learning, deep learning as a field is very fortunate because we have the ability to sometimes produce these unambiguous results."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "And when they happen, the debate changes, the conversation changes."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "It's a converse, we have the ability to produce conversation changing results."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "Conversation, and then of course, just like you said, people kind of take that for granted and say that wasn't actually a hard problem."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "Well, I mean, at some point we'll probably run out of hard problems."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Yeah, that whole mortality thing is kind of a sticky problem that we haven't quite figured out."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Maybe we'll solve that one."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I think one of the fascinating things in your entire body of work, but also the work at OpenAI recently, one of the conversation changes has been in the world of language models."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Can you briefly kind of try to describe the recent history of using neural networks in the domain of language and text?"}, {"time": 3414, "text": "Well, there's been lots of history."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "I think the Elman network was a small, tiny recurrent neural network applied to language back in the 80s."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "So the history is really, you know, fairly long at least."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "And the thing that started, the thing that changed the trajectory of neural networks and language is the thing that changed the trajectory of all deep learning and that's data and compute."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "So suddenly you move from small language models, which learn a little bit, and with language models in particular, there's a very clear explanation for why they need to be large to be good, because they're trying to predict the next word."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So when you don't know anything, you'll notice very, very broad strokes, surface level patterns, like sometimes there are characters and there is a space between those characters."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "You'll notice this pattern."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "And you'll notice that sometimes there is a comma and then the next character is a capital letter."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "You'll notice that pattern."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Eventually you may start to notice that there are certain words occur often."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "You may notice that spellings are a thing."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "You may notice syntax."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "And when you get really good at all these, you start to notice the semantics."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "You start to notice the facts."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "But for that to happen, the language model needs to be larger."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "So that's, let's linger on that, because that's where you and Noam Chomsky disagree."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "So you think we're actually taking incremental steps, a sort of larger network, larger compute will be able to get to the semantics, to be able to understand language without what Noam likes to sort of think of as a fundamental understandings of the structure of language, like imposing your theory of language onto the learning mechanism."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "So you're saying the learning, you can learn from raw data, the mechanism that underlies language."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "Well, I think it's pretty likely, but I also want to say that I don't really know precisely what Chomsky means when he talks about him."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "You said something about imposing your structural language."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "I'm not 100% sure what he means, but empirically it seems that when you inspect those larger language models, they exhibit signs of understanding the semantics whereas the smaller language models do not."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "We've seen that a few years ago when we did work on the sentiment neuron."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "We trained a small, you know, smallish LSTM to predict the next character in Amazon reviews."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "And we noticed that when you increase the size of the LSTM from 500 LSTM cells to 4,000 LSTM cells, then one of the neurons starts to represent the sentiment of the article, sorry, of the review."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "Sentiment is a pretty semantic attribute."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "It's not a syntactic attribute."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "And for people who might not know, I don't know if that's a standard term, but sentiment is whether it's a positive or a negative review."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Is the person happy with something or is the person unhappy with something?"}, {"time": 3595, "text": "And so here we had very clear evidence that a small neural net does not capture sentiment while a large neural net does."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And why is that?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "Well, our theory is that at some point you run out of syntax to models, you start to gotta focus on something else."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "And with size, you quickly run out of syntax to model and then you really start to focus on the semantics would be the idea."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "And so I don't wanna imply that our models have complete semantic understanding because that's not true, but they definitely are showing signs of semantic understanding, partial semantic understanding, but the smaller models do not show those signs."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "Can you take a step back and say, what is GPT2, which is one of the big language models that was the conversation changer in the past couple of years?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "Yeah, so GPT2 is a transformer with one and a half billion parameters that was trained on about 40 billion tokens of text which were obtained from web pages that were linked to from Reddit articles with more than three outputs."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "And what's a transformer?"}, {"time": 3663, "text": "The transformer, it's the most important advance in neural network architectures in recent history."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "What is attention maybe too?"}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Cause I think that's an interesting idea, not necessarily sort of technically speaking, but the idea of attention versus maybe what recurrent neural networks represent."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "Yeah, so the thing is the transformer is a combination of multiple ideas simultaneously of which attention is one."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "Do you think attention is the key?"}, {"time": 3689, "text": "No, it's a key, but it's not the key."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "The transformer is successful because it is the simultaneous combination of multiple ideas."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "And if you were to remove either idea, it would be much less successful."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "So the transformer uses a lot of attention, but attention existed for a few years."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "So that can't be the main innovation."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "The transformer is designed in such a way that it runs really fast on the GPU."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "And that makes a huge amount of difference."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "This is one thing."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "The second thing is that transformer is not recurrent."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "And that is really important too, because it is more shallow and therefore much easier to optimize."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "So in other words, users attention, it is a really great fit to the GPU and it is not recurrent, so therefore less deep and easier to optimize."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "And the combination of those factors make it successful."}, {"time": 3740, "text": "So now it makes great use of your GPU."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "It allows you to achieve better results for the same amount of compute."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "And that's why it's successful."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "Were you surprised how well transformers worked and GPT2 worked?"}, {"time": 3756, "text": "So you worked on language."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "You've had a lot of great ideas before transformers came about in language."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "So you got to see the whole set of revolutions before and after."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Were you surprised?"}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Yeah, a little."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "A little?"}, {"time": 3770, "text": "I mean, it's hard to remember because you adapt really quickly, but it definitely was surprising."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "It definitely was."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "In fact, you know what?"}, {"time": 3779, "text": "I'll retract my statement."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "It was pretty amazing."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "It was just amazing to see generate this text of this."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "And you know, you gotta keep in mind that at that time we've seen all this progress in GANs in improving the samples produced by GANs were just amazing."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "You have these realistic faces, but text hasn't really moved that much."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "And suddenly we moved from, you know, whatever GANs were in 2015 to the best, most amazing GANs in one step."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "And that was really stunning."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "Even though theory predicted, yeah, you train a big language model, of course you should get this, but then to see it with your own eyes, it's something else."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And yet we adapt really quickly."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "And now there's sort of some cognitive scientists write articles saying that GPT2 models don't truly understand language."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "So we adapt quickly to how amazing the fact that they're able to model the language so well is."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "So what do you think is the bar?"}, {"time": 3839, "text": "For impressing us that it..."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "Do you think that bar will continuously be moved?"}, {"time": 3846, "text": "I think when you start to see really dramatic economic impact, that's when I think that's in some sense the next barrier."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "Because right now, if you think about the work in AI, it's really confusing."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "It's really hard to know what to make of all these advances."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "It's kind of like, okay, you got an advance and now you can do more things and you've got another improvement and you've got another cool demo."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "At some point, I think people who are outside of AI, they can no longer distinguish this progress anymore."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "So we were talking offline about translating Russian to English and how there's a lot of brilliant work in Russian that the rest of the world doesn't know about."},

to see sort of economic big impact?"}, {"time": 3897, "text": "I think there is a huge number of..."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "I mean, first of all, I wanna point out that translation already today is huge."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "I think billions of people interact with big chunks of the internet primarily through translation."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "So translation is already huge and it's hugely positive too."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "I think self driving is going to be hugely impactful and that's, it's unknown exactly when it happens, but again, I would not bet against deep learning,

for self driving."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "But I was talking about sort of language models."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Just to check."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Beard off a little bit."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "Just to check, you're not seeing a connection between driving and language."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "Or rather both use neural nets."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "That'd be a poetic connection."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "I think there might be some, like you said, there might be some kind of unification towards a kind of multitask transformers that can take on both language and vision tasks."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "That'd be an interesting unification."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "Now let's see, what can I ask about GPT two more?"}, {"time": 3965, "text": "There's not much to ask."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "It's, you take a transform, you make it bigger, you give it more data, and suddenly it does all those amazing things."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "Yeah, one of the beautiful things is that GPT, the transformers are fundamentally simple to explain, to train."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Do you think bigger will continue to show better results in language?"}, {"time": 3988, "text": "Sort of like what are the next steps with GPT two, do you think?"}, {"time": 3991, "text": "I mean, I think for sure seeing what larger versions can do is one direction."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "Also, I mean, there are many questions."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "There's one question which I'm curious about and that's the following."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "So right now GPT two, so we feed it all this data from the internet, which means that it needs to memorize all those random facts about everything in the internet."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "And it would be nice if the model could somehow use its own intelligence to decide what data it wants to accept and what data it wants to reject."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "Just like people."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "People don't learn all data indiscriminately."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "We are super selective about what we learn."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "And I think this kind of active learning, I think would be very nice to have."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Yeah, listen, I love active learning."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "So let me ask, does the selection of data, can you just elaborate that a little bit more?"}, {"time": 4043, "text": "Do you think the selection of data is, like I have this kind of sense that the optimization of how you select data, so the active learning process is going to be a place for a lot of breakthroughs, even in the near future?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "Because there hasn't been many breakthroughs there that are public."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "I feel like there might be private breakthroughs that companies keep to themselves because the fundamental problem has to be solved if you want to solve self driving, if you want to solve a particular task."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "What do you think about the space in general?"}, {"time": 4077, "text": "Yeah, so I think that for something like active learning, or in fact, for any kind of capability, like active learning, the thing that it really needs is a problem."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "It needs a problem that requires it."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "It's very hard to do research about the capability if you don't have a task, because then what's going to happen is that you will come up with an artificial task, get good results, but not really convince anyone."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "Right, like we're now past the stage where getting a result on MNIST, some clever formulation of MNIST will convince people."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "That's right, in fact, you could quite easily come up with a simple active learning scheme on MNIST and get a 10x speed up, but then, so what?"}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And I think that with active learning, the need, active learning will naturally arise as problems that require it pop up."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "That's how I would, that's my take on it."}, {"time": 4131, "text": "There's another interesting thing that OpenAI has brought up with GPT2, which is when you create a powerful artificial intelligence system, and it was unclear what kind of detrimental, once you release GPT2, what kind of detrimental effect it will have."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "Because if you have a model that can generate a pretty realistic text, you can start to imagine that it would be used by bots in some way that we can't even imagine."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "So there's this nervousness about what is possible to do."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "So you did a really kind of brave and I think profound thing, which is start a conversation about this."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "How do we release powerful artificial intelligence models to the public?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "If we do it all, how do we privately discuss with other, even competitors, about how we manage the use of the systems and so on?"}, {"time": 4186, "text": "So from this whole experience, you released a report on it, but in general, are there any insights that you've gathered from just thinking about this, about how you release models like this?"}, {"time": 4197, "text": "I mean, I think that my take on this is that the field of AI has been in a state of childhood."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "And now it's exiting that state and it's entering a state of maturity."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "What that means is that AI is very successful and also very impactful."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And its impact is not only large, but it's also growing."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And so for that reason, it seems wise to start thinking about the impact of our systems before releasing them, maybe a little bit too soon, rather than a little bit too late."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "And with the case of GPT2, like I mentioned earlier, the results really were stunning."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "And it seemed plausible, it didn't seem certain, it seemed plausible that something like GPT2 could easily use to reduce the cost of this information."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "And so there was a question of what's the best way to release it, and a staged release seemed logical."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "A small model was released, and there was time to see the, many people use these models in lots of cool ways."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "There've been lots of really cool applications."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "There haven't been any negative application to be known of."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "And so eventually it was released, but also other people replicated similar models."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "That's an interesting question though that we know of."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "So in your view, staged release, is at least part of the answer to the question of how do we, what do we do once we create a system like this?"}, {"time": 4282, "text": "It's part of the answer, yes."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "Is there any other insights?"}, {"time": 4286, "text": "Like say you don't wanna release the model at all, because it's useful to you for whatever the business is."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "Well, plenty of people don't release models already."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "Right, of course, but is there some moral, ethical responsibility when you have a very powerful model to sort of communicate?"}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Like, just as you said, when you had GPT2, it was unclear how much it could be used for misinformation."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "It's an open question, and getting an answer to that might require that you talk to other really smart people that are outside of your particular group."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Have you, please tell me there's some optimistic pathway for people to be able to use this model for people across the world to collaborate on these kinds of cases?"}, {"time": 4334, "text": "Or is it still really difficult from one company to talk to another company?"}, {"time": 4339, "text": "So it's definitely possible."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "It's definitely possible to discuss these kind of models with colleagues elsewhere, and to get their take on what to do."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "How hard is it though?"}, {"time": 4356, "text": "Do you see that happening?"}, {"time": 4358, "text": "I think that's a place where it's important to gradually build trust between companies."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "Because ultimately, all the AI developers are building technology which is going to be increasingly more powerful."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "And so it's, the way to think about it is that ultimately we're all in it together."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Yeah, I tend to believe in the better angels of our nature, but I do hope that when you build a really powerful AI system in a particular domain, that you also think about the potential negative consequences of, yeah."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "It's an interesting and scary possibility that there will be a race for AI development that would push people to close that development, and not share ideas with others."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "I don't love this."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "I've been a pure academic for 10 years."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "I really like sharing ideas and it's fun, it's exciting."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "What do you think it takes to, let's talk about AGI a little bit."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "We talked about reasoning, we talked about long term memory, but in general, what does it take, do you think?"}, {"time": 4431, "text": "Well, I can't be sure."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "But I think the deep learning, plus maybe another, plus maybe another small idea."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "Do you think self play will be involved?"}, {"time": 4445, "text": "So you've spoken about the powerful mechanism of self play where systems learn by sort of exploring the world in a competitive setting against other entities that are similarly skilled as them, and so incrementally improve in this way."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "Do you think self play will be a component of building an AGI system?"}, {"time": 4466, "text": "Yeah, so what I would say, to build AGI, I think it's going to be deep learning plus some ideas."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And I think self play will be one of those ideas."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "I think that that is a very, self play has this amazing property that it can surprise us in truly novel ways."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "For example, like we, I mean, pretty much every self play system, both are Dota bot."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I don't know if, OpenAI had a release about multi agent where you had two little agents who were playing hide and seek."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And of course, also alpha zero."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "They were all produced surprising behaviors."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "They all produce behaviors that we didn't expect."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "They are creative solutions to problems."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And that seems like an important part of AGI that our systems don't exhibit routinely right now."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "And so that's why I like this area."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "I like this direction because of its ability to surprise us."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "To surprise us."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "And an AGI system would surprise us fundamentally."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "And to be precise, not just a random surprise, but to find the surprising solution to a problem that's also useful."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "Now, a lot of the self play mechanisms have been used in the game context or at least in the simulation context."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "How far along the path to AGI do you think will be done in simulation?"}, {"time": 4556, "text": "How much faith, promise do you have in simulation

robotics."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "I don't think it's an easy or."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "I think simulation is a tool and it helps."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "It has certain strengths and certain weaknesses and we should use it."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Yeah, but okay, I understand that."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "That's true, but one of the criticisms of self play, one of the criticisms of reinforcement learning is one of the, its current power, its current results, while amazing, have been demonstrated in a simulated environments or very constrained physical environments."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "Do you think it's possible to escape them, escape the simulator environments and be able to learn in non simulator environments?"}, {"time": 4613, "text": "Or do you think it's possible to also just simulate in a photo realistic and physics realistic way, the real world in a way that we can solve real problems with self play in simulation?"}, {"time": 4626, "text": "So I think that transfer from simulation to the real world is definitely possible and has been exhibited many times by many different groups."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "It's been especially successful in vision."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "Also open AI in the summer has demonstrated a robot hand which was trained entirely in simulation in a certain way that allowed for seem to real transfer to occur."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "Is this for the Rubik's cube?"}, {"time": 4652, "text": "I wasn't aware that was trained in simulation."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "It was trained in simulation entirely."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "Really, so it wasn't in the physical, the hand wasn't trained?"}, {"time": 4660, "text": "No, 100% of the training was done in simulation and the policy that was learned in simulation was trained to be very adaptive."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "So adaptive that when you transfer it, it could very quickly adapt to the physical world."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "So the kind of perturbations with the giraffe or whatever the heck it was, those weren't, were those part of the simulation?"}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Well, the simulation was generally, so the simulation was trained to be robust to many different things, but not the kind of perturbations we've had in the video."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So it's never been trained with a glove."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "It's never been trained with a stuffed giraffe."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "So in theory, these are novel perturbations."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "Correct, it's not in theory, in practice."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "Those are novel perturbations?"}, {"time": 4703, "text": "Well, that's okay."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "That's a clean, small scale, but clean example of a transfer from the simulated world to the physical world."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "Yeah, and I will also say that I expect the transfer capabilities of deep learning to increase in general."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "And the better the transfer capabilities are, the more useful simulation will become."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "Because then you could take, you could experience something in simulation and then learn a moral of the story, which you could then carry with you to the real world."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "As humans do all the time when they play computer games."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "So let me ask sort of a embodied question, staying on AGI for a sec."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "Do you think AGI system would need to have a body?"}, {"time": 4747, "text": "We need to have some of those human elements of self awareness, consciousness, sort of fear of mortality, sort of self preservation in the physical space, which comes with having a body."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "I think having a body will be useful."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "I don't think it's necessary, but I think it's very useful to have a body for sure, because you can learn a whole new, you can learn things which cannot be learned without a body."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "But at the same time, I think that if you don't have a body, you could compensate for it and still succeed."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "Well, there is evidence for this."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "For example, there are many people who were born deaf and blind and they were able to compensate for the lack of modalities."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "I'm thinking about Helen Keller specifically."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "So even if you're not able to physically interact with the world, and if you're not able to, I mean, I actually was getting at, maybe let me ask on the more particular, I'm not sure if it's connected to having a body or not, but the idea of consciousness and a more constrained version of that is self awareness."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "Do you think an AGI system should have consciousness?"}, {"time": 4816, "text": "We can't define, whatever the heck you think consciousness is."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "Yeah, hard question to answer, given how hard it is to define it."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "Do you think it's useful to think about?"}, {"time": 4826, "text": "I mean, it's definitely interesting."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "I think it's definitely possible that our systems will be conscious."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "Do you think that's an emergent thing that just comes from, do you think consciousness could emerge from the representation that's stored within neural networks?"}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So like that it naturally just emerges when you become more and more, you're able to represent more and more of the world?"}, {"time": 4847, "text": "Well, I'd say I'd make the following argument, which is humans are conscious."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "And if you believe that artificial neural nets are sufficiently similar to the brain, then there should at least exist artificial neural nets you should be conscious too."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "You're leaning on that existence proof pretty heavily."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "Okay, so that's the best answer I can give."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "No, I know, I know, I know."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "There's still an open question if there's not some magic in the brain that we're not, I mean, I don't mean a non materialistic magic, but that the brain might be a lot more complicated and interesting than we give it credit for."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "If that's the case, then it should show up."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "And at some point we will find out that we can't continue to make progress."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "But I think it's unlikely."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "So we talk about consciousness, but let me talk about another poorly defined concept of intelligence."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "Again, we've talked about reasoning, we've talked about memory."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "What do you think is a good test of intelligence for you?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Are you impressed by the test that Alan Turing formulated with the imitation game with natural language?"}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Is there something in your mind that you will be deeply impressed by if a system was able to do?"}, {"time": 4926, "text": "I mean, lots of things."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "There's a certain frontier of capabilities today."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "And there exist things outside of that frontier."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "And I would be impressed by any such thing."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "For example, I would be impressed by a deep learning system

think that is something which have not yet been demonstrated and I would find it very impressive."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "Yeah, so right now they make mistakes in different, they might be more accurate than human beings, but they still, they make a different set of mistakes."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "So my, I would guess that a lot of the skepticism that some people have about deep learning is when they look at their mistakes and they say, well, those mistakes, they make no sense."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Like if you understood the concept, you wouldn't make that mistake."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "And I think that changing that would be, that would inspire me."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "That would be, yes, this is progress."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "Yeah, that's a really nice way to put it."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "But I also just don't like that human instinct to criticize a model is not intelligent."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "That's the same instinct as we do when we criticize any group of creatures as the other."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "Because it's very possible that GPT2 is much smarter than human beings at many things."}, {"time": 5016, "text":

thing."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "This is the process of, in the 21st century, the process of analyzing the progress of AI is the search for one case where the system fails in a big way where humans would not."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And then many people writing articles about it."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And then broadly, the public generally gets convinced that the system is not intelligent."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "And we pacify ourselves by thinking it's not intelligent because of this one anecdotal case."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "And this seems to continue happening."},

something."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "How impressed should you be?"}, {"time": 5092, "text": "And I think that people will start to be impressed once AI starts to really move the needle on the GDP."},

you think you would do?"}, {"time": 5205, "text": "Well, the ideal world I'd like to imagine is one where humanity, I like, the board members of a company where the AGI is the CEO."}, {"time": 5219,

the 1950s and early 1960s, most computing was done on very big computers, physically big, although not terribly powerful by today's standards, that were maintained in very large rooms and you use things like punch cards to write your programs on and talk to them."}, {"time": 347, "text": "So you would take a deck of cards, write your program on it, send it over a counter, hand it to an

the idea of time sharing was that you take basically that same computer, but connect to it with something that looked like an electric typewriter."}, {"time": 369, "text": "They could be a long

the file system."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And then one of those ideas, one of those generalizations is that gee, that file system interface works for all kinds of other things as well."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And so in particular, the idea of reading and writing to devices is the same as reading and writing to a disc that has a file system."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And then that gets

kind of more formal view of it."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "Same thing for data structures."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But also it's, I think, an engineering field as well."}, {"time": 1990, "text":

set of files, and then within each file, it writes through each of the lines."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "And then on each of the lines, it has a set of patterns that it looks for."}, {"time": 2253,

each line, there is fields separated by white space or something."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And so it does that for free."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "And it collects information as it goes along, like what line are we on?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "How many fields are there on this line?"}, {"time": 2298, "text": "So lots of things that just make it so that a program which in another language, let's say Python, would be five, 10, 20 lines in AUC is one or two lines."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And so because it's one or two lines, you can do it on the shell."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "You don't have to open up another whole thing."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "You can just do it right there in the interaction with the operatives directly."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "Is there other shell

"What is grep?"}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So grep basically searches the input for particular patterns, regular expressions, technically, of a certain class."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And it has that same paradigm that AUC does."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "It's a pattern action thing."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "It reads through all the files and then all the lines in each file."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "But it has a single pattern, which is the regular expression you're looking for, and a single action printed if it matches."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "So in that sense, it's a much simpler version."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "And you could write grep in AUC as a one liner."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "And I use grep probably more than anything else at this point just because it's so convenient and natural."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Why do you think it's such a powerful tool, grep and AUC?"}, {"time": 2378, "text": "Why do you think operating systems like Windows, for example, don't have it?"}, {"time": 2385, "text": "You can, of course, I use, which is amazing now, there's Windows for Linux."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "So which you could basically use all the fun stuff like AUC and grep inside of Windows."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "But Windows naturally, as part of the graphical interface, the simplicity of grep, searching through a bunch of files and just popping up naturally."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Why do you think that's unique to the Linux environment?"}, {"time": 2412, "text": "It's not strictly unique, but it's certainly focused there."}, {"time": 2416,

making that graphical interface what it is."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And that's a different model of computing."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "It's a model of computing where you point and click and sort of experiment with menus."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "It's a model of computing works rather well for people who are not programmers and just want to get something done, whereas teaching something like the command line to nonprogrammers turns out to sometimes be an uphill struggle."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And so I think Microsoft probably was right in what they did."}, {"time": 2466, "text":

impossible task and give a brief history of programming languages from your perspective?"}, {"time": 2806, "text": "So I guess you could say programming languages started probably in, what, the late 40s or something like that."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "People used to program computers by basically putting in zeros and ones."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "Using something like switches on a console."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "And then, or maybe holes in paper tapes."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "So extremely tedious, awful, whatever."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "And so I think the first programming languages were relatively crude assembly languages, where people would basically write a program that would convert mnemonics like add ADD into whatever the bit pattern was that corresponded to an ADD instruction."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "And they would do the clerical work of figuring out where things were."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "So you could put a name on a location in a program, and the assembler would figure out where that corresponded to when the thing was all put together and dropped into memory."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "And early on, and this would be the late 40s and very early 50s, there were assemblers written for the various machines that people used."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "You may have seen in the paper just a couple of days ago, Tony Berker died."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "He did this thing in Manchester called AutoCode, a language which I knew only by name."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But it sounds like it was a flavor of assembly language, sort of a little higher in some ways."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And it replaced a language that Alan Turing wrote, which you put in zeros and ones."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "But you put it in backwards order, because that was a hardware word."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "Very strange."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "Backwards."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "So assembly languages, let's call that the early 1950s."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "And so every different flavor of computer has its own assembly language."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So the EDSAC had its, and the Manchester had its, and the IBM whatever, 790 or 704, or whatever had its, and so on."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So everybody had their own assembly language."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And assembly languages have a few commands, additions, subtraction, then branching of some kind, if then type of situation."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "Right, they have exactly, in their simplest form at least, one instruction per, or one assembly language instruction per instruction in the machine's repertoire."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And so you have to know the machine intimately to be able to write programs in it."}, {"time":

bad."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "And so what happened in the late 50s was people realized you could play this game again, and you could move up a level in writing or creating languages that were closer to the way that real people might think about how to write code."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "And there were, I guess, arguably three or four at that time period."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "There was

was in there somewhere."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "I think it's just a little later."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "And so all of those moved the level up, and so they were closer to what you and I might think of as we were trying to write a program."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "And they were focused on different domains, FORTRAN for formula translation, engineering computations, let's say COBOL for business, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "And still used today, at least FORTRAN probably."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "Oh, yeah, COBOL, too."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "But the deal was that once you moved up that level, then you, let's call it FORTRAN, you had a language that was not tied to a particular kind of hardware, because a different compiler would compile for a different kind of hardware."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "And that meant two things."}, {"time": 3030, "text": "It meant you only had to write the program once, which is very important."}, {"time": 3033, "text":

it for you."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "It might not be as good as you'd get with a real programmer, but it was pretty good."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "And so it democratized and made much more broadly available the ability to write code."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "So it puts the power of programming into the hands of people like you."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "Yeah, anybody who is willing to invest some time in learning a programming language and is not then tied to a particular kind of computer."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "And then in the 70s, you get system programming languages, of which C is the survivor."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "And what does system programming language mean?"}, {"time": 3071, "text": "Programs that, programming languages that would take on the kinds of things that were necessary to write so called system programs."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Things like text editors, or assemblers, or compilers, or operating systems themselves."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "Those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "And Fortran."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "They have to be feature rich."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "They have to be able to do a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "A lot of memory management, access processes, and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "It's a different flavor of what they're doing."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "They're much more in touch with the actual machine, but in a positive way."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "That is, you can talk about memory in a more controlled way."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "You can talk about the different data types that the machine supports, and more ways to structure and organize data."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "And so the system programming languages, there was a lot of effort in that in the, call it the late 60s, early 70s."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "C is, I think, the only real survivor of that."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And then what happens after that?"}, {"time": 3129, "text": "You get things like object oriented programming languages."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "Because as you write programs in a language like C, at some point scale gets to you."}, {"time": 3136, "text": "And it's too hard to keep track of the pieces."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "And there's no guardrails, or training wheels, or something like that to prevent you from doing bad things."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "So C++ comes out of that tradition."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And then it took off from there."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "I mean, there's also a parallel, slightly parallel track with a little bit of functional stuff with Lisp and so on."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "But I guess from that point, it's just an explosion of languages."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "There's the Java story."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "There's the JavaScript."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "There's all the stuff that the cool kids these days are doing with Rust and all that."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "So what's to you?"}, {"time": 3170, "text": "You wrote a book, C Programming Language."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And C is probably one of the most important languages in the history of programming languages, if you kind of look at impact."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "What do you think is the most elegant or powerful part of C?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Why did it survive?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Why did it have such a long lasting impact?"}, {"time": 3191, "text": "I think it found a sweet spot of expressiveness, so that you could rewrite things in a pretty natural way, and efficiency, which was particularly important when computers were not nearly as powerful as they are today."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "You've got to put yourself back 50 years, almost, in terms of what computers could do."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "And that's roughly four or five generations, decades of Moore's law, right?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So expressiveness and efficiency and, I don't know, perhaps the environment that it came with as well, which was Unix."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So it meant if you wrote a program, it could be used on all those computers that ran Unix."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And that was all of those computers, because they were all written in C. And that was Unix, the operating system itself, was portable, as were all the tools."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So it all worked together, again, in one of these things where things fit on each other in a positive cycle."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "What did it take to write sort of a definitive book, probably definitive book on all of program, like it's more definitive to a particular language than any other book on any other language, and did two really powerful things, which is popularized the language, at least from my perspective, maybe you can correct me."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "And second is created a standard of how, you know, how this language is supposed to be used and applied."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "So what did it take?"}, {"time": 3274, "text": "Did you have those kinds of ambitions in mind when working on that?"}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Is this some kind of joke?"}, {"time": 3282, "text": "So it's an accident of timing, skill, and just luck?"}, {"time": 3288, "text": "A lot of it is, clearly."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "Timing was good."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "Now, Dennis and I wrote the book in 1977."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Dennis Ritchie."},

3303, "text": "And C was also available on other kinds of computers that had nothing to do with Unix."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "And so the language had some potential."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "And there were no other books on C, and Bell Labs was really the only source for it."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "And Dennis, of course, was authoritative because it was his language."}, {"time": 3323,

"text": "So I twisted his arm until he agreed to write a book, and then we wrote a book."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And the virtue or advantage, at least, I guess, of going first is that then other people have to follow you if they're gonna do anything."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And I think it worked well because Dennis was a superb writer."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "I mean, he really, really did."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "And the reference manual in that book is his, period."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "I had nothing to do with that at all."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "So just crystal clear prose and very, very well expressed."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And then he and I, I wrote most of the expository material."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "And then he and I sort of did the usual ping ponging back and forth, refining it."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "But I spent a lot of time trying to find examples that would sort of hang together and that would tell people what they might need to know at about the right time that they should be thinking about needing it."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "And I'm not sure it completely succeeded, but it mostly worked out fairly well."}, {"time": 3388,

World."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "So what, and that's a representative example."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "So what do you find powerful about examples?"}, {"time": 3417, "text": "I think a good example will tell you how to do something and it will be representative of, you might not want to do exactly that, but you will want to do something that's at least in that same general vein."},

again."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "There's a grab."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And so that kind of find things that are representative of what people want to do and spell those out so that they can then take those and see the core parts and modify them to their taste."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And I think that a lot of programming books that, I don't look at programming books a tremendous amount these days, but when I do, a lot of them don't do that."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "They don't give you examples that are both realistic and something you might want to do."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Some of them are pure syntax."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Here's how you add three numbers."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Well, come on, I could figure that out."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Tell me how I would get those three numbers into the computer and how we would do something useful with them and then how I put them back out again, neatly formatted."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And especially if you follow that example, there is something magical of doing something that feels useful."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And I think it's the attempt, and it's absolutely not perfect, but the attempt in all cases was to get something that was going to be either directly useful or would be very representative of useful things that a programmer might want to do."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "But within that vein of fundamentally text processing, reading text, doing something, writing text."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So you've also written a book on Go language."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "I have to admit, so I worked at Google for a while and I've never used Go."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "Well, you missed something."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "Well, I know I missed something for sure."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "I mean, so Go and Rust are two languages that I hear very, spoken very highly of and I wish I would like to, well, there's a lot of them."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "There's Julia, there's all these incredible modern languages."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "But if you can comment before, or maybe comment on what do you find, where does Go sit in this broad spectrum of languages?"},

the people."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "Yeah, the people."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "And then with this very, very useful influence from the European school in particular, the Claude Speer influence through Robert Griesemer, who was, I guess, a second generation down student at ETH."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "And so that's an interesting combination of things."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And so some ways, Go captures the good parts of C, it looks sort of like C, it's sometimes characterized as C for the 21st century."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "On the surface, it looks very, very much like C. But at the same time, it has some interesting data structuring capabilities."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And then I think the part that I would say is particularly useful, and again, I'm not a Go expert."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "In spite of coauthoring the book, about 90% of the work was done by Alan Donovan, my coauthor, who is a Go expert."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "But Go provides a very nice model of concurrency."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "It's basically the cooperating, communicating sequential processes that Tony Hoare set forth, jeez, I don't know, 40 plus years ago."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "And Go routines are, to my mind, a very natural way to talk about parallel computation."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "And in the few experiments I've done with them, they're easy to write, and typically it's gonna work, and very efficient as well."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "So I think that's one place where Go stands out, that that model of parallel computation is very, very easy and nice to work with."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "Just to comment on that, do you think C foresaw, or the early Unix days foresaw threads and massively parallel computation?"}, {"time": 3683, "text": "I would guess not really."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "I mean, maybe it was seen, but not at the level where it was something you had to do anything about."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "For a long time, processors got faster, and then processors stopped getting faster because of things like power consumption and heat generation."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "And so what happened instead was that instead of processors getting faster, there started to be more of them."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And that's where that parallel thread stuff comes in."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "So if you can comment on all the other languages, is it break your heart that you'll never get to explore them?"}, {"time": 3721, "text": "How do you feel about the full variety?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "It's not break my heart, but I would love to be able to try more of these languages."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "The closest I've come is in a class that I often teach in the spring here."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "It's a programming class, and I often give, I have one sort of small example that I will write in as many languages as I possibly can."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "I've got it in 20 languages."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "At this point, and that's so I do a minimal experiment with a language just to say, okay, I have this trivial task, which I understand the task, and it takes 15 lines in awk, and not much more in a variety of other languages."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So how big is it?"}, {"time": 3763, "text": "And what pain did I go through to learn how to do it?"}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And that's like anecdotal, right?"}, {"time": 3772, "text": "It's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very narrowly focused."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "I think data, I like that term."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So yeah, but still, it's a little sample, because you get to, I think the hardest step of the programming language is probably the first step, right, so there you're taking the first step."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "Yeah, and so my experience with some languages is very positive, like Lua, a scripting language I had never used, and I took my little program."}, {"time": 3799,

line."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "So think of it as just kind of the flow of process in a browser or something."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "So it's a very short program."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "And in Lua, I downloaded Lua, and in an hour, I had it working, never having written Lua in my life, just going with online documentation."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "I did the same thing in Scala, which you can think of as a flavor of Java, equally trivial."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "I did it in Haskell."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "It took me several weeks."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "But it did run like a turtle."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And I did it in Fortran 90, and it was painful, but it worked, and I tried it in Rust, and it took me several days to get it working because the model of memory management was just a little unfamiliar to me."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "And the problem I had with Rust, and it's back to what we were just talking about, I couldn't find good, consistent documentation on Rust."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Now, this was several years ago, and I'm sure things have stabilized, but at the time, everything in the Rust world seemed to be changing rapidly, and

3877, "text": "Rust is a language I would like to get back to, but probably won't."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "I think one of the issues, you have to have something you want to do."}, {"time": 3884,

Well, let me just sort of comment on what I said."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "When I was brought up, sort of JavaScript was seen as probably like the ugliest language possible, and yet it's quite arguably, quite possibly taking over, not just the front end and the back end of the internet, but possibly in the future taking over everything, because they've now learned to make it very efficient."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "And so what do you think about this?"}, {"time": 3929, "text": "Yeah, well, I think you've captured it in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "When it first came out, JavaScript was deemed to be fairly irregular and an ugly language, and certainly in the academy, if you said you were working on JavaScript, people would ridicule you."}, {"time": 3940,

3961, "text": "Used well, I think it's a pretty good language."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "I've written a modest amount of it, and I've played with JavaScript translators and things like that."},

over the world."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "I think not, but it's certainly an important language, and worth knowing more about."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "There's, maybe to get your comment on something, which JavaScript, and actually most languages, sort of Python, such a big part of the experience of programming with those languages includes libraries, sort of using, building on top of the code that other people have built."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "I think that's probably different from the experience that we just talked about from Unix and C days, when you're building stuff from scratch."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "What do you think about this world of essentially leveraging, building up libraries on top of each other and leveraging them?"}, {"time": 4017, "text": "Yeah, no, that's a very perceptive kind of question."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "One of the reasons programming was fun in the old days was that you were really building it all yourself."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "The number of libraries you had to deal with was quite small."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "Maybe it was printf, or the standard library, or something like that, and that is not the case today."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "And if you want to do something in, you mentioned Python and JavaScript, and those are the two fine examples, you have to typically download a boatload of other stuff, and you have no idea what you're getting, absolutely nothing."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "I've been doing some playing with machine learning over the last couple of days, and geez, something doesn't work."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "Well, you pip install this, okay, and down comes another one, okay, and down comes another gazillion megabytes of something and you have no idea what it was."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "And if you're lucky, it works."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "And if it doesn't work, you have no recourse."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "There's absolutely no way you could figure out which of these thousand different packages."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "And I think it's worse in the NPM environment for JavaScript."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "I think there's less discipline, less control there."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And there's aspects of not just not understanding how it works, but there's security issues, there's robustness issues, so you don't wanna run a nuclear power plant using JavaScript, essentially."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "So speaking to the variety of languages, do you think that variety is good, or do you hope, think that over time, we should converge towards one, two, three programming languages?"}, {"time": 4108, "text": "You mentioned to the Bell Lab days when people could sort of, the community of it, and the more languages you have, the more you separate the communities."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "There's the Ruby community, there's the Python community, there's C++ community."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Do you hope that they'll unite one day to just one or two languages?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "I certainly don't hope it."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "I'm not sure that that's right, because I honestly don't think there is one language that will suffice for all the programming needs of the world."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "Are there too many at this point?"}, {"time": 4136, "text": "Well, arguably."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "But I think if you look at the sort of the distribution of how they are used, there's something called a dozen languages that probably account for 95% of all programming at this point, and that doesn't seem unreasonable."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "And then there's another, well, 2,000 languages that are still in use that nobody uses, and, or at least don't use in any quantity."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "But I think new languages are a good idea in many respects, because they're often a chance to explore an idea of how language might help."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "I think that's one of the positive things about functional languages, for example."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "They're a particularly good place where people have explored ideas that at the time didn't seem feasible, but ultimately have wound up as part of mainstream languages as well."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "I mean, just go back as early as Recursion Lisp and then follow forward functions as first class citizens and pattern based languages, and gee, I don't know, closures, and just on and on and on."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "Lambda's interesting ideas that showed up first in, let's call it broadly, the functional programming community, and then find their way into mainstream languages."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "Yeah, it's a playground for rebels."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Yeah, exactly, and so I think the languages in the playground themselves are probably not going to be the mainstream, at least for some while, but the ideas that come from there are invaluable."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "So let's go to something that, when I found out recently, so I've known that you've done a million things, but one of the things I wasn't aware of, that you had a role in Ample, and before you interrupt me by minimizing your role in it."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Ample is for minimizing functions."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Yeah, minimizing functions, right, exactly."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "Can I just say that the elegance and abstraction power of Ample is incredible, when I first came to it about 10 years ago or so."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "Can you describe what is the Ample language?"}, {"time": 4302, "text": "And it specifies, so there's objective function constraints and variables that become separate from the data it operates on."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "So that kind of separation allows you to, put on different hats, one put the hat of an optimization person and then put another hat of a data person and dance back and forth, and also separate the actual solvers, the optimization systems that do the solving."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "Then you can have other people come to the table and then build their solvers, whether it's linear or nonlinear, convex, nonconvex, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "So what is the, to you as, maybe you can comment how you got into that world and what is the beautiful or interesting idea to you from the world of optimization?"}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So I preface it by saying I'm absolutely not an expert on this and most of the important work in AMPL comes from my two partners in crime on that, Bob Forer, who was a professor in the Industrial Engineering and Management Science Department at Northwestern, and my colleague at Bell Labs, Dave Gay, who was a numerical analyst and optimization person."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So the deal is linear programming."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "Preface this by saying I don't."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "Let's stay with linear programming."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Yeah, linear programming is the simplest example of this."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "So linear programming, as it's taught in school, is that you have a big matrix, which is always called A, and you say AX is less than or equal to B."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "So B is a set of constraints, X is the decision variables, and A is how the decision variables are combined to set up the various constraints."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So A is a matrix and X and B are vectors."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "And then there's an objective function, which is just a sum of a bunch of Xs and some coefficients on them, and that's the thing you want to optimize."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "The problem is that in the real world, that matrix A is a very, very, very intricate, very large and very sparse matrix where the various components of the model are distributed among the coefficients in a way that is totally unobvious to anybody."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "And so what you need is some way to express the original model, which you and I would write, you know, we'd write mathematics on the board, and the sum of this is greater than the sum of that kind of thing."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "So you need a language to write those kinds of constraints."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "And Bob Forer, for a long time, had been interested in modeling languages, languages that made it possible to do this."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "There was a modeling language around called GAMS, the General Algebraic Modeling System, but it looked very much like Fortran."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "It was kind of clunky."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And so we talked about the design of the language."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "I don't remember any of the details of this now, but it's kind of an obvious thing."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "You're just writing out mathematical expressions in a Fortran like, sorry, an algebraic but textual like language."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And I wrote the first version of this Ample program, my first C++ program, and."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "It's written in C++?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "And so I did that fairly quickly."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "We wrote, it was, you know, 3,000 lines or something, so it wasn't very big, but it sort of showed the feasibility of it that you could actually do something that was easy for people to specify models and convert it into something that a solver could work with."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "At the same time, as you say, the model and the data are separate things."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So one model would then work with all kinds of different data in the same way that lots of programs do the same thing, but with different data."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So one of the really nice things is the specification of the models, human, just kind of like, as you say, is human readable."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Like I literally, I remember on stuff I worked, I would send it to colleagues that I'm pretty sure never programmed in their life, just to understand what the optimization problem is."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "I think, how hard is it to convert that?"}, {"time": 4578, "text": "You said there's a first prototype in C++ to convert that into something that could actually be used by the solver."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "It's not too bad, because most of the solvers have some mechanism that lets them import a model in a form."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "It might be as simple as the matrix itself in just some representation, or if you're doing things that are not linear programming, then there may be some mechanism that lets you provide things like functions to be called, or other constraints on the model."}, {"time": 4607, "text": "So all AMPL does is to generate that kind of thing, and then solver deals with all the hard work, and then when the solver comes back with numbers, AMPL converts those back into your original form, so you know how much of each thing you should be buying, or making, or shipping, or whatever."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "So we did that in 84, and I haven't had a lot to do with it since, except that we wrote a couple of versions of a book on it."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "Which is one of the greatest books ever written."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "I love that book."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "It's an excellent book."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "Bob Farrer wrote most of it, and so it's really, really well done."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "He must have been a dynamite teacher."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And typeset in LaTeX."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "No, no, no, are you kidding?"}, {"time": 4649, "text": "I remember liking the typography, so I don't know."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "We did it with DROF."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "I don't even know what that is."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "You're too young."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "Uh oh, oh boy."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "I think of DROF as a predecessor to the tech family of things."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "It's a formatter that was done at Bell Labs in this same period of the very early 70s that predates tech and things like that by five to 10 years."},

theory."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "Let me ask this crazy out there question."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "If you had to make a bet, and I had to force you to make a bet, do you think P equals NP?"},

world, are still a useful way to understand the hardness of problems?"}, {"time": 4746, "text": "I don't do that stuff."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "The last time I touched anything to do with that was before."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "Many, many years ago."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Was before it was invented."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "Because I, it's literally true."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "I did my PhD thesis on graph."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "Before Big O notation."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "Before, I did this in 1968, and I worked on graph partitioning, which is this question."},

edges that goes from one side to the other is as small as possible."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "You developed, so that problem is hard."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "Well, as it turns out, I worked with Shen Lin at Bell Labs on this, and we were never able to come up with anything that was guaranteed to give the right answer."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "We came up with heuristics that worked pretty darn well, and I peeled off some special cases for my thesis, but it was just hard."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "And that was just about the time that Steve Cook was showing that there were classes of problems that appeared to be really hard, of which graph partitioning was one."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "But this, my expertise, such as it was, totally predates that development."}, {"time": 4817,

you weren't even thinking in terms of classes."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "You were just trying to find."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "There was no such idea."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "A heuristic that kinda does the job pretty well."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "You were trying to find something that did the job, and there was nothing that you would call, let's say, a closed form or algorithmic thing

problem, except there's no constraint on the number of nodes on one side or the other of the cut."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And that means it's an easy problem, at least as I understand it."},

to choose two paths."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "So why did you, is there another alternate universe in which you pursued the Don Knuth path of algorithm design, sort of?"}, {"time": 4879, "text": "Not smart enough."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "You're infinitely modest, but so you pursued your kind of love of programming."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "I mean, when you look back to those, I mean, just looking into that world, does that just seem like a distant world of theoretical computer science?"}, {"time": 4900, "text": "Then is it fundamentally different from the world of programming?"},

about research at the end of my, I don't know, first year or something like that, I worked briefly with John Hopcroft, who is absolutely, you know, you mentioned during award winner, et cetera, a great guy, and it became crystal clear I was not cut out for this stuff, period, okay."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "And so I moved into things where I was more cut out for it, and that tended to be

Computers and Thought that was published in about that era and people were very optimistic."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And then of course it turned out that what people thought was just a few years down the pike was more than a few years down the pike."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And some parts of that are more or less now sort of under control."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "We finally do play games like Go and chess and so on better than people do, but there are others and machine translation is a lot better than it used to be, but that's, you know, 50, close to 60 years of progress and a lot of evolution in hardware and a tremendous amount more data up on which you can build systems that actually can learn from some of that data."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "And the infrastructure to support developers working together, like an open source movement, the internet, period, is also empowering."}, {"time": 5048, "text": "But what lessons do you draw from that, the opposite of winter, that optimism?"}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Well, I guess the lesson is that in the short run it's pretty easy to be too pessimistic or maybe too optimistic and in the long run you probably shouldn't be too pessimistic."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "I'm not saying that very well."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "It reminds me of this remark from Arthur Clarke, a science fiction author, who says, you know, when

serious problems in certain kinds of machine learning at least because what they're learning from is the data that we give them."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And if the data we give them has something wrong with it, then what they learn from it is probably wrong too."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "And the obvious thing is some kind of bias in the data."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "That the data has stuff

changing one regulatory region in the genome in one cell type change disease?"}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Well, that path is now long."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So if you instead look at expression, the path between genetic variation and the expression of one gene goes through many enhancer regions, and therefore it's a subtler effect at the gene level."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "But then now

lifestyle has been enormous."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So understanding COVID is important because it has impacted the wellbeing in terms of ability to have a job, ability to have an apartment, ability to go to work, ability to have a mental circle of support and all of that for millions of Americans, like huge, huge impact."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So that's one aspect of importance."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So basically mental disorders, Alzheimer's has a huge importance in the wellbeing of Americans."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "Whether or not it kills someone for many, many years, it has a huge impact."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "So the first measure of importance is just wellbeing."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Impact on the quality of life."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Impact on the quality of life, absolutely."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "The second metric, which is much easier to quantify is deaths."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "What is the number one killer?"}, {"time": 1681, "text": "The number one killer is actually heart disease."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "It is actually killing 650,000 Americans per year."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Number two is cancer with 600,000 Americans."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "Number three, far, far down the list is accidents, every single accident combined."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "So basically you read the news, accidents, like there was a huge car crash all over the news."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "But the number of deaths, number three by far, 167,000."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Core respiratory disease."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "So that's asthma, not being able to breathe and so on and so forth, 160,000 Alzheimer's number five with 120,000 and then stroke, brain aneurysms and so on and so forth, that's 147,000 diabetes and metabolic disorders, et cetera."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "That's 85,000."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "The flu is 60,000, suicide, 50,000 and then overdose, et cetera, you know, goes further down the list."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "So of course COVID has creeped up to be the number three killer this year with, you know, more than 100,000 Americans and counting."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And you know, but if you think about sort of what do we use, what are the most important diseases, you have to understand both the quality of life and the sheer number of deaths and just numbers of years lost if you wish."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "And each of these diseases you can think of as, and also including terrorist attacks and school shootings, for example, things which lead to fatalities, you can look at as problems that could be solved."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And some problems are harder to solve than others."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "I mean, that's part of the equation."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "So maybe if you look at these diseases, if you look at heart disease or cancer or Alzheimer's or just like schizophrenia and obesity, Debbie, like not necessarily things that kill you, but affect the quality of life, which problems are solvable, which aren't, which are harder to solve, which aren't."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "I love your question because he puts it in the context of a global effort rather than just the local effort."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So basically if you look at the global aspect, exercise and nutrition are two interventions that we can as a society make a much better job at."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So if you think about sort of the availability of cheap food, it's extremely high in calories."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "It's extremely detrimental for you, like a lot of processed food, et cetera."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "So if we change that equation and as a society, we made availability of healthy food much, much easier and charged a burger at McDonald's, the price that it costs on the health system, then people would actually start buying more healthy foods."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So basically that's sort of a societal intervention, if you wish."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "In the same way, increasing empathy, increasing education, increasing the social framework and support would basically lead to fewer suicides."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It would lead to fewer murders."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "It would lead to fewer deaths overall."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So that's something that we as a society can do."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "You can also think about external factors versus internal factors."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So the external factors are basically communicable diseases like COVID, like the flu, et cetera."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "And the internal factors are basically things like cancer and Alzheimer's where basically your genetics will eventually drive you there."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "And then of course, with all of these factors, every single disease has both the genetic component and environmental component."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So heart disease, huge genetic contribution, Alzheimer's, it's like 60% plus genetic."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "So I think it's like 79% heritability."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "So that basically means that genetics alone explains 79% of Alzheimer's incidents."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "And yes, there's a 21% environmental component where you could basically enrich your cognitive environment, enrich your social interactions, read more books, learn a foreign language, go running, you know, sort of have a more fulfilling life."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "All of that will actually decrease Alzheimer's, but there's a limit to how much that can impact because of the huge genetic footprint."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So this is fascinating."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "So each one of these problems have a genetic component and an environment component."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And so like when there's a genetic component, what can we do about some of these diseases?"}, {"time": 1963, "text": "And have you worked on what can you say that's in terms of problems that are solvable here or understandable?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So my group works on the genetic component, but I would argue that understanding the genetic component can have a huge impact even on the environmental component."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Because genetics gives us access to mechanism."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "And if we can alter the mechanism, if we can impact the mechanism, we can perhaps counteract some of the environmental components."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "So understanding the biological mechanisms leading to disease is extremely important in being able to intervene."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "But when you can intervene and what, you know, the analogy that I like to give is for example, for obesity, you know, think of it as a giant bathtub of fat."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "There's basically fat coming in from your diet and there's fat coming out from your exercise."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "So that's an in out equation and that's the equation that everybody's focusing on."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "But your metabolism impacts that, you know, bathtub."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "Basically your metabolism controls the rate at which you're burning energy."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "It controls the rate at which you're storing energy."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "And it also teaches you about the various valves that control the input and the output equation."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "So if we can learn from the genetics, the valves, we can then manipulate those valves."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "And even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fat and getting a little that out, you can just poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat out."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "So we're not just passive observers of our genetics."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "The more we understand, the more we can come up with actual treatments."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And I think that's an important aspect to realize when people are thinking about strong effect versus weak effect variants."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So some variants have strong effects."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "We talked about these Mendelian disorders where a single gene has a sufficiently large effect, penetrance, expressivity, and so on and so forth, that basically you can trace it in families with cases and not cases, cases, not cases, and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "But so these are the genes that everybody says, oh, that's the genes we should go after because that's a strong effect gene."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "I like to think about it slightly differently."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "These are the genes where genetic impacts that have a strong effect were tolerated because every single time we have a genetic association with disease, it depends on two things."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "Number one, the obvious one, whether the gene has an impact on the disease."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Number two, the more subtle one is whether there is genetic variation standing and circulating and segregating in the human population that impacts that gene."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them, even a tiny little amount, that person's dead."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "So those genes don't have variation."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "You're not going to find a genetic association if you don't have variation."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "That doesn't mean that the gene has no role."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "It simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "So that's actually a strong signal when there's no variation."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "That's so fascinating."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Genes that have very little variation are hugely important."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "You can actually rank the importance of genes based on how little variation they have."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And those genes that have very little variation but no association with disease, that's a very good metric to say, oh, that's probably a developmental gene because we're not good at measuring those phenotypes."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So it's genes that you can tell evolution has excluded mutations from, but yet we can't see them associated with anything that we can measure nowadays."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "It's probably early embryonic lethal."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "What are all the words you just said?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "Early embryonic what?"}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Lethal."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Meaning?"}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Meaning that that embryo will die."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "There's a bunch of stuff that is required for a stable functional organism across the board for an entire species, I guess."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "If you look at sperm, it expresses thousands of proteins."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Does sperm actually need thousands of proteins?"}, {"time": 2221, "text": "No, but it's probably just testing them."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So my speculation is that misfolding of these proteins is an early test for failure."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So that out of the millions of sperm that are possible, you select the subset that are just not grossly misfolding thousands of proteins."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "So it's kind of an assert that this is folded correctly."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "This just because if this little thing about the folding of a protein isn't correct, that probably means somewhere down the line, there's a bigger issue."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "So fail fast."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "So basically if you look at the mammalian investment in a newborn, that investment is enormous in terms of resources."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "So mammals have basically evolved mechanisms for fail fast."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "Where basically in those early months of development, I mean it's horrendous of course at the personal level when you lose your future child, but in some ways there's so little hope for that child to develop and sort of make it through the remaining months that sort of fail fast is probably a good evolutionary principle for mammals."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "And of course humans have a lot of medical resources that you can sort of give those children a chance and we have so much more success in sort of giving folks who have these strong carrier mutations a chance, but if they're not even making it through the first three months, we're not going to see them."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "So that's why when we say what are the most important genes to focus on, the ones that have a strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weak effect mutation, well the jury might be out because the ones that have a strong effect mutation are basically not mattering as much."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "The ones that only have weak effect mutations by understanding through genetics that they have a weak effect mutation and understanding that they have a causal role on the disease, we can then say, okay, great, evolution has only tolerated a 2% change in that gene."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "Pharmaceutically I can go in and induce a 70% change in that gene and maybe I will poke another hole at the bathtub that was not easy to control in many of the other sort of strong effect genetic variants."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "So there's this beautiful map of across the population of things that you're saying strong and weak effects, so stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff with little mutations with no mutations and you have this map and it lays out the puzzle."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "So when I say strong effect, I mean at the level of individual mutations."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So basically genes where, so you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Remember how I was sort of painting that map earlier from genetics all the way to phenotype."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "That gene can have a strong effect on the disease, but the genetic variant might have a weak effect on the gene."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So basically when you ask what is the effect of that genetic variant on the disease, it could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a lot and then the gene impacts the disease by a little, or it could be that the genetic variants impacts the gene by a little and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "So what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot, but genetics gives us the full equation and what I would argue is if we couple the genetics with expression variation to basically ask what genes change by a lot and which genes correlate with disease by a lot, even if the genetic variants change them by a little, then those are the best places to intervene."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Those are the best places where pharmaceutical, if I have even a modest effect, I will have a strong effect on the disease, whereas those genetic variants that have a huge effect on the disease, I might not be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all kinds of other things."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "So that's what we're looking at."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "What have we been able to find in terms of which disease could be helped?"}, {"time": 2491, "text": "Again, don't get me started."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "We have found so much."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "Our understanding of disease has changed so dramatically with genetics."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I mean places that we had no idea would be involved."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "So one of the worst things about my genome is that I have a genetic predisposition to age related macular degeneration, AMD."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "So it's a form of blindness that causes you to lose the central part of your vision progressively as you grow older."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "My increased risk is fairly small."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "I have an 8% chance."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "You only have a 6% chance."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "I'm an average."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "By the way, when you say my, you mean literally yours."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "You know this about you."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "I know this about me."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "Which is kind of, I mean philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thing to live with."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "Maybe that's, so we agreed to talk again by the way for the listeners to where we're going to try to focus on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "But it's interesting to think about the more you're able to know about yourself from the genetic information in terms of the diseases, how that changes your own view of life."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "So there's a lot of impact there and there's something called genetics exceptionalism, which basically thinks of genetics as something very, very different than everything else as a type of determinism."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "And you know, let's talk about that next time."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "That's a good preview."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "So let's go back to AMD."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "So basically with AMD, we have no idea what causes AMD."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "You know, it was, it was a mystery until the genetics were worked out."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "And now the fact that I know that I have a predisposition allows me to sort of make some life choices, number one, but number two, the genes that lead to that predisposition give us insights as to how does it actually work."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "And that's a place where genetics gave us something totally unexpected."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "So there's a complement pathway, which is an immune function pathway that was in, you know, most of the loci associated with AMD."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "And that basically told us that, wow, there's an immune basis to this eye disorder that people had just not expected before."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "If you look at complement, it was recently also implicated in schizophrenia."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "And there's a type of microglia that is involved in synaptic pruning."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So synapses are the connections between neurons."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "And in this whole use it or lose it view of mental cognition and other capabilities, you basically have microglia, which are immune cells that are sort of constantly traversing your brain and then pruning neuronal connections, pruning synaptic connections that are not utilized."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "So in schizophrenia, there's thought to be a change in the pruning that basically if you don't prune your synapses the right way, you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "This is something that was completely unexpected for schizophrenia."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Of course, we knew it has to do with neurons, but the role of the complement complex, which is also implicated in AMD, which is now also implicated in schizophrenia, was a huge surprise."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "What's the complement complex?"}, {"time": 2708, "text": "So it's basically a set of genes, the complement genes that are basically having various immune roles."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "And as I was saying earlier, our immune system has been coopted for many different roles across the body."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "So they actually play many diverse roles."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "And somehow the immune system is connected to the synaptic pruning process, the process."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "So the prune cells were coopted to prune synapses."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "How did you figure this out?"}, {"time": 2735, "text": "How does one go about figuring this intricate connection, like pipeline of connections out?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Let me give you another example."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "So Alzheimer's disease, the first place that you would expect it to act is obviously the brain."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "So we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome, the largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been built across 127 different tissues and samples with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in hundreds of donors."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "So what we've basically learned through that is that you basically can map what are the active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And then we connected these gene regulatory active maps of basically what regions of the human genome are turning on in every one of different tissues."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "We then can go back and say, where are all of the genetic loci that are associated with disease?"}, {"time": 2799, "text": "This is something that my group, I think was the first to do back in 2010 in this Ernst Nature Biotech paper, but basically we were for the first time able to show that specific chromatin states, specific epigenomic states, in that case enhancers, were in fact enriched in disease associated variants."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "We pushed that further in the Ernst Nature paper a year later."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "And then in this roadmap epigenomics paper a few years after that, but basically that matrix that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could see what genetic traits have genetic variants that are enriched in what tissues in the body."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "And a lot of that map made complete sense."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "If you looked at a diversity of immune traits like allergies and type one diabetes and so on and so forth, you basically could see that they were enriching, that the genetic variants associated with those traits were enriched in enhancers in these gene regulatory elements active in T cells and B cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "So that basically gave us a confirmation in many ways that those immune traits were indeed enriching immune cells."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "If you looked at type two diabetes, you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample and it was pancreatic islets."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "And we know that type two diabetes sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin in the beta cells of pancreatic islets."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And that sort of was spot on, super precise."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "If you looked at blood pressure, where would you expect blood pressure to occur?"}, {"time": 2905, "text": "You know, I don't know, maybe in your metabolism and ways that you process coffee or something like that."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Maybe in your brain, the way that you stress out and increases your blood pressure, et cetera."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So the blood pressure localized specifically in the left ventricle of the heart."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "So the enhancers of the left ventricle in the heart contained a lot of genetic variants associated with blood pressure."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "If you look at height, we found an enrichment specifically in embryonic stem cell enhancers."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So the genetic variants predisposing you to be taller or shorter are in fact acting in developmental stem cells, makes complete sense."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "If you looked at inflammatory bowel disease, you basically found inflammatory, which is immune, and also bowel disease, which is digestive."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And indeed we saw a double enrichment both in the immune cells and in the digestive cells."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "So that basically told us that this is acting in both components."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "There's an immune component to inflammatory bowel disease and there's a digestive component."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "And the big surprise was for Alzheimer's."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "We had seven different brain samples."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "We found zero enrichment in the brain samples for genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "And this is mind boggling."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "Our brains were literally hurting."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "What is going on?"}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And what is going on is that the brain samples are primarily neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes in terms of the cell types that make them up."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "So that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's were probably not acting in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or neurons."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So what could they be acting in?"}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Well, the fourth major cell type is actually microglia."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "Microglia are resident immune cells in your brain."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "They immune."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "They are CD14 plus, which is this sort of cell surface markers of those cells."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "So they're CD14 plus cells, just like macrophages that are circulating in your blood."}, {"time": 3030, "text": "The microglia are resident monocytes that are basically sitting in your brain."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "They're tissue specific monocytes."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "And every one of your tissues, like your fat, for example, has a lot of macrophages that are resident."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And the M1 versus M2 macrophage ratio has a huge role to play in obesity."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "And so basically, again, these immune cells are everywhere, but basically what we found through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likely underlie different disorders, we found that Alzheimer's was humongously enriched in microglia, but not at all in the other cell types."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "So what are we supposed to make that if you look at the tissues involved, is that simply useful for indication of propensity for disease, or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "It's very much the second."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "If you look at the way to therapeutics, you have to start somewhere."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "You're going to basically make assays that manipulate those genes and those pathways in those cell types."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So before we know the tissue of action, we don't even know where to start."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "We basically are at a loss."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "But if you know the tissue of action, and even better, if you know the pathway of action, then you can basically screen your small molecules, not for the gene, you can screen them directly for the pathway in that cell type."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "So you can basically develop a high throughput multiplexed robotic system for testing the impact of your favorite molecules that you know are safe, efficacious, and sort of hit that particular gene and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "You can basically screen those molecules against either a set of genes that act in that pathway or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "And then you can basically go into mice and do experiments and basically sort of figure out ways to manipulate these processes that allow you to then go back to humans and do a clinical trial that basically says, okay, I was able indeed to reverse these processes in mice."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "Can I do the same thing in humans?"}, {"time": 3166, "text": "So the knowledge of the tissues gives you the pathway to treatment, but that's not the only part."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "There are many additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease."}, {"time": 3177, "text":

ton of diseases from obesity to Alzheimer's, even schizophrenia, I think you mentioned."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "What is the actual methodology of figuring this out?"}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So indeed, I mentioned a lot of diseases and my lab works on a lot of different disorders."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "And the reason for that is that if you look at biology, it used to be zoology departments and botanology departments and virology departments and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And MIT was one of the first schools to basically create a biology department, like, oh, we're going to study all of life suddenly."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Why was that even a case?"}, {"time": 3231, "text": "Because the advent of DNA and the genome and the central dogma of DNA makes RNA makes protein in many ways, unified biology."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "You could suddenly study the process of transcription in viruses or in bacteria and have a huge impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammals because of this realization of these common underlying processes."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "And in the same way that DNA unified biology, genetics is unifying disease studies."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "So you used to have, I don't know, cardiovascular disease department and neurological disease department and neurodegeneration department and basically immune and cancer and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "And all of these were studied in different labs because it made sense, because basically the first step was understanding how the tissue functions and we kind of knew the tissues involved in cardiovascular disease and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "But what's happening with human genetics is that all of these walls and edifices that we had built are crumbling."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "And the reason for that is that genetics is in many ways revealing unexpected connections."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "So suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists to work on Alzheimer's."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "They were never in the room."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "They were in another building altogether."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "The same way for schizophrenia, we now have to sort of worry about all these interconnected aspects."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "For metabolic disorders, we're finding contributions from brain."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So suddenly we have to call the neurologist from the other building and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So in my view, it makes no sense anymore to basically say, oh, I'm a geneticist studying immune disorders."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "I mean, that's ridiculous because, I mean, of course in many ways you still need to sort of focus."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "But what we're doing is that we're basically saying we'll go wherever the genetics takes us."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And by building these massive resources, by working on our latest map is now 833 tissues, sort of the next generation of the epigenomics roadmap, which we're now called epimap, is 833 different tissues."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "And using those, we've basically found enrichments in 540 different disorders."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "Those enrichments are not like, oh great, you guys work on that and we'll work on this."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "They're intertwined amazingly."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "So of course there's a lot of modularity, but there's these enhancers that are sort of broadly active and these disorders that are broadly active."},

walls that were previously built across these departments."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And the polyfactorial ones were probably the previous structural departments wasn't equipped to deal with those."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "I mean, again, maybe it's a romanticized question, but you know, there's in physics, there's a theory of everything."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "Do you think it's

you have to be a specialist in every single disorder."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "And the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human genome that you need to solve schizophrenia, that fundamental circuitry is hugely important to solve Alzheimer's."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "And that same circuitry is hugely important to solve metabolic disorders."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And that same exact circuitry is hugely important for solving immune disorders and cancer and, you know, every single disease."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "So all of them have the same sub task."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "And I teach dynamic programming in my class."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "Dynamic programming is all about sort of not redoing the work."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "It's reusing the work that you do once."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "So basically for us to say, oh, great, you know, you guys in the immune building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "And then you guys in the schizophrenia building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything separately, is crazy."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "So what we need to do is come together and sort of have a circuitry group, the circuitry building that sort of tries to solve the circuitry of everything."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "And then the immune folks who will apply this knowledge to all of the disorders that are associated with immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folks will basically interacting with both the immune folks and with the neuronal folks."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And all of them will be interacting with the circuitry folks and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "So that's sort of the current structure of my group, if you wish."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "So basically what we're doing is focusing on the fundamental circuitry."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "But at the same time, we're the users of our own tools by collaborating with many other labs in every one of these disorders that we mentioned."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "We basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease,

different tissues."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "And all of them are interfacing with the circuitry."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And the reason for that is another computer science principle of eat your

the entire field."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And that's something that my group has taken on along with many other groups."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Not just treat it as a black box, but basically go and say, okay, we need a better cell type specific wiring that we now have at the tissue specific level."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "So we're focusing on that because we're understanding the needs from the disease front."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "So you have a sense of the entire pipeline, I mean, one, maybe you can indulge me."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "One nice question to ask would be, how do you, from the scientific perspective, go from knowing nothing about the disease to going, you said, to go into the entire pipeline and actually have a drug or a treatment that cures that disease?"}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So that's an enormously long path and an enormously great challenge."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "And what I'm trying to argue is that it progresses in stages of understanding rather than one gene at a time."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "The traditional view of biology was you have one postdoc working on this gene and another postdoc working on that gene, and they'll just figure out everything about that gene and that's their job."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "But we've realized how polygenic the diseases are, so we can't have one postdoc per gene anymore."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "We now have to have these cross cutting needs."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "And I'm going to describe the path to circuitry along those needs."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "And every single one of these paths, we are now doing in parallel across thousands of genes."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "So the first step is you have a genetic association, and we talked a little bit about sort of the Mendelian path and the polygenic path to that association."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "So the Mendelian path was looking through families to basically find gene regions and ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "The polygenic path is basically looking at unrelated individuals in this giant matrix of genotype by phenotype, and then finding hits where a particular variant impacts disease all the way to the end."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "And then we now have a connection, not between a gene and a disease, but between a genetic region and a disease."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "And that distinction is not understood by most people."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "So I'm going to explain it a little bit more."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "Why do we not have a connection between a gene and a disease, but we have a connection between a genetic region and a disease?"}, {"time": 3913, "text": "The reason for that is that 93% of genetic variants that are associated with disease don't impact the protein at all."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "So if you look at the human genome, there's 20,000 genes, there's 3.2 billion nucleotides."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "Only 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "The other 98.5% does not code for proteins."}, {"time": 3946, "text": "If you now look at where are the disease variants located, 93% of them fall in that outside the genes portion."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Of course, genes are enriched, but they're only enriched by a factor of three."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "That means that still 93% of genetic variants fall outside the proteins."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "Why is that difficult?"}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Why is that a problem?"}, {"time": 3969, "text": "The problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene, you don't know what gene is impacted by that variant."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "You can't just say, oh, it's near this gene, let's just connect that variant to the gene."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "And the reason for that is that the genome circuitry is very often long range."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "So you basically have that genetic variant that could sit in the intron of one gene."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "An intron is sort of the place between the exons that code for proteins."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So proteins are split up into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset of amino acids and together they're spliced together and then make the final protein."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "So that genetic variant might be sitting in an intron of a gene."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "It's transcribed with the gene, it's processed and then excised, but it might not impact this gene at all."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "It might actually impact another gene that's a million nucleotides away."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "So it's just riding along even though it has nothing to do with this nearby neighborhood."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "The strongest genetic association with obesity was discovered in this FTO gene, fat and obesity associated gene."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "So this FTO gene was studied ad nauseum."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "People did tons of experiments on it."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "They figured out that FTO is in fact RNA methylation transferase."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "It basically impacts something that we call the epitranscriptome."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Just like the genome can be modified, the transcriptome, the transcript of the genes can be modified."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "And we basically said, oh great, that means that epitranscriptomics is hugely involved in obesity because that gene FTO is clearly where the genetic locus is at."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "My group studied FTO in collaboration with a wonderful team led by Melina Klausnitzer."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "And what we found is that this FTO locus, even though it is as associated with obesity, does not implicate the FTO gene."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "The genetic variance, it's in the first intron of the FTO gene, but it controls two genes IRX3 and IRX5 that are sitting 1.2 million nucleotides away, several genes away."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "What am I supposed to feel about that because isn't that like super complicated then?"}, {"time": 4118, "text": "So the way that I was introduced at a conference a few years ago was, and here's Manolis Kellis who wrote the most depressing paper of 2015."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry was so comfortable that there was a single gene in that locus."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "Because in some loci, you basically have three dozen genes that are all sitting in the same region of association and you're like, oh gosh, which ones of those is it?"}, {"time": 4144, "text": "But even that question of which ones of those is it is making the assumption that it is one of those as opposed to some random gene just far, far away, which is what our paper showed."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "So basically what our paper showed is that you can't ignore the circuitry."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "You have to first figure out the circuitry, all of those long range interactions, how every genetic variant impacts the expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable across hundreds of individuals."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then you now have one of the building blocks, not even all of the building blocks for then going and understanding disease."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "So embrace the wholeness of the circuitry."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "So back to the question of starting knowing nothing to the disease and going to the treatment."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "So what are the next steps?"}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So you basically have to first figure out the tissue and then describe how you figure out the tissue."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "You figure out the tissue by taking all of these non coding variants that are sitting outside proteins and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "And the reason for that, you know, thankfully is that there is convergence, that the same processes are impacted in different ways by different loci."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And that's a saving grace for our field."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "The fact that if I look at hundreds of genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's, they localize in a small number of processes."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "Can you clarify why that's hopeful?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "So like they show up in the same exact way in the, in the specific set of processes."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "So basically there's a small number of biological processes that underlie, or at least that play the biggest role in every disorder."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "So in Alzheimer's you basically have, you know, maybe 10 different types of processes."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "One of them is lipid metabolism."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "One of them is immune cell function."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "One of them is neuronal energetics."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "So these are just a small number of processes, but you have multiple lesions, multiple genetic perturbations that are associated with those processes."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "So if you look at schizophrenia, it's excitatory neuron function, it's inhibitory neuron function, it's synaptic pruning, it's calcium signaling and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "So when you look at disease genetics, you have one hit here and one hit there and one hit there and one hit there, completely different parts of the genome."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "But it turns out all of those hits are calcium signaling proteins."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "You're like, aha."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "That means that calcium signaling is important."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "So those people who are focusing on one doctor at a time cannot possibly see that picture."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "You have to become a genomicist."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "You have to look at the omics, the om, the holistic picture to understand these enrichments."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "But you mentioned the convergence thing."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "The whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "So let me explain convergence."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Convergence is such a beautiful concept."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "So you basically have these four genes that are converging on calcium signaling."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "So that basically means that they are acting each in their own way, but together in the same process."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "But now in every one of these loci, you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "That's another type of convergence where dysregulation of seven different enhancers might all converge on dysregulation of that one gene, which then converges on calcium signaling."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "And in each one of those enhancers, you might have multiple genetic variants distributed across many different people."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "Everyone has their own different mutation."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "But all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And all of these enhancers are impacting that gene."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "And all of these genes are impacting this pathway."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "And all these pathways are acting in the same tissue."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And all of these tissues are converging together on the same biological process of schizophrenia."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And you're saying the saving grace is that that conversion seems to happen for a lot of these diseases."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "For all of them."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "Basically that for every single disease that we've looked at, we have found an epigenomic enrichment."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "You basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorder."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "And then you're asking for all of the enhancers active in a particular tissue."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "For 540 disorders, we've basically found that indeed there is an enrichment."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "That basically means that there is commonality."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "And from the commonality, we can just get insights."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So to explain in mathematical terms, we're basically building an empirical prior."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "We're using a Bayesian approach to basically say, great, all of these variants are equally likely in a particular locus to be important."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "So in a genetic locus, you basically have a dozen variants that are coinherited."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "Because the way that inheritance works in the human genome is through all of these recombination events during meiosis, you basically have, you know, you inherit maybe three, chromosome three, for example, in your body is inherited from four different parts."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "One part comes from your dad, another part comes from your mom, another part comes from your dad, another part comes from your mom."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "So basically, the way that it, sorry, from your mom's mom."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "So you basically have one copy that comes from your dad and one copy that comes from your mom."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "But that copy that you got from your mom is a mixture of her maternal and her paternal chromosome."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "And the copy that you got from your dad is a mixture of his maternal and his paternal chromosome."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "So these breakpoints that happen when chromosomes are lining up are basically ensuring through these crossover events, they're ensuring that every child cell during the process of meiosis, where you basically have, you know, one spermatozoid that basically couples with one ovule to basically create one egg to basically create the zygote."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "You basically have half of your genome that comes from dad and half your genome that comes from mom."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "But in order to line them up, you basically have these crossover events."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "These crossover events are basically leading to coinheritance of that entire block coming from your maternal grandmother and that entire block coming from your maternal grandfather."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "Over many generations, these crossover events don't happen randomly."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "There's a protein called PRDM9 that basically guides the double stranded breaks and then leads to these crossovers."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "And that protein has a particular preference to only a small number of hotspots of recombination, which then lead to a small number of breaks between these coinheritance patterns."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "So even though there are 6 million variants, there are 6 million loci, this variation is inherited in blocks and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants that are all associated."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "So in the case of FTO, it wasn't just one variant, it was 89 common variants that were all humongously associated with obesity."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "Which one of those is the important one?"}, {"time": 4586, "text": "Well, if you look at only one locus, you have no idea."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "But if you look at many loci, you basically say, aha, all of them are enriching in the same epigenomic map."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "In that particular case, it was mesenchymal stem cells."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "So these are the progenitor cells that give rise to your brown fat and your white fat."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "Progenitor is like the early on developmental stem cells?"}, {"time": 4614, "text": "So you start from one zygote and that's a totipotent cell type."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "It can do anything."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "You then, you know, that cell divides, divides, divides, and then every cell division is leading to specialization where you now have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal lineage and endodermal lineage that basically leads to different parts of your body."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "The ectoderm will basically give rise to your skin, ecto means outside, derm is skin."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "So ectoderm, but it also gives rise to your neurons and your whole brain."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "So that's a lot of ectoderm."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "Mesoderm gives rise to your internal organs, including the vasculature and you know, your muscle and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "So you basically have this progressive differentiation and then if you look further, further down that lineage, you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both your muscle and your bone, but also your fat."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "And if you go further down the lineage of your fat, you basically have your white fat cells."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "These are the cells that store energy."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "So when you eat a lot, but you don't exercise too much, there's an excess set of calories, excess energy."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "What do you do with those?"}, {"time": 4688, "text": "You basically create, you spend a lot of that energy to create these high energy molecules, lipids, which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "So that leads to obesity if you don't exercise and if you overeat because your body's like, oh great, I have all these calories."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "I'm going to store them."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "Ooh, more calories."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "I'm going to store them too."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "So basically the 42% of European chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fat, which was selected probably in the food scarcity periods, like basically as we were exiting Africa before and during the ice ages, there was probably a selection to those individuals who made it North to basically be able to store energy, a lot more energy."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So you basically now have this lineage that is deciding whether you want to store energy in your white fat or burn energy in your beige fat."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "It turns out that your fat is, you know, like we have such a bad view of fat."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "Fat is your best friend."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "Fat can both store all these excess lipids that would be otherwise circulating through your body and causing damage, but it can also burn calories directly."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "If you have too much energy, you can just choose to just burn some of that as heat."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "So basically when you're cold, you're burning energy to basically warm your body up and you're burning all these lipids and you're burning all these calories."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "So what we basically found is that across the board, genetic variants associated with obesity across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly in mesenchymal stem cell enhancers."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "So that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants was likely driving this whole association."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "And we ended up with this one genetic variant called RS1421085."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to be causal for the disease."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "So going back to those steps, first step is figure out the relevant tissue based on the global enrichment."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "Second step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this linkage disequilibrium in this coinherited block between these recombination hotspots, these boundaries of these inherited blocks."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "That's the second step."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "The third step is once you know that causal variant, try to figure out what is the motif that is disrupted by that causal variant."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "Basically how does it act?"}, {"time": 4854, "text": "Variants don't just disrupt elements, they disrupt the binding of specific regulators."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "So basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible like the gene regulatory word, the building block of gene regulation that is responsible for that dysregulatory event."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "And the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif and is now no longer able to bind."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "And then once you have the regulator, can you then try to figure out how to, what after it developed, how to fix it?"}, {"time": 4888, "text": "You now know how to intervene."}, {"time": 4890, "text": "You have basically a regulator, you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say, well, maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "I can perturb the regulator."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "Just to clarify, when we say perturb, like on the scale of a human life, can a human being be helped?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "I guess understanding is the first step."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "No, no, but perturbed basically means you now develop therapeutics, pharmaceutical therapeutics against that."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "Or you develop other types of intervention that affect the expression of that gene."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "What do pharmaceutical therapeutics look like when your understanding is on a genetic level?"}, {"time": 4932, "text": "Sorry if it's a dumb question."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "It's a brilliant question, but I want to save it for a little bit later when we start talking about therapeutics."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So let's talk about the first four steps."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "There's two more."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So basically the first step is figure out, I mean, the zero step, the starting point is the genetics."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "The first step after that is figure out the tissue of action."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "The second step is figuring out the nucleotide that is responsible or set of nucleotides."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "The third step is figuring out the motif and the upstream regulator, number four."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "Number five and six is what are the targets?"}, {"time": 4964, "text": "So number five is great."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Now I know the regulator."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "I know the motif."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "I know the tissue and I know the variant."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "What does it actually do?"}, {"time": 4973, "text": "So you have to now trace it to the biological process and the genes that mediate that biological process."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So knowing all of this can now allow you to find the target genes."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "By basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking at the folding of the epigenome or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant on the expression of genes."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "And we use all three."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So let me go through them."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Basically one of them is physical links."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "This is the folding of the genome onto itself."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "How do you even figure out the folding?"}, {"time": 5012, "text": "It's a little bit of a tangent, but it's a super awesome technology."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Think of the genome as again, this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two meters worth of DNA and putting it in something that's a million times smaller than two meters worth of DNA."}, {"time": 5029, "text": "That's a single cell."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "You basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically leads to the chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight, tight ways in ways, however, that are functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "So I can then go in and figure out that folding by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup, putting glue and ligating the segments that were chopped up but nearby each other, and then sequencing through these ligation events to figure out that this region of this chromosome, that region of the chromosome were near each other."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "That means they were interacting even though they were far away on the genome itself."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "So that chopping up, sequencing and reglueing is basically giving you folds of the genome that we call."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "Sorry, can you backtrack?"}, {"time": 5085, "text": "How does cutting it help you figure out which ones were close in the original folding?"}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So you have a bowl of noodles."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "And in that bowl of noodles, some noodles are near each other."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "So you throw in a bunch of glue, you basically freeze the noodles in place, throw in a cutter that chops up the noodles into little pieces."}, {"time": 5110, "text": "Now throw in some ligation enzyme that lets those pieces that were free religate near each other."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "In some cases, they religate what you had just cut, but that's very rare."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "Most of the time they will religate in whatever was proximal."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "You now have glued the red noodle that was crossing the blue noodle to each other."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "You then reverse the glue, the glue goes away and you just sequence the heck out of it."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "Most of the time you'll find red segment with, you know, red segment, but you can specifically select for ligation events that have happened that were not from the same segment by sort of marking them in a particular way and then selecting those and then you sequence and you look for red with blue matches of sort of things that were glued that were not immediate proximal to each other."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "And that reveals the linking of the blue noodle and the red noodle."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "You're with me so far?"}, {"time": 5171, "text": "So we've done these experiments."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "That's the physical."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "That's step one of the physical."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "And what the physical revealed is topologically associated domains, basically big blocks of the genome that are topologically connected together."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "The second one is the genetic links."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "It basically says across individuals that have different genetic variants, how are their genes expressed differently?"}, {"time": 5199, "text": "Remember before I was saying that the path between genetics and disease is enormous, but we can break it up to look at the path between genetics and gene expression."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "So instead of using Alzheimer's as a phenotype, I can now use expression of IRX3 as the phenotype, expression of gene A."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "And I can look at all of the humans who contain a G at that location and all the humans that contain a T at that location and basically say, wow, it turns out that the expression of each gene is higher for the T humans than for the G humans at that location."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "So that basically gives me a genetic link between a genetic variant, a locus, a region, and the expression of nearby genes."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "Good on the genetic link?"}, {"time": 5242, "text": "The third genetic link is the activity link."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "What's an activity link?"}, {"time": 5246, "text": "It basically says if I look across 833 different epigenomes, whenever this enhancer is active, this gene is active."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "That gives me an activity link between this region of the DNA and that gene."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And then the fourth one is perturbations where I can go in and blow up that region and see what are the genes that change in expression, or I can go in and over activate that region and see what genes change in expression."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "So I guess that's similar to activity?"}, {"time": 5279, "text": "So that's basically similar to activity."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "I agree, but it's causal rather than correlational."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "Again, I'm a little weird."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "No, no, you're 100% on."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "It's exactly the same as the perturbation where I go in and intervene."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "I basically take a bunch of cells."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "So you know CRISPR, right?"}, {"time": 5296, "text": "CRISPR is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "That's what George Church likes to call genome vandalism."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "So you basically are able to, you can basically take a guide RNA that you put into the CRISPR system, and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA, scan the genome, find wherever there's a match, and then cut the genome."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "So I digress, but it's a bacterial immune defense system."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses, but sometimes they win against the viruses and they chop up these viruses."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "And remember as a trophy inside their genome, they have these loci, these CRISPR loci that basically stands for clustered repeats, interspersed, et cetera."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So basically it's an interspersed repeats structure where basically you have a set of repetitive regions and then interspersed where these variable segments that were basically matching viruses."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So when this was first discovered, it was basically hypothesized that this is probably a bacterial immune system that remembers the trophies of the viruses that managed to kill."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And then the bacteria pass on, you know, they sort of do lateral transfer of DNA and they pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says, Ooh, you killed that guy."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "When that guy shows up again, I will recognize him."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "And the CRISPR system was basically evolved as a bacterial adaptive immune response to sense foreigners that should not belong and to just go and cut their genome."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "So it's an RNA guided RNA cutting enzyme or an RNA guided DNA cutting enzyme."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "So there's different systems."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "Some of them cut DNA, some of them cut RNA, but all of them remember this sort of viral attack."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "So what we have done now as a field is, you know, through the work of, you know, Jennifer Donne, Manuel Carpentier, Feng Zhang and many others is coopted that system of bacterial immune defense as a way to cut genomes."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "You basically have this guiding system that allows you to use an RNA guide to bring enzymes to cut DNA at a particular locus."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So this is like already a natural mechanism, a natural tool for cutting those useful as particular context."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "And we're like, well, we can use that thing to actually, it's a nice tool that's already in the body."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "It's not in our body."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "It's in the bacterial body."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "It was discovered by the yogurt industry."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "They were trying to make better yogurts and they were trying to make their bacteria in their yogurt cultures more resilient to viruses."},

"text": "And then it was coopted in mammalian systems that don't use anything like that as a targeting way to basically bring these DNA cutting enzymes to any locus in the genome."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Why would you want to cut DNA to do anything?"}, {"time": 5489, "text": "The reason is that our DNA has a DNA repair mechanism where if a region of the genome gets randomly cut, you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches and sort of use it by homology."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "So the reason why we're deployed is because we now have a spare copy."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "As soon as my mom's copy is deactivated, I can use my dad's copy."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "And somewhere else, if my dad's copy is deactivated, I can use my mom's copy to repair it."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So this is called homologous based repair."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So all you have to do is the cutting and you don't have to do the fixing."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "You don't have to do the fixing."}, {"time": 5526, "text": "Because it's already built in."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "But the fixing can be coopted by throwing in a bunch of homologous segments that instead of having your dad's version, have whatever other version you'd like to use."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So you then control the fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And that's how you do genome editing."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "So that's what CRISPR is."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "That's what CRISPR is."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "In popular culture, people use the term."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "I've never, wow, that's brilliant."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "So CRISPR is genome vandalism followed by a bunch of band aids that have the sequence that you'd like."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "And you could control the choices of band aids."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "And of course there's new generations of CRISPR."}, {"time": 5566, "text": "There's something that's called prime editing that was sort of very, very much in the press recently that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded break, which again is genome vandalism, you basically make a single stranded break."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "You basically just nick one of the two strands, enabling you to sort of peel off without sort of completely breaking it up and then repair it locally using a guide that is coupled to your initial RNA that took you to that location."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "Dumb question, but is CRISPR as awesome and cool as it sounds?"}, {"time": 5604, "text": "I mean, technically speaking, in terms of like as a tool for manipulating our genetics in the positive meaning of the word manipulating, or is there downsides, drawbacks in this whole context of therapeutics that we're talking about or understanding and so on?"}, {"time": 5622, "text": "So when I teach my students about CRISPR, I show them articles with the headline, genome editing tool revolutionizes biology."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "And then I show them the date of these articles and they're 2004, like five years before CRISPR was invented."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "And the reason is that they're not talking about CRISPR."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "They're talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring these cutters to the genome."},

for every location that you want to target, you need to design a particular regulator, a particular protein that will match that region well."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "There's another technology called talons, which are basically just a different way of using proteins to sort of guide these cutters to a particular location of the genome."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "These require a massive team of engineers, of biological engineers to basically design a set of amino acids that will target a particular sequence of your genome."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "The reason why CRISPR is amazingly, awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having this team of engineers design a new set of proteins for every locus that you want to target, you just type it in your computer and you just synthesize an RNA guide."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "The beauty of CRISPR is not the cutting, it's not the fixing."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "All of that was there before."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "It's the guiding, and the only thing that changes is that it makes the guiding easier by sort of just typing in the RNA sequence, which then allows the system to sort of scan the DNA to find that."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "So the coding, the engineering of the cutter is easier in terms of SP."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "That's kind of similar to the story of deep learning versus old school machine learning."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "Some of the challenging parts are automated."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "But CRISPR is just one cutting technology, and then that's part of the challenges and exciting opportunities of the field is to design different cutting technologies."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "But there's a version of that protein called dead Cas9 where the cutting part is deactivated."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "So you basically use the dead Cas9 to bring in an activator or to bring in a repressor."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "So you can now ask, is this enhancer changing that gene by taking this modified CRISPR, which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans, that you can now modify the Cas9 to be dead Cas9, and you can now further modify to bring in a regulator, and you can basically turn on or turn off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on that gene."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "So these are the four ways of linking the locus to the target gene, and that's step number five."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "Step number five is find the target gene, and step number six is what the heck does that gene do?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "You basically now go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that change, and you can basically ask, well, in this particular case, in the FTO locus, we found mesenchymal stem

this large enhancer, this master regulator."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "I like to call it OB1 for obesity one, like the strongest enhancer associated with it, and OB1 was kind of chubby as the actor."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "I don't know if you remember him."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "So you basically are using this Jedi mind trick to basically find out the location of the genome that is

with all of these other processes."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "And suddenly the moment you solve that puzzle, which is a multiyear effort by the way, a tremendous effort by Melina and many, many others."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "So this tremendous effort basically led us to recognize this circuitry."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "You went from having some 89 common variants associated in that

parallel readouts."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "So instead of perturbing one locus and then asking if I use CRISPR Cas9 on this enhancer to basically use dCas9 to turn on or turn off the enhancer, or if

6652, "text": "We don't want to spend 120,000 years doing it."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "We've basically developed this technology for massively parallel reporter assays, MPRA."}, {"time": 6667,

these sort of layers of adding one nucleotide at a time."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "You can basically just type it into your computer and order it, and you can basically order 10,000 or 100,000 of these small DNA segments at a time."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "And that's where awesome molecular biology comes in."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "You can basically take all these segments, have a common

have, you know, plasmids from floating around and bacteria use plasmids for transferring DNA."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "And that's where they put a lot of antibiotic resistance genes."}, {"time":

6832, "text": "The rest of the plasmid is the same."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "So it's, it's called an epizomal reporter assay."}, {"time": 6837, "text": "Epizome means not inside the genome."},

basically take the 450,000 elements that you've generated and you have a piece of the puzzle here, piece of the puzzle here, which is identical."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "So they're compatible with that plasmid."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "You can chop them up in the middle to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer and in the middle put the same gene again using the same piece of the

it's biotechnology."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "You basically have these arrays that add one nucleotide at a time at every spot."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "So it's printing and so you're able to, you're able to control."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "Is it super costly?"}, {"time": 6933, "text": "10,000 bucks."}, {"time": 6934, "text": "So this isn't millions."}, {"time": 6935, "text": "10,000 bucks for 10,000 experiments sounds like the right, you know."}, {"time": 6939, "text": "I mean, so that's super, that's exciting because you don't have to do one thing at a time."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "You can now use that technology, these massively parallel reporter assays to test 10,000 locations at a time."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "We've made multiple modifications to that technology."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "One was sharper MPRA, which stands for, you know, basically getting a higher resolution view by tiling these, these elements so you can see where along the region of control are they acting."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "And we made another modification called Hydra for high, you know, definition regulatory annotation or something like that, which basically allows you to test 7 million of these at a time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA."}, {"time": 6992, "text": "So instead of synthesizing, which basically has the limit of 450,000 that you can synthesize at a time, we basically said, Hey, if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome, let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "Let's take those accessible regions, put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles, and then now use those to create a much, much larger array of things that you can test."}, {"time": 7019, "text": "And then tiling all of these regions, you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides, what are the elements, how are they acting across 7 million experiments at a time."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "So basically this is all the same family of technology where you're basically using these parallel readouts of the barcodes."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "And then to do this, we used a technology called StarSeq for self transcribing reporter assays, a technology developed by Alex Stark, my former postdoc, who's now API over in Vienna."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "So we basically coupled the StarSeq, the self transcribing reporters where the enhancer can be part of the gene itself."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "So instead of having a separate barcode, that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene and it's transcribed as part of the gene."}, {"time": 7066, "text": "So you don't have to have the two separate parts."}, {"time": 7068, "text": "So you can just read them directly."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "So there's a constant improvements in this whole process."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "By the way, generating all these options, is it basically brute force?"}, {"time": 7077, "text": "How much human intuition is?"}, {"time": 7078, "text": "Oh gosh, of course it's human intuition and human creativity and incorporating all of the input data sets."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "Because again, the genome is enormous."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "3.2 billion, you don't want to test that."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "You basically use all of these tools that I've talked about already."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "You generate your top favorite 10,000 hypothesis, and then you go and test all 10,000."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "And then from what comes out, you can then go to the next step."}, {"time": 7104, "text": "So that's technology number two."}, {"time": 7105, "text": "So technology number one is robotics, automation, where you have thousands of wells and you constantly test them."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "The second technology is instead of having wells, you have these massively parallel readouts in sort of these pooled assays."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "The third technology is coupling CRISPR perturbations with these single cell RNA readouts."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "So let me make another parenthesis here to describe now single cell RNA sequencing."}, {"time": 7137, "text": "So what does single cell RNA sequencing mean?"}, {"time": 7139, "text": "So RNA sequencing is what has been traditionally used, well, traditionally the last 20 years, ever since the advent of next generation sequencing."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "So basically before RNA expression profiling was based on these microarrays."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "The next technology after that was based on sequencing."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "So you chop up your RNA and you just sequence small molecules, just like you would sequence a genome, basically reverse transcribe the small RNAs into DNA, and you sequence that DNA in order to get the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the expression level of every gene in the genome."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "You now have RNA sequencing."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "How do you go to single cell RNA sequencing?"}, {"time": 7182, "text": "That technology also went through stages of evolution."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "The first was microfluidics."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "You basically had these, or even chambers, you basically had these ways of isolating individual cells, putting them into a well for every one of these cells."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "So you have 384 well plates and you now do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression of 384 cells."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "That sounds amazing and it was amazing, but we want to do a million cells."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "How do you go from these wells to a million cells?"}, {"time": 7215, "text": "So what the next technology was after that is instead of using a well for every reaction, you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "So you use micro droplets as reaction chambers to basically amplify RNA."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "So here's the idea."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "You basically have microfluidics where you basically have every single cell coming down one tube in your microfluidics and you have little bubbles getting created in the other way with specific primers that mark every cell with its own barcode."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "You basically couple the two and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell and tons of markers for that cell."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "You now mark up all of the RNA for that one cell with the same exact barcode and you then lyse all of the droplets and you sequence the heck out of that and you have for every RNA molecule, a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "That is such good engineering, microfluidics and using some kind of primer to put a label on the thing."}, {"time": 7281, "text": "I mean, you're making it sound easy."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "I assume it's beautiful, but it's gorgeous."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So there's the next generation."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "So that's the second generation."}, {"time": 7291, "text": "Next generation is forget the microfluidics altogether."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "Just use big bottles."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "How can you possibly do that with big bottles?"}, {"time": 7299, "text": "You dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain cells that are very long and sticky so you can't do that."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "If you have blood cells or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei, you can basically dissociate let's say a million cells."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "You now want to add a unique barcode, a unique barcode in each one of a million cells using only big bottles."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "How can you possibly do that?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "Sounds crazy, but here's the idea."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "You use a hundred of these bottles, you randomly shuffle all your million cells and you throw them into those hundred bottles randomly, completely randomly."}, {"time": 7337, "text": "You add one barcode out of a hundred to every one of the cells."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "You then you now take them all out."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "You shuffle them again and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But now in a different randomization and you add a second barcode."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "So every cell now has two barcodes."}, {"time": 7356, "text": "You take them out again, you shuffle them and you throw them back in."}, {"time": 7360, "text": "Another third barcode is adding randomly from the same hundred barcodes."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "You've now labeled every cell probabilistically based on the unique path that he took of which of a hundred bottles did he go for the first time, which of a hundred bottles the second time and which of a hundred bottles the third time."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "A hundred times a hundred times a hundred is a million unique barcodes in every single one of these cells without ever using microfluidics."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "Very clever."}, {"time": 7391, "text": "From a computer science perspective, that's very clever."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "So you now have the single cell sequence technology."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "You can use the wells, you can use the bubbles or you can use the bottles and you have way The bubbles still sound pretty damn cool."}, {"time": 7403, "text": "The bubbles are awesome."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "And that's basically the main technology that we're using."}, {"time": 7406, "text": "So the bubbles is the main technology."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So there are kits now that companies just sell to basically carry out single cell RNA sequencing that you can basically for $2,000, you can basically get 10,000 cells from one sample."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "And for every one of those cells, you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes."}, {"time": 7429, "text": "And you know, of course the data for any one cell is noisy, but being computer scientists, we can aggregate the data from all of the cells together across thousands of individuals together to basically make very robust inferences."}, {"time": 7443, "text": "So the third technology is basically single cell RNA sequencing that allows you to now start asking not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variant, but what is the expression difference of that one genetic variant across every single subtype of brain cell?"}, {"time": 7461, "text": "How is the variance changing?"}, {"time": 7464, "text": "You can't just, you know, with a brain sample, you can just ask about the mean, what is the average expression?"}, {"time": 7470, "text": "If I instead have 3000 cells that are neurons, I can ask not just what is the neuronal expression."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "I can say for layer five excitatory neurons of which I have, I don't know, 300 cells, what is the variance that this genetic variant has?"}, {"time": 7488, "text": "So suddenly it's amazingly more powerful."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "I can basically start asking about this middle layer of gene expression at unprecedented levels."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "So when you look at the average, it washes out some potentially important signal that corresponds to ultimately the disease."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "So that, I can do that at the RNA level, but I can also do that at the DNA level for the epigenome."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "So remember how before I was telling you about all this technology that we're using to probe the epigenome, one of them is DNA accessibility."}, {"time": 7518, "text": "So what we're doing in my lab is that from the same dissociation of say a brain sample where you now have all these tens of thousands of cells floating around, you basically take half of them to do RNA profiling and the other half to do epigenome profiling, both at the single cell level."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "So that allows you to now figure out what are the millions of DNA enhancers that are accessible in every one of tens of thousands of cells."}, {"time": 7545, "text": "And computationally, we can now take the RNA and the DNA readouts and group them together to basically figure out how is every enhancer related to every gene."}, {"time": 7557, "text": "And remember these sort of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples?"}, {"time": 7561, "text": "833 is awesome, don't get me wrong, but 10 million is way more awesome."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "So we can now look at correlated activity across 2.3 million enhancers and 20,000 genes in each of millions of cells to basically start piecing together the regulatory circuitry of every single type of neuron, every single type of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglial cell inside the brains of 1,500 individuals that we sample across multiple different brain regions across both DNA and RNA."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "So that's the data set that my team generated last year alone."}, {"time": 7599, "text": "So in one year, we basically generated 10 million cells from human brain across a dozen different disorders, across schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, ALS, Huntington's disease, post traumatic stress disorder, autism, bipolar disorder, healthy aging, et cetera."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "So it's possible that even just within that data set lie a lot of keys to understanding these diseases and then be able to like directly leads to then treatment."}, {"time": 7640, "text": "So basically we are now motivating."}, {"time": 7642, "text": "So our computational team is in heaven right now and we're looking for people."}, {"time": 7645, "text": "I mean, if you have super smart."}, {"time": 7649, "text": "So this is a very interesting kind of side question."}, {"time": 7653, "text": "How much of this is biology?"}, {"time": 7654, "text": "How much of this is computation?"}, {"time": 7656, "text": "So you're the head of the computational biology group, but how much of, should you be comfortable with biology to be able to solve some of these problems?"}, {"time": 7668, "text": "If you just find, if you put several of the hats you were on fundamentally, are you thinking like a computer scientist here?"}, {"time": 7677, "text": "This is the only way."}, {"time": 7679, "text": "As I

regions is another sort of major, major insight."}, {"time": 8384, "text": "Often one would think that, oh, astrocytes are astrocytes no matter where they are."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "But no, there's incredible region specific differences in the expression patterns of all of the major brain cell types across different brain regions."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "So basically there's the neocortical regions that are sort of the recent innovation that makes us so different from all other species."}, {"time": 8403, "text": "There's the sort of reptilian brain sort of regions that are sort of much more very extremely distinct."}, {"time": 8411, "text": "There's the cerebellum."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "Each of those basically is associated in a different way with disease."},

Alzheimer's, it basically starts in this small region called the entorhinal cortex and then it spreads through the brain and through the hippocampus and ultimately affecting the neocortex."}, {"time": 8439, "text": "And with every brain region that it hits, it basically has a different impact on the cognitive and memory aspects, orientation, short term memory, long term memory, et cetera, which is dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals go through."}, {"time": 8458, "text": "So what we're doing now is creating these computational models for ordering the cells and the regions and the individuals according to their ability to predict Alzheimer's disease."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "So we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to now create a temporal time course that tells us when every gene turns on along this pathology progression and then trace that across regions and pathological measures that are region specific, but also cognitive measures and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 8490, "text": "So that allows us to now sort of for the first time, look at can we actually do early intervention for Alzheimer's where we know that the disease starts manifesting for 10 years before you actually have your first cognitive loss."}, {"time": 8504, "text": "Can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics, new prognostics, new biomarkers for this sort of early intervention in Alzheimer's?"}, {"time": 8514, "text": "The other aspect that we're looking at is mosaicism."}, {"time": 8517, "text": "We talked about the common variants and the rare variants, but in addition to those rare variants as your initial cell that forms the zygote divides and divides and divides, with every cell division there are additional mutations that are happening."}, {"time": 8532, "text": "So what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic of multiple different types of genetic underpinnings."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "Some cells contain a mutation that other cells don't have."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "So every human has the common variants that all of us carry to some degree, the rare variants that your immediate tree of the human species carries, and then there's the somatic variant, which is the tree that happened after the zygote that sort of forms your own body."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "So these somatic alterations is something that has been previously inaccessible to study in human postmortem samples."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "But right now with the advent of single cell RNA sequencing, in this particular case, we're using the well based sequencing, which is much more expensive, but gives you a lot richer information about each of those transcripts."}, {"time": 8584, "text": "So we're using now that richer information to infer mutations that have happened in each of the thousands of genes that sort of are active in these cells, and then understand how the genome relates to the function, this genotype phenotype relationship that we usually build in GWAS between in genome wide association studies between genetic variation and disease."}, {"time": 8611, "text": "We're now building that at the cell level, where for every cell, we can relate the unique specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of that cell, and the predicted function using these predictive models that I mentioned before on this regulation for cognition for pathology in Alzheimer's at the cell level."}, {"time": 8631, "text": "And what we're finding is that the genes that are altered and the genetic regions that are altered in common variants versus rare variants versus somatic variants are actually very different from each other."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "The somatic variants are pointing to neuronal energetics and oligodendrocyte functions that are not visible in the genetic legions that you find for the common variants, probably because they have too strong of an effect that evolution is just not tolerating them on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum."}, {"time": 8660, "text": "So the somatic one, that's the variation that happens after the zygote, after you individual."}, {"time": 8666, "text": "I mean, this is a dumb question, but there's mutation and variation, I guess that happens there."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "And you're saying that they're through this, if we focus in on individual cells, we're able to detect the story that's interesting there, and that might be a very unique kind of important variability that arises for, you said neuronal or something that would sound... Energetics."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "Energetics, sounds like a cool term."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "So, I mean, the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that of nearby species."}, {"time": 8699, "text": "We talked about that last time that basically we are able to consume meat that is incredibly energy rich, and that allows us to sort of have functions that are meeting this humongous brain that we have."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "So basically on one hand, every one of our brain cells is much more energy efficient than our neighbors, than our relatives."}, {"time": 8720, "text": "Number two, we have way more of these cells."}, {"time": 8723, "text": "And number three, we have this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs."}, {"time": 8730, "text": "That basically creates a massive amount of damage, oxidative damage from this huge super powered factory of ideas and thoughts that we carry in our skull."}, {"time": 8742, "text": "And that factory has energetic needs, and there's a lot of sort of biological processes underlying that, that we are finding are altered in the context of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"time": 8753, "text": "So you have to consider all of these systems if you want to understand even something like diseases that you would maybe traditionally associate with just the particular cells of the brain."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "The immune system, the metabolic system, the metabolic system."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "And these are all the things that makes us uniquely human."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "So our immune system is dramatically different from that of our neighbors."}, {"time": 8777, "text": "Our societies are so much more clustered."}, {"time": 8779, "text": "The history of infection that have plagued the human population is dramatically different from every other species."}, {"time": 8787, "text": "The way that our society and our population has sort of exploded has basically put unique pressures on our immune system."}, {"time": 8793, "text": "And our immune system has both coped with that density and also been shaped by, as I mentioned, the vast amount of death that has happened in the Black Plague and other sort of selective events in human history, famines, ice ages, and so forth."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "So that's number one on the sort of immune side."}, {"time": 8809, "text": "On the metabolic side, again, we are able to sort of run marathons."}, {"time": 8815, "text": "I don't know if you remember the sort of human versus horse experiment where the horse actually tires out faster than the human and the human actually wins."}, {"time": 8823, "text": "So on the metabolic side, we're dramatically different."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "On the immune side, we're dramatically different."}, {"time": 8827, "text": "On the brain side, again, you know, no need to sort of, you know, it's a no brainer of how our brain is like just enormously more capable."}, {"time": 8836,

"text": "And the lifespan, the expansion of human lifespan is unseen in any other species in, you know, recent evolutionary history."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "And that now leads to a lot of new disorders that are starting to, you know, manifest late in life."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "So you know, Alzheimer's is one example where basically, you know, these vast energetic needs over a

noise?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "It's like white noise, but deeper."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "So like the white noise is like shh, and then brown noise is more like, shh, like ocean."}, {"time":

still carrying the burdens of that decision."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "But yeah, sleep is one of those things that's making me wonder about the variability between humans a little bit and how science

the core of your comedy already."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "And that's interesting, that's a step ahead."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life, I can like hear the music from a distance, like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything, this is the direction it'll be without actually knowing exactly all the steps."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "And that's a

super self critical, I think."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "But then that's why it's fucking terrifying to walk up to a stage, stand there, and probably forget everything."}, {"time": 2674, "text":

board and you're like, ah, how's that, ah, camera, camera out it goes."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "And you just hate yourself, it's a nightmare."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "But you've already kind of, maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever, but you kind of know your voice and that's pretty advanced."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So you're not trying to be somebody else, I guess."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "Yeah, just for having done like podcasts and lecture and so on."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "I've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself in front of others for prolonged periods of time."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Yeah, so I've done that without actually developing the funny."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "No, it's super difficult, of course, but I mean, maybe the essential work of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment of like finding who you are."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Yeah, that's a part of it for sure."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "You know, in the beginning you're like, water bottle, what's funny about water bottle?"},

beautiful, beautiful woman."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I go, well, you look like her, and they go, fuck you."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And you're like, there's a lot of truth there."}, {"time": 2780,

finite set of like under a million, something like that."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I mean, it's kind of ridiculous that we're doing a distribution over every single possible word for language and it works."}, {"time": 882, "text": "It feels like that's a really dumb way to do it."}, {"time": 886, "text": "Like there seems to be like there should be some more compressed representation of the distribution of the words."}, {"time": 895, "text": "You're right about that."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And so do you have any interesting ideas about how to represent all of reality in a compressed way such that you can form a distribution over it?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "That's one of the big questions, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Right, I mean, what's kind of another thing that really is stupid about, I shouldn't say stupid, but like simplistic about current approaches to self supervised learning in NLP in text is that not only do you represent a giant distribution over words, but for multiple words that are missing, those distributions are essentially independent of each other."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And you don't pay too much of a price for this."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So you can't, so the system in the sentence that I gave earlier, if it gives a certain probability for a lion and cheetah, and then a certain probability for gazelle, wildebeest and zebra, those two probabilities are independent of each other."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And it's not the case that those things are independent."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Lions actually attack like bigger animals than cheetahs."}, {"time": 961, "text": "So there's a huge independent hypothesis in this process, which is not actually true."}, {"time": 967, "text": "The reason for this is that we don't know how to represent properly distributions over combinatorial sequences of symbols, essentially because the number grows exponentially with the length of the symbols."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And so we have to use tricks for this, but those techniques can get around, like don't even deal with it."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So the big question is would there be some sort of abstract latent representation of text that would say that when I switch lion for gazelle, lion for cheetah, I also have to switch zebra for gazelle?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Yeah, so this independence assumption, let me throw some criticism at you that I often hear and see how you respond."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So this kind of filling in the blanks is just statistics."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "You're not learning anything like the deep underlying concepts."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "You're just mimicking stuff from the past."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You're not learning anything new such that you can

discussions because they are kind of pointless."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So first of all, it's quite possible that intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It's just statistics of a particular kind."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Yes, this is the philosophical question."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "It's kind of is it possible that intelligence is just statistics?"}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Yeah, but what kind of statistics?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So if you are asking the question, are the models of the world that we learn, do they have some notion of causality?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So if the criticism comes from people who say, current machine learning system don't care about causality, which by the way is wrong, I agree with them."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Your model of the world should have your actions as one of the inputs."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "And that will drive you to learn causal models of the world where you know what intervention in the world will cause what result."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Or you can do this by observation of other agents acting in the world and observing the effect."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Other humans, for example."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So I think at some level of description, intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "But that doesn't mean you don't have models that have deep mechanistic explanation for what goes on."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The question is how do you learn them?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "That's the question I'm interested in."}, {"time": 1124, "text":

have to come from I don't know what."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And obviously we learn them."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Or if we don't learn them as an individual, nature learn them for us using evolution."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So regardless of what you think, those processes have been learned somehow."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So if you look at the human brain, just like when we humans introspect about how the brain works, it seems like when we think about what is intelligence, we think about the high level stuff, like the models we've constructed, concepts like cognitive science, like concepts of memory and reasoning module, almost like these high level modules."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Is this serve as a good analogy?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like are we ignoring the dark

ignoring that at the low level, the neural network might be doing something like statistics."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Like meaning, sorry to use this word probably incorrectly and crudely, but doing this kind of fill in the gap kind of learning and just kind of updating the model constantly in order to be able to support the raw sensory information to predict it and then adjust to the prediction

kind of simple, large neural network that's just filling in the gaps."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Right, well, okay."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So there's a lot of questions and a lot of answers there."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Okay, so first of all, there's a whole school of thought in neuroscience, computational neuroscience in particular, that likes the idea of predictive coding, which is

have as much common sense as a house cat."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So how is it that cats learn?"}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And cats don't do a whole lot of reasoning."}, {"time": 1307, "text":

extent, I could say, let's not even worry about like the high level cognition and kind of longterm planning and reasoning that humans can do until we figure out like, can we even reproduce what cats are doing?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Now that said, this ability to learn world models, I think is the key to the possibility of learning machines that can also reason."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "So whenever I give a talk, I say there are three challenges in the three main challenges in machine learning."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "The first one is getting machines to learn to represent the world and I'm proposing self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "The second is getting machines to reason in ways that are compatible with essentially gradient based learning because this is what deep learning is all about really."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And the third one is something we have no idea how to solve, at least I have no idea how to solve is can we get machines to learn hierarchical representations of action plans?"}, {"time": 1397, "text": "We know how to train them to learn hierarchical representations of perception with convolutional nets and things like that and transformers, but what about action plans?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Can we get them to spontaneously learn good hierarchical representations of actions?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Also gradient based."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Yeah, all of that needs to be somewhat differentiable so that you can apply sort of gradient based learning, which is really what deep learning is about."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So it's background, knowledge, ability to reason in a way that's differentiable that is somehow connected, deeply integrated with that background knowledge or builds on top of that background knowledge and then given that background knowledge be able to make hierarchical plans in the world."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So if you take classical optimal control, there's something in classical optimal control called model predictive control."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And it's been around since the early sixties."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "NASA uses that to compute trajectories of rockets."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And the basic idea is that you have a predictive model of the rocket, let's say, or whatever system you intend to control, which given the state of the system at time T and given an action that you're taking the system."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So for a rocket to be thrust and all the controls you can have, it gives you the state of the system at time T plus Delta T, right?"}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So basically a differential equation, something like that."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "And if you have this model and you have this model in the form of some sort of neural net or some sort of a set of formula that you can back propagate gradient through, you can do what's called model predictive control or gradient based model predictive control."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So you can unroll that model in time."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "You feed it a hypothesized sequence of actions."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And then you have some objective

you grasped the object you want to grasp?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "If it's a rocket, are you at the right place near the space station, things like that."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And by back propagation through time, and again, this was invented in the 1960s, by optimal control theorists, you can figure out what is the optimal sequence of actions that will get my system to the best final state."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's basically planning."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And a lot of planning systems in robotics are actually based on this."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And you can think of this as a form of reasoning."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So to take the example of the teenager driving a car, you have a pretty good dynamical model of the car."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "It doesn't need to be very accurate."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "But you know, again, that if you turn the wheel to the right and there is a cliff, you're gonna run off the cliff, right?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "You don't need to have a very accurate model to predict that."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And you can run this in your mind and decide not to do it for that reason."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Because you can predict in advance that the result is gonna be bad."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So you can sort of imagine different scenarios and then employ or take the first step in the scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process again."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "The scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process of planning."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "That's called receding horizon model predictive control."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So even all those things have names going back decades."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And so if you're not a classical optimal control, the model of the world is not generally learned."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Sometimes a few parameters you have to identify."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "That's called systems identification."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But generally, the model is mostly deterministic and mostly built by hand."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So the question of AI, I think the big challenge of AI for the next decade is how do we get machines to learn predictive models of the world that deal with uncertainty and deal with the real world in all this complexity?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So it's not just the trajectory of a rocket, which you can reduce to first principles."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's not even just the trajectory of a robot arm, which again, you can model by careful mathematics."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "But it's everything else, everything we observe in the world."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "People, behavior, physical systems that involve collective phenomena,

with machines."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Where do you put in these three, maybe in the planning stages, the game theoretic nature of this world, where your actions not only respond to the dynamic

representation of action in your view?"}, {"time": 1686, "text": "I think it's integrated."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "It's just that now your model of the world has to deal with, it just makes it more complicated."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "The fact that humans are complicated and not easily predictable, that makes your model of the world much more complicated, that much more complicated."},

you go."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Like Andre Capote recently gave a talk at MIT about car doors."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I think there's some machine learning too, but mostly car doors."},

perception problem of what the ontology of what defines a car door, this big philosophical question."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "But to me, it was interesting because it's obvious that the person

guess you can integrate all of them to one giant model, like the entirety of these little interactions."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "Because it's not as complicated as chess."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "It's just like a little dance."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "We do like a little dance together, and then we figure it out."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "Well, in some ways it's way more complicated than chess because it's continuous, it's uncertain in a continuous manner."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "It doesn't feel more complicated."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But it doesn't feel more complicated because that's what we've evolved to solve."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "This is the kind of problem we've evolved to solve."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And so we're good at it because nature has made us

game, is to be challenging."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And if there is something that recent progress in chess and Go has made us realize is that humans are really terrible at those things, like really bad."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "There was a story right before AlphaGo that the best Go players thought there were maybe two or three stones behind an ideal player that they would call God."},

have limited working memory."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We're not very good at doing this tree exploration that computers are much better at doing than we are."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "But we are much better at learning differentiable models to the world."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "I mean, I said differentiable in a kind of, I should say not differentiable in the sense that we went back far through it, but in the sense that our brain has some mechanism for estimating gradients of some kind."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And that's what makes us efficient."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So if you have an agent that consists of a model of the world, which in the human brain is basically the entire front half of your brain, an objective function, which in humans is a combination of two things."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "There is your sort of intrinsic motivation module, which is in the basal ganglia, the base of your brain."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "That's the thing that measures pain and hunger and things like that, like immediate feelings and emotions."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And then there is the equivalent of what people in reinforcement learning call a critic, which is a sort of module that predicts ahead what the outcome of a situation will be."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And so it's not a cost function, but it's sort of not an objective function, but it's sort of a train predictor of the ultimate objective function."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And that also is differentiable."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And so if all of this is differentiable, your cost function, your critic, your world model, then you can use gradient based type methods to do planning, to do reasoning, to do learning, to do all the things that we'd like an intelligent agent to do."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "And gradient based learning, like what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 1935, "text": "That's probably at the core of what can solve intelligence."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So you don't need like logic based reasoning in your view."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I don't know how to make logic based reasoning compatible with efficient learning."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Okay, I mean, there is a big question, perhaps a philosophical question."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "I mean, it's not that philosophical, but that we can ask is that all the learning algorithms we know from engineering and computer science proceed by optimizing some objective function."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So one question we may ask is, does learning in the brain minimize an objective function?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "I mean, it could be a composite of multiple objective functions, but it's still an objective function."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Second, if it does optimize an objective function, does it do it by some sort of gradient estimation?"}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It doesn't need to be a back prop, but some way of estimating the gradient in efficient manner whose complexity is on the same order of magnitude as actually running the inference."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Because you can't afford to do things like perturbing a weight in your brain to figure out what the effect is."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And then sort of, you can do sort of estimating gradient by perturbation."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "To me, it seems very implausible that the brain uses some sort of zeroth order black box gradient free optimization, because it's so much less efficient than gradient optimization."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "So it has to have a way of estimating gradient."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "Is it possible that some kind of logic based reasoning emerges in pockets as a useful, like you said, if the brain is an objective function, maybe it's a mechanism for creating objective functions."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "It's a mechanism for creating knowledge bases, for example, that can then be queried."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Like maybe it's like an efficient representation of knowledge that's learned in a gradient based way or something like that."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "Well, so I think there is a lot of different types of intelligence."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "So first of all, I think the type of logical reasoning that we think about that we are maybe stemming from sort of classical AI of the 1970s and 80s."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I think humans use that relatively rarely and are not particularly good at it."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "But we judge each other based on our ability to solve those rare problems."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "It's called an IQ test."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "Like I'm not very good at chess."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "Yes, I'm judging you this whole time."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Because, well, we actually."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "With your heritage, I'm sure you're good at chess."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "No, stereotypes."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "Not all stereotypes are true."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Well, I'm terrible at chess."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So, but I think perhaps another type of intelligence that I have is this ability of sort of building models to the world from reasoning obviously, but also data."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And those models generally are more kind of analogical."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So it's reasoning by simulation, and by analogy, where you use one model to apply to a new situation."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "Even though you've never seen that situation, you can sort of connect it to a situation you've encountered before."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And your reasoning is more akin to some sort of internal simulation."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So you're kind of simulating what's happening when you're building, I don't know, a box out of wood or something, right?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "You can imagine in advance what would be the result of cutting the wood in this particular way."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Are you going to use screws or nails or whatever?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "When you are interacting with someone, you also have a model of that person and sort of interact with that person, having this model in mind to kind of tell the person what you think is useful to them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So I think this ability to construct models to the world is basically the essence, the essence of intelligence."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And the ability to use it then to plan actions that will fulfill a particular criterion, of course, is necessary as well."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "So I'm going to ask you a series of impossible questions as we keep asking, as I've been doing."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "So if that's the fundamental sort of dark matter of intelligence, this ability to form a background model, what's your intuition about how much knowledge is required?"}, {"time": 2201, "text": "You know, I think dark matter, you could put a percentage on it of the composition of the universe and how much of it is dark matter, how much of it is dark energy, how much information do you think is required to be a house cat?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "So you have to be able to, when you see a box going in, when you see a human compute the most evil action, if there's a thing that's near an edge, you knock it off, all of that, plus the extra stuff you mentioned, which is a great self awareness of the physics of your own body and the world."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "How much knowledge is required, do you think, to solve it?"}, {"time": 2242, "text": "I don't even know how to measure an answer to that question."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "I'm not sure how to measure it, but whatever it is, it fits in about 800,000 neurons, 800 million neurons."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "What's the representation does?"}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Everything, all knowledge, everything, right?"}, {"time": 2260, "text": "You know, it's less than a billion."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "A dog is 2 billion, but a cat is less than 1 billion."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "And so multiply that by a thousand and you get the number of synapses."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And I think almost all of it is learned through this, you know, a sort of self supervised running, although, you know, I think a tiny sliver is learned through reinforcement running and certainly very little through, you know, classical supervised running, although it's not even clear how supervised running actually works in the biological world."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So I think almost all of it is self supervised running, but it's driven by the sort of ingrained objective functions that a cat or a human have at the base of their brain, which kind of drives their behavior."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So, you know, nature tells us you're hungry."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "It doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "That's something that the rest of our brain has to figure out, right?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "What's interesting is there might be more like deeper objective functions than allowing the whole thing."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So hunger may be some kind of, now you go to like neurobiology, it might be just the brain trying to maintain homeostasis."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "So hunger is just one of the human perceivable symptoms of the brain being unhappy with the way things are currently."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "It could be just like one really dumb objective function at the core."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "But that's how behavior is driven."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "The fact that, you know, or basal ganglia drive us to do things that are different from say an orangutan or certainly a cat is what makes, you know, human nature versus orangutan nature versus cat nature."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So for example, you know, our basal ganglia drives us to seek the company of other humans."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And that's because nature has figured out that we need to be social animals for our species to survive."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And it's true of many primates."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "It's not true of orangutans."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "Orangutans are solitary animals."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "They don't seek the company of others."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "In fact, they avoid them."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "In fact, they scream at them when they come too close because they're territorial."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "Because for their survival, you know, evolution has figured out that's the best thing."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "I mean, they're occasionally social, of course, for, you know, reproduction and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "But they're mostly solitary."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "So all of those behaviors are not part of intelligence."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "You know, people say, oh, you're never gonna have intelligent machines because, you know, human intelligence is social."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "But then you look at orangutans, you look at octopus."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Octopus never know their parents."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "They barely interact with any other."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "And they get to be really smart in less than a year, in like half a year."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "You know, in a year, they're adults."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "In two years, they're dead."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "So there are things that we think, as humans, are intimately linked with intelligence, like social interaction, like language."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "We think, I think we give way too much importance to language as a substrate of intelligence as humans."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Because we think our reasoning is so linked with language."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "So to solve the house cat intelligence problem, you think you could do it on a desert island."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "You could have, you could just have a cat sitting there looking at the waves, at the ocean waves, and figure a lot of it out."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "It needs to have sort of, you know, the right set of drives to kind of, you know, get it to do the thing and learn the appropriate things, right, but like for example, you know, baby humans are driven to learn to stand up and walk."}, {"time": 2482,

and stand up, that's sort of probably hardwired."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "But it's very simple to hardwire this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "Oh, like the desire to, well, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "You're hardwired to want to walk."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "That's not, there's gotta be a deeper need for walking."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "I think it was probably socially imposed by society that you need to walk all the other bipedal."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "No, like a lot of simple animals that, you know, will probably walk without ever watching any other members of the species."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "It seems like a scary thing to have to do because you suck at bipedal walking at first."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "It seems crawling is much safer, much more like, why are you in a hurry?"}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Well, because you have this thing that drives you to do it, you know, which is sort of part of the sort of human development."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Is that understood actually what?"}, {"time": 2546, "text": "Not entirely, no."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "What's the reason you get on two feet?"}, {"time":

pretty well."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So that's transfer learning, okay?"}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Or weakly supervised transfer learning."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "People are making very, very fast progress using self supervised learning for this kind of scenario as well."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "And my guess is that that's gonna be the future."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "For self supervised learning, how much cleaning do you think is needed for filtering malicious signal or what's a better term?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "But like a lot of people use hashtags on Instagram to get like good SEO that doesn't fully represent the contents of the image."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "Like they'll put a picture of a cat and hashtag it with like science, awesome, fun."}, {"time":

so data augmentation."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "I mean, first data augmentation is the idea of artificially increasing the size of your training set by distorting the images that you have in ways that don't change the nature of the image, right?"}, {"time": 2792, "text": "So you do MNIST, you can do data augmentation on MNIST and people have done this since the 1990s, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "You take a MNIST digit and you shift it a little bit or you change the size or rotate it, skew it, you know, et cetera."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "Add noise."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "Add noise, et cetera."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "And it works better if you train a supervised classifier with augmented data, you're gonna get better results."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Now it's become really interesting over the last couple of years because a lot of self supervised learning techniques to pre train vision systems are based on data augmentation."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And the basic techniques is originally inspired by techniques that I worked on in the early 90s and Jeff Hinton worked on also in the early 90s."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "They were sort of parallel work."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "I used to call this Siamese network."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So basically you take two identical copies of the same network, they share the same weights and you show two different views of the same object."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "Either those two different views may have been obtained by data augmentation or maybe it's two different views of the same scene from a camera that you moved or at different times or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 2861, "text": "Or two pictures of the same person, things like that."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And then you train this neural net, those two identical copies of this neural net to produce an output representation, a vector in such a way that the representation for those two images are as close to each other as possible, as identical to each other as possible, right?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Because you want the system to basically learn a function that will be invariant, that will not change, whose output will not change when you transform those inputs in those particular ways, right?"}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So that's easy to do."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "What's complicated is how do you make sure that when you show two images that are different, the system will produce different things?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Because if you don't have a specific provision for this, the system will just ignore the inputs when you train it, it will end up ignoring the input and just produce a constant vector that is the same for every input, right?"}, {"time": 2913, "text": "That's called a collapse."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "Now, how do you avoid collapse?"}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So there's two ideas."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "One idea that I proposed in the early 90s with my colleagues at Bell Labs, Jane Barmley and a couple other people, which we now call contrastive learning, which is to have negative examples, right?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "So you have pairs of images that you know are different and you show them to the network and those two copies, and then you push the two output vectors away from each other and it will eventually guarantee that things that are semantically similar produce similar representations and things that are different produce different representations."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "We actually came up with this idea for a project of doing signature verification."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "So we would collect signatures from, like multiple signatures on the same person and then train a neural net to produce the same representation and then force the system to produce different representation for different signatures."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "This was actually, the problem was proposed by people from what was a subsidiary of AT&T at the time called NCR."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And they were interested in storing representation of the signature on the 80 bytes of the magnetic strip of a credit card."},

encoding was then used to compare whether the signature matches or not."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So then you would sign, you would run through the neural net and then you would compare the output vector to whatever is stored on your card."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "Did it actually work?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "It worked, but they ended up not using it."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "Because nobody cares actually."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "I mean, the American financial payment system is incredibly lax in that respect compared to Europe."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "Oh, with the signatures?"}, {"time": 3018, "text": "What's the purpose of signatures anyway?"}, {"time": 3020, "text": "This is very different."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Nobody looks at them, nobody cares."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "It's, yeah."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Yeah, no, so that's contrastive learning, right?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So you need positive and negative pairs."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And the problem with that is that, even though I had the original paper on this, I'm actually not very positive about it because it doesn't work in high dimension."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "If your representation is high dimensional, there's just too many ways for two things to be different."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And so you would need lots and lots and lots of negative pairs."},

similar, but sufficiently different."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "It's an important step and it's also an annoying step because you need to have that knowledge of what data augmentation you can do that do not change the nature of the object."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "And so the standard scenario, which a lot of people working in this area are using is you use the type of distortion."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "So basically you do a geometric distortion."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "So one basically just shifts the image a little bit, it's called cropping."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Another one kind of changes the scale a little bit."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "Another one kind of rotates it."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "Another one changes the colors."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "You can do a

have like a catalog of kind of standard things and people try to use the same ones for different algorithms so that they can compare."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "But some algorithms, some self supervised algorithm actually can deal with much bigger, like more aggressive data augmentation and some don't."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So that kind of makes the whole thing difficult."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "But that's the kind of distortions we're talking about."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And so you train with those distortions and then you chop off the last layer, a couple layers of the network and you use the representation as input to a classifier."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "You train the classifier on ImageNet, let's say, or whatever, and measure the performance."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And interestingly enough, the methods that are really good at eliminating the information that is irrelevant, which is the distortions between those images, do a good job at eliminating it."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And as a consequence, you cannot use the representations in those systems for things like object detection and localization because that information is gone."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So the type of data augmentation you need to do depends on the tasks you want eventually the system to solve and the type of data augmentation, standard data augmentation that we use today are only appropriate for object recognition or image classification."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "They're not appropriate for things like."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Can you help me out understand what wide localizations?"}, {"time": 3300, "text": "So you're saying it's just not good at the negative, like at classifying the negative, so that's why it can't be used for the localization?"},

it is."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "Like a bounding box, like they'd be able to actually."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "Okay, it can still find the object in the image, it's just not very good at finding the exact boundaries of that object, interesting."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "Interesting, which that's an interesting sort of philosophical question, how important is object localization anyway?"},

what are the contents of the scene."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "On the other hand, I think evolutionarily, the first vision systems in animals were basically all about localization, very little about recognition."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And in the human brain, you have two separate pathways for recognizing the nature of a scene or an object and localizing objects."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So you use the first pathway called eventual pathway for telling what you're looking at."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "The other pathway, the dorsal pathway, is used for navigation, for grasping, for everything else."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "And basically a lot of the things you need for survival are localization and detection."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Is similarity learning or contrastive learning, are these non contrastive methods the same as understanding something?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Just because you know a distorted cat is the same as a non distorted cat, does that mean you

think?"}, {"time": 3422, "text": "Is this just one trick on the path to doing self supervised learning?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Can we go really, really far?"}, {"time": 3430, "text": "I think we can go really far."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "So if we figure out how to use techniques of that type, perhaps very different, but the same nature, to train a system from video to do video prediction,

hopeless."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "But let me take an example."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "You take an object, I describe a situation to you."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "I take an object, I put it on the table and I push the table."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "It's completely obvious to you that the object will be pushed with the table, because it's sitting on it."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "There's no text in the world, I believe, that explains this."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "And so if you train a machine as powerful as it could be, your GPT 5000 or whatever it is, it's never gonna learn about this."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "That information is just not present in any text."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "Well, the question, like with the psych project, the dream I think is to have like 10 million, say facts like that, that give you a headstart, like a parent guiding you."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Now, we humans don't need a parent to tell us that the table will move, sorry, the smartphone will move with the table."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "But we get a lot of guidance in other ways."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So it's possible that we can give it a quick shortcut."},

bottom, now we're here."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "So the question is how, okay, the question is how fundamental is that, the nature of the whole hardware?"}, {"time": 3608, "text": "And then is there any way to shortcut it if it's fundamental?"}, {"time": 3612, "text": "If it's not, if it's most of intelligence, most of the cool stuff we've been talking about is mostly nurture, mostly trained."},

634, you know, in the list of problems we have to solve."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "So basic physics of the world is number one."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "What do you, just a quick tangent on data augmentation."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "So a lot of it is hard coded versus learned."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "Do you have any intuition that maybe there could be some weird data augmentation, like generative type of data augmentation, like doing something weird to images, which then improves the similarity learning process?"}, {"time": 3733, "text": "So not just kind of dumb, simple

of it, and then you train some giant neural net to reconstruct the parts that are missing."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "And until very recently, there was no working methods for that."}, {"time": 3779,

mask part of the image and you train a system, which in this case is a transformer because the transformer represents the image as non overlapping patches, so it's easy to mask patches and things like that."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Okay, but then my question transfers to that problem, the masking, like why should the mask be square or rectangle?"}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So it doesn't matter, like, you know, I think we're gonna come up probably in the future with sort of ways to mask that are kind of random, essentially, I mean, they are random already, but."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "No, no, but like something that's challenging, like optimally challenging."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "So like, I mean, maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply, but you're, it seems like there's a data augmentation or masking, there's an interactive element with it."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Like you're almost like playing with an image."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And like, it's like the way we play with an image in our minds."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "No, but it's like dropout."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "It's like Boston machine training."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "You, you know, every time you see a percept, you also, you can perturb it in some way."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And then the principle of the training procedure is to minimize the difference of the output or the representation between the clean version and the corrupted version, essentially, right?"}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And you can do this in real time, right?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So, you know, Boston machine work like this, right?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "You show a percept, you tell the machine that's a good combination of activities or your input neurons."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "And then you either let them go their merry way without clamping them to values, or you only do this with a subset."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "And what you're doing is you're training the system so that the stable state of the entire network is the same regardless of whether it sees the entire input or whether it sees only part of it."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "You know, denoising autoencoder method is basically the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "You're training a system to reproduce the input, the complete inputs and filling the input and filling the blanks, regardless of which parts are missing, and that's really the underlying principle."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And you could imagine sort of, even in the brain, some sort of neural principle where, you know, neurons kind of oscillate, right?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So they take their activity and then temporarily they kind of shut off to, you know, force the rest of the system to basically reconstruct the input without their help, you know?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And, I mean, you could imagine, you know, more or less biologically possible processes."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And I guess with this

time."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "Because I was thinking, like, you might want to be clever about the way you do all these procedures, you know, but that's only, it's somehow costly to do every iteration, but it's not really."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And then there is, you know, data augmentation without explicit data augmentation."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "This data augmentation by

machine."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So I think the action part would be necessary for having causal models of the world."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "The second reason it may be necessary, or at least

make the process exist."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "The, so what process, what learning process is it that active learning makes more efficient?"}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And I'm asking that first question, you know, you know, we haven't answered that question yet."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "So, you know, I worry about active learning once this question is..."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "So it's the more fundamental question to ask."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "And if active learning or interaction increases the efficiency of the learning, see, sometimes it becomes very different if the increase is several orders of magnitude, right?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "Like... That's true."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "But fundamentally it's still the same thing and building up the intuition about how to, in a self supervised way to construct background models, efficient or

orthodox folk speculative hypothesis about consciousness."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So we're talking about the study of a world model."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "And I think, you know, our entire prefrontal cortex basically is the engine for a world model."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "But when we are attending at a particular situation, we're focused on that situation."}, {"time": 4846, "text":

a task that we do repeatedly, it goes from the sort of deliberate reasoning using model of the world and prediction and perhaps something like model predictive control, which I was talking about

wiped out in 10 plays, right?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And I have to think about my move for like 15 minutes."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "And the person in front of me, the grandmaster, would just react within seconds, right?"}, {"time": 4916, "text": "He doesn't need to think about it."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "That's become part of the subconscious because it's basically just pattern

to stop talking."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So that suggests you only have one model in your head."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "And it might suggest the idea that consciousness basically is the module that configures this world model of yours."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "You need to have some sort of executive kind of overseer that configures your world model for the situation at hand."}, {"time":

there's some kind of chemicals in biology that's creating a feeling, like it feels to experience some of these things."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "That's kind of like the hard question is, what the heck is that and why is that useful?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Maybe the more pragmatic question, why is it useful to feel like this is really you experiencing this versus just like information being processed?"}, {"time": 5014, "text": "It could be just a very nice side effect of the way we evolved."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "That's just very useful to feel a sense of ownership to the decisions you make, to the perceptions you make, to the model you're trying to maintain."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "Like you own this thing and this is the only one you got and if you lose it, it's gonna really suck."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "And so you should really send the brain some signals about it."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "So what ideas do you believe might be true that most or at least many people

just a better planning engine because it makes us, as I said, the essence of intelligence is the ability to predict."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "And so the, because we're smarter as a side effect, we

ran it for three and a half years as a director, you know, hired the first few scientists and kind of set up the culture and organized it, you know, explained to the Facebook leadership what fundamental research was about and how it can work within industry and how it needs to be open and everything."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And so if you were to take out, you know, deep learning out of

I'm not doing day to day management of FAIR anymore."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "I'm more of a kind of, you know, think about strategy and things like that."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "And I carry my, I conduct my own research."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I have, you know, my own kind of research group working on self supervised learning and things like this, which I didn't have time to do when I was director."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "So now FAIR is run by Joel Pinot and Antoine Bord together because FAIR is kind of split in two now."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "There's something called FAIR Labs,

over."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So there's no question that the leadership of the company believes that this was a very worthwhile investment."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "And what that means is that it's there for the long run."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "So if you want to talk in these terms, which I don't like, this is a business model, if you want, where FAIR, despite being a very fundamental research lab brings a lot of value to the company, either mostly indirectly through other groups."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "Now what happened three and a half years ago when I stepped down was also the creation of Facebook AI, which was basically a larger organization that covers FAIR, so FAIR is included in it, but also has other organizations that are focused on applied research or advanced

plausible predictions, okay?"}, {"time": 7698, "text": "So, that's called, I call this a generative latent variable model."}, {"time": 7704, "text": "Okay, now there is an alternative to this, to handle uncertainty."}, {"time": 7708, "text": "And instead of directly predicting the next frames of the clip, you also run those through another neural net."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "So, you now have two neural nets, one that looks at the initial segment of the video clip, and another one that looks at the continuation during training, right?"}, {"time": 7733, "text": "And what you're trying to do is learn a representation of those two video clips that is maximally informative about the video clips themselves, but is such that you can predict the representation of the second video clip

matter."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "What you want is informative representations of the two video clips that are mutually predictable."}, {"time": 7768, "text": "What that means is that there's a lot of details in the second video clips that are irrelevant."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "Let's say a video clip consists in a camera panning the scene, there's gonna be a piece of that room that is gonna be revealed, and I can somewhat predict what that room is gonna look like, but I may not be able to predict the details of the texture of the ground and where the tiles are ending and stuff like that, right?"}, {"time": 7794, "text": "So, those are irrelevant details that perhaps my representation will eliminate."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "And so, what I need is to train this second neural net in such a way that whenever the continuation video clip varies over all the plausible continuations, the representation doesn't change."}, {"time": 7816, "text": "So, it's the, yeah, yeah, got it."},

multimodality in a prediction, right?"}, {"time": 7829, "text": "In the first way, you parameterize the prediction with a latent variable, but you predict pixels essentially, right?"}, {"time": 7835,
