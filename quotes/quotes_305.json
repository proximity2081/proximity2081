the universe that birds of gamma rays, uh, these are, uh, high energy, uh, rays of light that actually can apparently kill entire galaxy."}, {"time": 404, "text": "So there might be actually nothing, even to, nothing to protect us from it."}, {"time": 408, "text": "I'm also, and I'm looking actually at the past civilizations."}, {"time": 411, "text": "So it's like Aztecs or so they disappear from the surface of the earth."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And one can ask, why is it the case?"}, {"time": 420, "text": "And the way I'm thinking about it is, you know, that definitely they had some problem that they couldn't solve and maybe there was a flood and all of a sudden they couldn't drink, uh, there was no potable water and they all died."}, {"time": 435, "text": "And, um, I think that, uh, so far the best solution to such a problems is I guess, technology, so, I mean, if they would know that you can just boil water and then drink it after, then that would save their civilization."}, {"time": 451, "text": "And even now, when we look actually at the current pandemic, it seems that there, once again, actually science comes to rest."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And somehow science increases size of the action space."}, {"time": 464, "text": "But nature has a vastly larger action space, but still it might be a good thing for us to keep on increasing action space."}, {"time": 476, "text": "Uh, looking at past civilizations."}, {"time": 478, "text": "But looking at the destruction of human civilization, perhaps expanding the action space will add, um, actions that are easily acted upon, easily executed and as a result, destroy us."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So let's see, I was pondering, uh, why actually even, uh, we have negative impact on the, uh, globe."}, {"time": 504, "text": "Because, you know, if you ask every single individual, they would like to have clean air."}, {"time": 509, "text": "They would like healthy planet, but somehow it's not."}, {"time": 512, "text": "It's not the case that as a collective, we are not going in this direction."}, {"time": 516, "text": "I think that there exists very powerful system to describe what we value."}, {"time": 522, "text": "It assigns actually monetary values to various activities."}, {"time": 525, "text": "At the moment, the problem in the current system is that there's some things which we value."}, {"time": 530, "text": "There is no cost assigned to it."}, {"time": 532, "text": "So even though we value clean air, or maybe we also, uh, value, uh, value lack of destruction on, let's say internet or so at the moment, these quantities, you know, companies, corporations can pollute them, uh, for free."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So in some sense, I wished or like, and that's, I guess, purpose of politics to, to align the incentive systems."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And we are kind of maybe even moving in this direction."}, {"time": 565, "text": "The first issue is even to be able to measure the things that we value."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Then we can actually assign the monetary value to them."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And that's, so it's getting the data and also probably through technology, enabling people to vote and to move money around in a way that is aligned with their values, and that's very much a technology question."}, {"time": 588, "text": "So like having one president and Congress and voting that happens every four years or something like that, that's a very outdated idea that could be some technological improvements to that kind of idea."}, {"time": 602, "text": "So I'm thinking from time to time about these topics, but it's also feels to me that it's, it's a little bit like, uh, it's hard for me to actually make correct predictions."}, {"time": 611, "text": "What is the appropriate thing to do?"}, {"time": 613, "text": "I extremely trust, uh, Sam Altman, our CEO on these topics here, um, like, uh, I'm more on the side of being, I guess, naive hippie."}, {"time": 624, "text": "That, uh, yeah, that's your life philosophy."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Um, well, like I think self doubt and, uh, I think hippie implies optimism."}, {"time": 637, "text": "Those, those two things are pretty, pretty good way to operate."}, {"time": 641, "text": "I mean, still, it is hard for me to actually understand how the politics works or like, uh, how this, like, uh, exactly how the things would play out."}, {"time": 651, "text": "And Sam is, uh, really excellent with it."}, {"time": 654, "text": "What do you think is rarest in the universe?"}, {"time": 656, "text": "You said we might be alone."}, {"time": 658, "text": "What's hardest to build is another engineering way to ask that life, intelligence or consciousness."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So like you said that we might be alone, which is the thing that's hardest to get to, is it just the origin of life?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "Is it the origin of intelligence?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "Is it the origin of consciousness?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "So, um, let me at first explain to you my kind of mental model, what I think is needed for life to appear."}, {"time": 727, "text": "And in some sense, you can think almost that you have this gigantic graph and it needs like a sufficient number of edges for the cycle to appear."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Um, then, um, from perspective of intelligence and consciousness, uh, my current intuition is that they might be quite intertwined."}, {"time": 746, "text": "First of all, it might not be that it's like a binary thing that you have intelligence or consciousness."}, {"time": 750, "text": "It seems to be, uh, uh, more, uh, continuous component."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Let's see, if we look for instance on the event networks, uh, recognizing images and people are able to show that the activations of these networks correlate very strongly, uh, with activations in visual cortex, uh, of some monkeys, the same seems to be true about language models."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Um, also if you, for instance, um, look, um, if you train agent in, um, 3d world, um, at first, you know, it, it, it, it barely recognizes what is going on over the time, it kind of recognizes foreground from a background over the time, it kind of knows where there is a foot, uh, and it just follows it."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Um, over the time it actually starts having a 3d perception."}, {"time": 802, "text": "So it is possible for instance, to look inside of the head of an agent and ask, what would it see if it looks to the right?"}, {"time": 809, "text": "And the crazy thing is, you know, initially when the agents are barely trained, that these predictions are pretty bad over the time they become better and better, you can still see that if you ask what happens when the head is turned by 360 degrees for some time, they think that the different thing appears and then at some stage they understand actually that the same thing supposed to appear."}, {"time": 832, "text": "So they get that understanding of 3d structure."}, {"time": 835, "text": "It's also, you know, very likely that they have inside some level of, of like a symbolic reasoning, like a particular, these symbols for other agents."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So when you look at DOTA agents, they collaborate together and, uh, and, uh, no, they, they, they, they have some anticipation of, uh, if, if they would win battle, they have some, some expectations with respect to other agents."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I might be, you know, too much anthropomorphizing, um, the, the, the, how the things look, look, look for me, but then the fact that they have a symbol for other agents, uh, makes me believe that, uh, at some stage as the, uh, you know, as they are optimizing for skills, they would have also symbol to describe themselves."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Uh, this is like a very useful symbol to have."}, {"time": 886, "text": "And this particularity, I would call it like a self consciousness or self awareness, uh, and, uh, still it might be different from the consciousness."}, {"time": 895, "text": "So I guess the, the way how I'm understanding the word consciousness, I'd say the experience of drinking a coffee or let's say experience of being a bat, that's the meaning of the word consciousness."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It doesn't mean to be awake."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Uh, yeah, it feels, it might be also somewhat related to memory and recurrent connections."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So, um, it's kind of like, if you look at anesthetic drugs, they might be, uh, uh, like, uh, that they essentially, they, they disturb, uh, uh, brainwaves, uh, such that, um, maybe memories, not, not form."}, {"time": 933, "text": "And so there's a lessening of consciousness when you do that."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And so that's the one way to intuit what is consciousness."}, {"time": 941, "text": "There's also kind of another element here."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It could be that it's, you know, this kind of self awareness module that you described, plus the actual subjective experience is a storytelling module that tells us a story about, uh, what we're experiencing."}, {"time": 965, "text": "The crazy thing."}, {"time": 966, "text": "So let's say, I mean, in meditation, they teach people not to speak story inside of their head."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And there is also some fraction of population who doesn't have actually a narrator, I know people who don't have a narrator and, you know, they have to use external people in order to, um, kind of solve tasks that require internal narrator."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Um, so it seems that it's possible to have the experience without the talk."}, {"time": 997, "text": "What are we talking about when we talk about the internal narrator?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Is that the voice when you're like, yeah, I thought that that's what you are referring to while I was referring more on the, like, not an actual voice."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "I meant like, there's some kind of like subjective experience feels like it's."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "It's fundamentally about storytelling to ourselves."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "It feels like, like the feeling is a story that is much, uh, much simpler abstraction than the raw sensory information."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So there feels like it's a very high level of abstraction that, uh, is useful for me to feel like entity in this world."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "M most useful aspect of it is that because I'm conscious, I think there's an intricate connection to me, not wanting to die."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So like, it's a useful hack to really prioritize not dying, like those seem to be somehow connected."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "So I'm telling the story of like, it's rich."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "He feels like something to be me and the fact that me exists in this world."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "I want to preserve me."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And so that makes it a useful agent hack."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So I will just refer maybe to that first part, as you said, about that kind of story of describing who you are."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Um, I was, uh, thinking about that even, so, you know, obviously I'm, I, I like thinking about consciousness, uh, I like thinking about AI as well, and I'm trying to see analogies of these things in AI, what would it correspond to?"}, {"time": 1157, "text": "The primary, it's the, and so, but the context we provide to GPT is, uh, is multimodal."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "It's more so GPT itself is multimodal."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "GPT itself, uh, hasn't learned actually from experience of single human, but from the experience of humanity, it's a chameleon."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "You can turn it into anything and in some sense, by providing context, um, it, you know, behaves as the thing that you wanted it to be."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Um, it's interesting that the, you know, people have a stories of who they are."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And, uh, as you said, these stories, they help them to operate in the world."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Um, but it's also, you know, interesting, I guess, various people find it out through meditation or so that, uh, there might be some patterns that you have learned when you were a kid that actually are not serving you anymore."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And you also might be thinking that that's who you are and that's actually just a story."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So it's a useful hack, but sometimes it gets us into trouble."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "It's a local optima."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "You wrote that Stephen Hawking, he tweeted, Stephen Hawking asked what breathes fire into equations, which meant what makes given mathematical equations realize the physics of a universe."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Similarly, I wonder what breathes fire into computation."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "What makes given computation conscious?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "So how do we engineer consciousness?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "How do you breathe fire and magic?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "How do you breathe fire and magic into the machine?"}, {"time": 1251, "text": "So, um, it seems clear to me that not every computation is conscious."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "I mean, you can, let's say, just keep on multiplying one matrix over and over again and might be gigantic matrix."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "You can put a lot of computation."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I don't think it would be conscious."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So in some sense, the question is, uh, what are the computations which could be conscious, uh, I mean, so, so one assumption is that it has to do purely with computation that you can abstract away matter and other possibilities that it's very important was the realization of computation that it has to do with some, uh, uh, force fields or so, and they bring consciousness."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "At the moment, my intuition is that it can be fully abstracted away."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So in case of computation, you can ask yourself, what are the mathematical objects or so that could bring such a properties?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So for instance, if we think about the models, uh, AI models, the, what they truly try to do, uh, or like a models like GPT is, uh, uh, you know, they try to predict, uh, next word or so."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And this turns out to be equivalent to, uh, compressing, uh, text."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Um, and, uh, because in some sense, compression means that, uh, you learn the model of reality and you have just to, uh, remember where are your mistakes."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "The better you are in predicting the, and, and, and in some sense, when we look at our experience, also, when you look, for instance, at the car driving, you know, in which direction it will go, you are good like in prediction."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And, um, you know, it might be the case that the consciousness is intertwined with, uh, compression, it might be also the case that self consciousness, uh, has to do with compress or trying to compress itself."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "So, um, okay."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I was just wondering, what are the objects in, you know, mathematics or computer science, which are mysterious that could, uh, that, that, that could have to do with consciousness."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And then I thought, um, you know, you, you see in mathematics, there is something called Gadel theorem, uh, which means, okay, you have, if you have sufficiently complicated mathematical system, it is possible to point the mathematical system back on itself."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "In computer science, there is, uh, something called helping problem."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "It's, it's somewhat similar construction."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So I thought that, you know, if we believe that, uh, that, uh, that under assumption that consciousness has to do with, uh, with compression, uh, then you could imagine that the, that the, as you keep on compressing things, then at some point, it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Metacompression consciousness is metacompression."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "That's a, that's an I, an, an, an idea."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And in some sense, you know, the crazy, thank you."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "So, uh, but do you think if we think of a Turing machine, a universal Turing machine, can that achieve consciousness?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So is there some thing beyond our traditional definition of computation that's required?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So it's a specific computation."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "And I said, this computation has to do with compression and, uh, the compression itself, maybe other way of putting it is like, uh, you are internally creating the model of reality in order, like, uh, it's like a, you try inside to simplify reality in order to predict what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And, um, that also feels somewhat similar to how I think actually about my own conscious experience, though clearly I don't have access to reality."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "The only access to reality is through, you know, cable going to my brain and my brain is creating a simulation of reality and I have access to the simulation of reality."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "Are you by any chance, uh, aware of, uh, the Hutter prize, Marcus Hutter?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "He, uh, he made this prize for compression."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Uh, Wikipedia pages, and, uh, there's a few qualities to it."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "One, I think has to be perfect compression, which makes, I think that little cork makes it much less, um, applicable to the general task of intelligence, because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Uh, like perfect compression is feels like it's not the right goal, but it's nevertheless a very interesting goal."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So for him, intelligence equals compression."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And so the smaller you make the file, given a large Wikipedia page, the more intelligent the system has to be."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Yeah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So you can make perfect compression if you store errors."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And I think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Uh, by the way, Hutter, Hutter is, uh, he was a PhD advisor of Sean Leck, who is a DeepMind, uh, uh, DeepMind cofounder."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So there's an interesting, uh, and now he's a DeepMind, there's an interesting, uh, network of people."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And he's one of the people that I think seriously took on the task of what would an AGI system look like?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Uh, I think for a longest time, the question of AGI was not taken seriously or rather rigorously."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So he developed the framework even to describe what's optimal with respect to reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "Like there is a theoretical framework, which is, as you said, under assumption, there is infinite amount of memory and compute."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Um, there was actually one person before his name is Solomonov, who there extended, uh, Solomonov work to reinforcement learning, but there exists the, uh, theoretical algorithm, which is optimal algorithm to build intelligence and I can actually explain you the algorithm."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So the task itself, can I just pause how absurd it is for brain in a skull, trying to explain the algorithm for intelligence, just go ahead."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "It is pretty crazy."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It is pretty crazy that, you know, the brain itself is actually so small and it can ponder, uh, how to design algorithms that optimally solve the problem of intelligence."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So what's the algorithm?"}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So first of all, the task itself is, uh, described as, uh, you have infinite sequence of zeros and ones."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "You read, uh, N bits and they are about to predict N plus one bit."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So that's the task."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And you could imagine that every task could be casted as such a task."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So if for instance, you have images and labels, you can just turn every image into a sequence of zeros and ones, then label, you concatenate labels and you, and that that's actually the, the, and you could, you could start by having training data first, and then afterwards you have test data."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So theoretically any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting zeros and ones on this, uh, infinite tape."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So, um, so let's say you read already N bits and you want to predict N plus one bit, and I will ask you to write every possible program that generates these N bits."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "So, um, and you can have, you, you choose programming language."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "It can be Python or C plus plus."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And the difference between programming languages, uh, might be, there is a difference by constant asymptotically, your predictions will be equivalent."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So you read N bits, you enumerate all the programs that produce these N bits in their output."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And then in order to predict N plus one bit, you actually weight the programs according to their length."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And there is like a, some specific formula, how you weight them."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And then the N plus, uh, one bit prediction is the prediction, uh, from each of these program, according to that weight."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Like statistically, you pick, so the smaller the program, the more likely you, you are to pick the, its output."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "So, uh, that's, that algorithm is grounded in the hope or the intuition that the simple answer is the right one."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "It's a formalization of it."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Um, it also means like, if you would ask the question after how many years would, you know, sun explode, uh, you can say, hmm, it's more likely the answer is due to some power because they're shorter program."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Um, then other, well, I don't have a good intuition about, uh, how different the space of short programs are from the space of large programs."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Like, what is the universe where short programs, uh, like run things?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "Uh, so, so I said, the things have to agree with N bits."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "So even if you have, you, you need to start, okay."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "If, if you have very short program and they're like a steel, some has, if, if it's not perfectly prediction of N bits, you have to start errors."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "What are the errors?"}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And that gives you the full program that agrees on N bits."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Oh, so you don't agree with the N bits."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And you store, that's like a longer, a longer program, slightly longer program because it can take these extra bits of errors."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "What's what's your intuition about the, the programs that are able to do cool stuff like intelligence and consciousness, are they, uh, perfectly like, is, is it, uh, is there if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1865, "text": "So like, is there a lot of a good, uh, if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So like, is there a lot of exceptions that they're storing?"}, {"time": 1871, "text": "So, um, you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of if statements, then they wouldn't be that short."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "In case of neural networks, you could imagine that, um, what happens is, uh, they, uh, when you start with an initialized neural network, uh, it stores internally many possibilities, how the, uh, how the problem can be solved."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "And SGD is kind of magnifying some, some, uh, some, uh, paths, which are slightly similar to the correct answer."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "So it's kind of magnifying correct programs."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And in some sense, SGD is a search algorithm in the program space and the program space is represented by, uh, you know, kind of the wiring inside of the neural network and there's like an insane number of ways how the features can be computed."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "Let me ask you the high level, basic question that's not so basic."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Is there a way you'd like to think of it that is different than like a generic textbook definition?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "The thing that I hinted just a second ago is maybe that, uh, closest to how I'm thinking these days about deep learning."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So, uh, now the statement is, uh, neural networks can represent some programs."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "Uh, it seems that various modules that we are actually adding up to, or like, uh, you know, we, we want networks to be deep because we, we want multiple steps of the computation and, uh, uh, and deep learning provides the way to represent space of programs, which is searchable and it's searchable with, uh, stochastic gradient descent."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So we have an algorithm to search over humongous number of programs and gradient descent kind of bubbles up the things that are, uh, tend to give correct answers."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So a neural network with a, with fixed weights that's optimized, do you think of that as a single program?"}, {"time": 1991, "text": "Um, so there is a, uh, work by Christopher Olaj where he, uh, so he works on interpretability of neural networks and he was able to, uh, to identify the neural network, for instance, a detector of a wheel for a car, or the detector of a mask for a car, and then he was able to separate them out and assemble them, uh, together using a simple program, uh, for the detector, for a car detector."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "That's like, uh, if you think of traditionally defined programs, that's like a function within a program that this particular neural network was able to find and you can tear that out, just like you can copy and paste it into a stack overflow that, so, uh, any program is a composition of smaller programs."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "I mean, the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the things to be more fuzzy than in case of programs."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Uh, in case of programs, you have this, like a branching this way or that way."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "And the neural networks, they, they have an easier way

profound talking about the space of programs, which is, which is very interesting, but also for people who just not familiar with the hell we're talking about when we talk about deep learning anyway,

about the trick, but like, uh, it's still, uh, I'm using to me that it works at all that let's say that the extremely simple algorithm stochastic gradient descent, which is something that I would be able to derive on the piece of paper to high school student, uh, when put at the, at the scale of, you know, thousands of machines actually, uh, can create the."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Behaviors we, which we called kind of human like behaviors."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So in general, any application is stochastic gradient descent to neural networks is, is amazing to you."}, {"time": 2174,

{"time": 2191, "text": "What profound insight can we take from the fact that the thing works for gigantic, uh, sets of variables?"}, {"time": 2199, "text": "I mean, the interesting thing is this algorithms, they were invented decades ago and, uh, people actually, uh, gave up on the idea and, um, you know, back then they thought that we need profoundly different algorithms and they spent a lot of cycles on very different algorithms."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "In the past people are, it's almost like a, out of the, maybe an ego, people are saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there, you know, uh, could solve complicated problems."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "So they were in search for the other algorithms."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And as I'm saying, like, I believe that actually we are in the game where there is, there are actually frankly three levers."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "There is compute, there are algorithms and there is data."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And, uh, if we want to build intelligent systems, we have to pull, uh, all three levers and they are actually multiplicative."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "Um, it's also interesting."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So you ask, is it only compute?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "Uh, people internally, they did the studies to determine how much gains they were coming from different levers."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And so far we have seen that more gains came from compute than algorithms, but also we are in the world that in case of compute, there is a kind of, you know, exponential increase in funding and at some point it's impossible to, uh, invest more, it's impossible to, you know, invest $10 trillion as we are speaking about the, let's say all taxes in us."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "Uh, but you're talking about money that could be innovation in the compute."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "That's that's true as well."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Uh, so I mean, they're like a few pieces."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Um, so it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Uh, it also might be the case that they are more efficient than brain or less efficient by some, by some huge factor."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Um, I also believe that there will be like a, you know, at the moment we are at the stage that the, these neural networks, they require thousand X or, or like a huge factor of more data than humans do."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "And it will be a matter of, uh, um, there will be algorithms that vastly decrease sample complexity, I believe so, but that place where we are heading today is there are domains which contains million X more data."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And even though computers might be 1000 times slower than humans in learning, that's not a problem."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Like, uh, for instance, uh, I believe that, uh, it should be possible to create super human therapist, uh, by, uh, and, and the, the, like, uh, even simple steps of, of, of doing what, of, of doing it."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "And, you know, the, the core reason is there is just machine will be able to read way more transcripts of therapies, and then it should be able to speak simultaneously with many more people and it should be possible to optimize it, uh, all in parallel."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And, uh, well, there's now you're touching on something I deeply care about and think is way harder than we imagine."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "Um, what's the goal of a therapist?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "What's the goal of therapies?"}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So, okay, so one goal now this is terrifying to me, but there's a lot of people that, uh, contemplate suicide, suffer from depression, uh, and they could significantly be helped with therapy and the idea that an AI algorithm might be in charge of that, it's like a life and death task."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's, uh, the stakes are high."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So one goal for a therapist, whether human or AI is to prevent suicide ideation to prevent suicide."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "How do you achieve that?"}, {"time": 2485, "text": "So to be clear, I don't think that the current models are good enough for such a task because it requires insane amount of understanding, empathy, and the models are far from this place, but it's."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "But do you think that understanding empathy, that signal is in the data?"}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Um, I think there is some signal in the data."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "I mean, there are plenty of transcripts of conversations and it is possible to, it is possible from it to understand personalities."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So there's another underlying question, which is self supervised versus supervised."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So can you get that from the data by just reading a huge number of transcripts?"}, {"time": 2596, "text": "I actually, so I think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "It's like at the same way as you cannot learn to dance if just from YouTube by watching it, you have to actually try it out yourself."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And so I think that here that's a similar situation."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "I also wouldn't deploy the system in the high stakes situations right away, but kind of see gradually where it goes."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And, uh, obviously initially, uh, it would have to go hand in hand with humans."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "But, uh, at the moment we are in the situation that actually there is many more people who actually would like to have a therapy or, or speak with, with someone than there are therapies out there."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "I can, you know, I was so, so fundamentally I was thinking, what are the things that, uh, can vastly increase people's well being therapy is one of them being meditation is other one, I guess maybe human connection is a third one, and I guess pharmacologically it's also possible, maybe direct brain stimulation or something like that."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "But these are pretty much options out there."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Then let's say the way I'm thinking about the AGI endeavor is by default, that's an endeavor to, uh, increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And I believe that we can invest the increase amount of wealth for everyone and simultaneously."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "So, I mean, there are like a two endeavors that make sense to me."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "One is like essentially increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And second one is, uh, increase overall human wellbeing."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And those are coupled together and they, they can, like, uh, I would say these are different topics."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "One can help another and, uh, you know, therapist is a, is a funny word because I see friendship and love as therapy."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "I mean, so therapist broadly defined as just friendship as a friend."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "So like therapist is, has a very kind of clinical sense to it, but what is human connection you're like, uh, not to get all Camus and Dostoevsky on you, but you know, life is suffering and we draw, we seek connection with the humans as we, uh, desperately try to make sense of this world in a deep overwhelming loneliness that we feel inside."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So I think connection has to do with understanding."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And I think that almost like a lack of understanding causes suffering."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "If you speak with someone and do you, do you feel ignored that actually causes pain?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, very much agree."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So I thought in the past about, um, somewhat similar question to yours, which is what is love, uh, rather what is connection."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "And, um, and obviously I think about these things from AI perspective."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "What would it mean?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Um, so I said that, um, you know, intelligence has to do with some compression, which is more or less like I can say, almost understanding of what is going around."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "It seems to me that, uh, other aspect is there seem to be reward functions and you can have, uh, uh, you know, reward for, uh, food, for maybe human connection, for, uh, let's say warmth, uh, sex and so on."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And, um, and it turns out that the various people might be optimizing slightly different, uh, reward functions."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "They essentially might care about different things."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "And, uh, uh, in case of, uh, love at least the love between two people, you can say that the, um, you know, boundary between people dissolves to such extent that, uh, they end up optimizing each other reward functions and yeah, oh, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Um, celebrate the success of each other."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "In some sense, I would say love means, uh, helping others to optimize their, uh, reward functions, not your reward functions, not the things that you think are important, but the things that the person cares about, you try to help them to, uh, optimize it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So love is, uh, if you think of two reward functions, you just, it's a condition."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "You combine them together, pretty much maybe like with a weight and it depends like the dynamic of the relationship."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "So for instance, if you look at, at the donut on the one level, you might think, oh, this is like, it looks tasty."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "I would like to eat it on other level."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "You might tell yourself, I shouldn't be doing it because I want to gain muscles."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and you know, you might do it regardless kind of against yourself."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "And like, I try to imagine, try to imagine if there would be like a small baby Lex, like a five years old, angry, and then they are like, you shouldn't be angry."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "Like stop being angry."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "But like an instant, actually you want the Lex to come over, give him a hug and just like, I say, it's fine."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "It's going to be angry as long as you want."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And then he would stop or, or maybe not, or maybe not, but you cannot expect it even."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "But still, that doesn't explain the why of love."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "Like why is love part of the human condition?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Why is it useful to combine the reward functions?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "It seems like that doesn't, I mean, I don't think reinforcement learning frameworks can give us answers to why even, even the Hutter framework has an objective function that's static."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So we came to existence as a consequence of evolutionary process."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And in some sense, the purpose of evolution is survival."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And then the, this complicated optimization objective baked into us, let's say compression, which might help us operate in the real world and it baked into us various reward functions."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Then to be clear at the moment we are operating in the regime, which is somewhat out of distribution, where they even evolution optimized us."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "It's almost like love is a consequence of a cooperation that we've discovered is useful."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "In some way it's even the case."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "If you, I just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Or it's not out of distribution."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "It's like, as you said, it evolved for cooperation."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "So there is, we are wired actually even for love."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And at the moment, I guess, the, maybe it would be somewhat more beneficial if you will, if we would identify ourselves with all the humanity as a whole."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "So you can clearly see when people travel around the world, when they run into person from the same country, they say, oh, which CPR and all this, like all the sudden they find all these similarities."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "They find some, they befriended those folks earlier than others."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "So there is like a sense, some sense of the belonging."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "And I would say, I think it would be overall good thing to the world for people to move towards, I think it's even called open individualism, move toward the mindset of a larger and larger groups."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So the challenge there, that's a beautiful vision and I share it to expand that circle of empathy, that circle of love towards the entirety of humanity."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "But then you start to ask, well, where do you draw the line?"}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Because why not expand it to other conscious beings?"}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And then finally, for our discussion, something I think about is why not expand it to AI systems?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Like we, we start respecting each other when the, the person, the entity on the other side has the capacity to suffer."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Cause then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And so I could see AI systems that are interacting with humans more and more having conscious, like displays."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "So like they display consciousness through language and through other means."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And so then the question is like, well, is that consciousness?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Because they're acting conscious."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so, you know, the reason we don't like torturing animals is because they look like they're suffering when they're tortured and if AI looks like it's suffering when it's tortured, how is that not requiring of the same kind of empathy from us and respect and rights that animals do and other humans do?"}, {"time": 3215, "text": "I think it requires empathy as well."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "I mean, I would like, I guess us or humanity or so make a progress in understanding what consciousness is, because I don't want just to be speaking about that, the philosophy, but rather actually make a scientific, uh, to have a, like, you know, there was a time that people thought that there is a force of life and, uh, the things that have this force, they are alive."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "And, um, I think that there is actually a path to understand exactly what consciousness is and how it works."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "Understand exactly what consciousness is."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "And, uh, um, in some sense, it might require essentially putting probes inside of a human brain, uh, what Neuralink, uh, does."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "So the goal there, I mean, there's several things with consciousness that make it a real discipline, which is one is rigorous measurement of consciousness."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "And then the other is the engineering of consciousness, which may or may not be related."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "I mean, you could also run into trouble."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Like, for example, in the United States for the department, DOT, department of transportation, and a lot of different places put a value on human life."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "I think DOT is, uh, values $9 million per person."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Sort of in that same way, you can get into trouble."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "If you put a number on how conscious of being is, because then you can start making policy, if a cow is a 0.1 or like, um, 10% as conscious as a human, then you can start making calculations and it might get you into trouble."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "But then again, that might be a very good way to do it."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "I would like, uh, to move to that place that actually we have scientific understanding what consciousness is."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "And then we'll be able to actually assign value."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "And I believe that there is even the path for the experimentation in it."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "So, uh, you know, w we said that, you know, you could put the probes inside of the brain."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "There is actually a few other things that you could do with devices like Neuralink."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "So you could imagine that the way even to measure if AI system is conscious is by literally just plugging into the brain."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Um, I mean, that, that seems like it's kind of easy, but the plugging into the brain and asking person if they feel that their consciousness expanded, um, this direction of course has some issues."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "You can say, you know, if someone takes a psychedelic drug, they might feel that their consciousness expanded, even though that drug itself is not conscious."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "So like, you can't fully trust the self report of a person saying their, their consciousness is expanded or not."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Let me ask you a little bit about psychedelics is, uh, there've been a lot of excellent research on, uh, different psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, even DMT drugs in general, marijuana too."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "Uh, what do you think psychedelics do to the human mind?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "It seems they take the human mind to some interesting places."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Is that just a little, uh, hack, a visual hack, or is there some profound expansion of the mind?"}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So let's see, I don't believe in magic."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "I believe in, uh, I believe in, uh, in science in, in causality, um, still, let's say, and then as I said, like, I think that the brain, that the, our subjective experience of reality is, uh, we live in the simulation run by our brain and the simulation that our brain runs, they can be very pleasant or very hellish drugs, they are changing some hyper parameters of the simulation."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "It is possible thanks to change of these hyper parameters to actually look back on your experience and even see that the given things that we took for granted, they are changeable."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So they allow to have a amazing perspective."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "There is also, for instance, the fact that after DMT people can see the full movie inside of their head, gives me further belief that the brain can generate that full movie, that the brain is actually learning the model of reality to such extent that it tries to predict what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Very high resolution."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "So it can replay reality."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Extremely high resolution."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "It's also kind of interesting to me that somehow there seems to be some similarity between these, uh, drugs and meditation itself."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "And I actually started even these days to think about meditation as a psychedelic."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "Do you practice meditation?"}, {"time": 3504, "text": "I practice meditation."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "I mean, I went a few times on the retreats and it feels after like after second or third day of meditation, uh, there is a, there is almost like a sense of, you know, tripping what, what does the meditation retreat entail?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "So you w you wake up early in the morning and you meditate for extended period of time, uh, and yeah, so it's optimized, even though there are other people, it's optimized for isolation."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "So you don't speak with anyone."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "You don't actually look into other people's eyes and, uh, you know, you sit on the chair and say Vipassana meditation tells you, uh, to focus on the breath."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "So you try to put, uh, all the, all attention into breathing and, uh, breathing in and breathing out."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "And the crazy thing is that as you focus attention like that, uh, after some time, their stems starts coming back, like some memories that you completely forgotten, it almost feels like, uh, that you'll have a mailbox and then you know, you are just like a archiving email one by one."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "And at some point, at some point there is this like a amazing feeling of getting to mailbox zero, zero emails."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "And, uh, it's very pleasant."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "Are you, what are you experiencing?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Are you just

but it's also somehow the extended meditation takes you to the space that they are way more friendly, way more positive."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Um, there is also this, uh, this thing that, uh, we've, it almost feels that the."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "It almost feels that the, we are constantly getting a little bit of a reward function and we are just spreading this reward function on various activities."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "But if you'll stay still for extended period of time, it kind of accumulates, accumulates, accumulates, and, uh, there is a, there is a sense, there is a sense that some point it passes some threshold and it feels as drop is falling into kind of ocean of love and this, and that's like, uh, this is like a very pleasant."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And that's, I'm saying like, uh, that corresponds to the subjective experience."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Some people, uh, I guess in spiritual community, they describe it that that's the reality, and I would say, I believe that they're like, uh, all sorts of subjective experience that one can have."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "And, uh, I believe that for instance, meditation might take you to the subjective experiences with the subject."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Vision might take you to the subjective experiences, which are very pleasant, collaborative."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "And I would like a word to move toward a more collaborative, uh, uh, place."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "I would say that's very pleasant and I enjoy doing stuff like that."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "So something similar, how I'm thinking about this."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "So I told you that there is this like, uh, that there is a story of who you are."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And I think almost about it

therefore you can say that the, or you're having a, your, or like a, your brain attempts to simulate the reward function of everyone else or like everything that's that there is this like a love,

be very unpleasant."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And in some sense, even the difficulty, it's not even in the lack of being able to speak with others, like, uh, you're sitting there, your legs will hurt

just, just observe it."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "And then at some point it just becomes, uh, it just is, it's like, uh, I remember that we've, Ilya told me some time ago that, uh, you know, he takes

consciousness, uh, life AI, but, uh, in terms of the, it's interesting to me, cause you're a brilliant, uh, Thinker in the space of machine learning, like intuition, like digging deep in what works, what doesn't, why it works, why it doesn't, and so is Ilya."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "I'm wondering if there's interesting deep discussions you've had with him in the past or disagreements that were

realized that maybe my super skill, um, is, uh, being able to bring people to collaborate together, that I have some level of empathy that is unique in AI world."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "And that might come, you know, from either meditation, psychedelics, or let's say I read just hundreds of books on this topic."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So, and I also went through a journey of, you know, I developed a lot of, uh, algorithms, so I think that maybe I can, that's my super human skill."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Uh, Ilya is, uh, one of the best AI scientists, but then I'm pretty good in

a research managers."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "So you, you find, you find places where you're excellent and he finds like his, his, his deep scientific insights is where he is and you find ways you can, the puzzle pieces fit together."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Like, uh, you know, ultimately, for instance, let's say Ilya, he doesn't manage people, uh, that's not what he likes or so."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Um, I like, I like hanging out with people."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "By default, I'm an extrovert and I care about people."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So that, that fits perfectly together."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "But I mean, uh, I also just like your intuition about various problems in machine learning."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "He's definitely one I really enjoy."},

model for pedestrians, like through self play, all that kind of mechanisms, the depth of thought on a particular problem, especially problems he doesn't know anything about is, is fascinating to watch."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "It makes you realize like, um, yeah, the, the, the limits of the, that the human intellect may be limitless, or it's just impressive to see a descendant of ape come up with clever ideas."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "I mean, so even in the space of deep learning, when you look at various people, there are people now who invented some breakthroughs once, but there are very few people who did it multiple times."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "And you can think if someone invented it once, that might be just a sheer luck."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And if someone invented it multiple times, you know, if a probability of inventing it once is one over a million, then probability of inventing it twice or three times would be one over a million square or, or to the power of three, which, which would be just impossible."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So it literally means that it's, it's given that, uh, it's not the luck."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "And Ilya is one of these few people who, uh, uh, who have, uh, a lot of these inventions in his arsenal."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "It also feels that, um, you know, for instance, if you think about folks like Gauss or Euler, uh, you know, at first they read a lot of books and then they did thinking and then they figure out math and that's how it feels with Ilya, you know, at first he read stuff and then like he spent his thinking cycles."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And that's a really good way to put it."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "When I talk to him, I, I see thinking."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "He's actually thinking, like, he makes me realize that there's like deep thinking that the human mind can do."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "Like most of us are not thinking deeply."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "Uh, like you really have to put in a lot of effort to think deeply."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Like I have to really put myself in a place where I think deeply about a problem, it takes a lot of effort."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "It's like, uh, it's like an airplane taking off or something."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "You have to achieve deep focus."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "He he's just, uh, he's what is it?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "He said, what does it, his brain is like a vertical takeoff in terms of airplane analogy."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "So it's interesting, but it, I mean, Cal Newport talks about this as ideas of deep work."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "It's, you know, most of us don't work much at all in terms of like, like deeply think about particular problems, whether it's a math engineering, all that kind of stuff, you want to go to that place often and that's real hard work."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And some of us are better than others at that."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So I think that the big piece has to do with actually even engineering your environment that says that it's conducive to that."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "So, um, see both Ilya and I, uh, on the frequent basis, we kind of disconnect ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "So Ilya usually, he just, uh, leaves iPad at hand."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "He loves his iPad."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And, uh, for me, I'm even sometimes, you know, just going for a few days to different location to Airbnb, I'm turning off my phone and there is no access to me and, uh, that's extremely important for me to be able to actually just formulate new thoughts, to do deep work rather than to be reactive."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "And the, the, the older I am, the more of these random tasks are at hand."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Before I go on to that, uh, thread, let me return to our friend, GPT."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And let me ask you another ridiculously big question."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "Can you give an overview of what GPT three is, or like you say in your Twitter bio, GPT N plus one, how it works and why it works."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "So, um, GPT three is a humongous neural network."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "Um, let's assume that we know what is neural network, the definition, and it is trained on the entire internet and just to predict next word."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "So let's say it sees part of the, uh, article and it, the only task that it has at hand, it is to say what would be the next word and what would be the next word and it becomes a really exceptional at the task of figuring out what's the next word."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So you might ask, why would, uh, this be an important, uh, task?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Why would it be important to predict what's the next word?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "And it turns out that a lot of problems, uh, can be formulated, uh, as a text completion problem."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So GPT is purely, uh, learning to complete the text."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "And you could imagine, for instance, if you are asking a question, uh, who is the president of the United States, then GPT can give you an answer to it."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "It turns out that many more things can be formulated this way."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "You can format text in the way that you have sentence in English."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You make it even look like some content of a website, uh, elsewhere, which would be teaching people how to translate things between languages."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "So it would be EN colon, uh, text in English, FR colon, and then you'll uh, uh, and then you'll ask people and then you ask model to, to continue."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "And it turns out that the, such a model is predicting translation from English to French."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "The crazy thing is that this model can be used for way more sophisticated tasks."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So you can format text such that it looks like a conversation between two people."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And that might be a conversation between you and Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And because the model read all the texts about Elon Musk, it will be able to predict Elon Musk words as it would be Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "It will speak about colonization of Mars, about sustainable future and so on."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "And it's also possible to, to even give arbitrary personality to the model."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "You can say, here is a conversation that we've a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And the model, uh, will complete the text as a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "So, I mean, how do I express how amazing this is?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "So just to clarify, uh, a conversation, generating a conversation between me and Elon Musk, it wouldn't just generate good examples of what Elon would say."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "It would get the same results as the conversation between Elon Musk and me."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Say it would get the syntax all correct."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "So like interview style, it would say like Elon call and Lex call, like it, it's not just like, uh, inklings of, um, semantic correctness."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's like the whole thing, grammatical, syntactic, semantic, it's just really, really impressive, uh, generalization."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "I mean, I also want to, you know, provide some caveats so it can generate few paragraphs of coherent text, but as you go to, uh, longer pieces, it, uh, it actually goes off the rails."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "If you try to write a book, it won't work out this way."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "What way does it go off the rails, by the way?"}, {"time": 4727, "text": "Is there interesting ways in which it goes off the rails?"}, {"time": 4730, "text": "Like what falls apart first?"}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So the model is trained on the, all the existing data, uh, that is out there, which means that it is not trained on its own mistakes."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "So for instance, if it would make a mistake, then, uh, I kept, so to give you, give you an example."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "So let's say I have a conversation with a model pretending that is Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "And then I start putting some, uh, I'm start actually making up things which are not factual."},

will just keep on carrying it on."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And as if it's true."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And in some sense, if you would have a normal conversation with Elon, he would be what the fuck."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "There'll be some feedback between, so the model is trained on things that humans have written, but through the generation process, there's no human in the loop feedback."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So it's magnified."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "It's like the errors get magnified and magnified and it's also interesting."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "I mean, first of all, humans have the same problem."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "It's just that we, uh, we'll make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "I think that actually what happens with humans is if you have a wrong belief about the world as a kid, then very quickly we'll learn that it's not correct because they are grounded in reality and they are learning from your new

the absence of Elon Musk being your wife information on the internet, won't it correct itself?"}, {"time": 4843, "text": "There won't be examples like that."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So the errors will be subtle at first."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "Subtle at first."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "And in some sense, you can also say that the data that is not out there is the data, which would represent how the human learns and maybe model would be learned, trained on such a data."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "Then it would be better off."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "How intelligent is GPT3 do you think?"}, {"time": 4866, "text": "Like when you think about the nature of intelligence, it seems exceptionally impressive."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "But then if you think about the big AGI problem, is this footsteps along the way to AGI?"}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So let's see, it seems that intelligence itself is, there are multiple axis of it."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And I would expect that the systems that we are building, they might end up being superhuman on some axis and subhuman on some other axis."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "It would be surprising to me on all axis simultaneously, they would become superhuman."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "Of course, people ask this question, is GPT a spaceship that would take us to the moon or are we putting a, building a ladder to heaven that we are just building bigger and bigger ladder."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "And we don't know in some sense, which one of these two."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "Which one is better?"}, {"time": 4922, "text": "I'm trying to, I like stairway to heaven."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "It's a good song."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "So I'm not exactly sure which one is better, but you're saying like the spaceship to the moon is actually effective."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "So people who criticize GPT, they say, you guys just building a taller, a ladder, and it will never reach the moon."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "And at the moment, I would say the way I'm thinking is, is like a scientific question."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And I'm also in heart, I'm a builder creator and like, I'm thinking, let's try out, let's see how far it goes."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "And so far we see constantly that there is a progress."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So do you think GPT four, GPT five, GPT N plus one will, um, there'll be a phase shift, like a transition to a, to a place where we'll be truly surprised."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "Then again, like GPT three is already very like truly surprising."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "The people that criticize GPT three as a stair, as a, what is it?"}, {"time": 4984, "text": "Ladder to heaven."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "I think too quickly get accustomed to how impressive it is that they're impressive, it is that the prediction of the next word can achieve such depth of semantics, accuracy of syntax, grammar, and semantics."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Um, do you, do you think GPT four and five and six will continue to surprise us?"}, {"time": 5008, "text": "I mean, definitely there will be more impressive models that there is a question of course, if there will be a phase shift and, uh, the, also even the way I'm thinking about the, about these models is that when we build these models, you know, we see some level of the capabilities, but we don't even fully understand everything that the model can do."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "And actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to probe the model to even see what is possible."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "Hence the, the using GPT as an API and opening it up to the world."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "I mean, so when I'm thinking from perspective of like, uh, obviously various people are, that have concerns about AGI, including myself."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Um, and then when I'm thinking from perspective, what's the strategy even to deploy these things to the world, then the one strategy that I have seen many times working is that iterative deployment that you deploy, um, slightly better versions and you allow other people to criticize you."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "So you actually, or try it out, you see where are their fundamental issues."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "And it's almost, you don't want to be in that situation that you are holding into powerful system and there's like a huge overhang, then you deploy it and it might have a random chaotic impact on the world."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So you actually want to be in

problem and thinking about the worst case consequences."}, {"time": 5417, "text": "So I think that is true."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "I mean, the, what I also recognize in myself and others even asking this question is that it evokes a lot of fear and fear itself ends up being actually quite debilitating."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "The place where I arrived at the moment might sound cheesy or so, but it's almost to build things out of love rather than fear, like a focus on how, uh, I can, you know, maximize the value, how the systems that I'm building might be, uh, useful."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "I'm not saying that the fear doesn't exist out there and like it totally makes sense to minimize it, but I don't want to be working because, uh, I'm scared, I want to be working out of passion, out of curiosity, out of the, you know, uh, looking forward for the positive future."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "With, uh, the definition of love arising from a rigorous practice of empathy."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "So not just like your own conception of what is good for the world, but always listening to others."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Like the love where I'm considering reward functions of others."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "Others to limit to infinity is like a sum of like one to N where N is, uh, 7 billion or whatever it is."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "Not, not projecting my reward functions on others."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Can we just take a step back to something else?"}, {"time": 5503, "text": "Super cool, which is, uh, OpenAI Codex."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Can you give an overview of what OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot is, how it works and why the hell it works so well?"}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So with GPT tree, we noticed that the system, uh, you know, that system train on all the language out there started having some rudimentary coding capabilities."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "So we're able to ask it, you know, to implement addition function between two numbers and indeed it can write item or JavaScript code for that."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "And then we thought, uh, we might as well just go full steam ahead and try to create a system that is actually good at what we are doing every day ourselves, which is programming."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "We optimize models for proficiency in coding."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "We actually even created models that both have a comprehension of language and code."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "And Codex is API for these models."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "So it's first pre trained on language and then codex."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "Then I don't know if you can say fine tuned because there's a lot of code, but it's language and code."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "It's language and code."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "It's also optimized for various things."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "I can, let's say low latency and so on."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Codex is the API, the similar to GPT tree."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "We expect that there will be proliferation of the potential products that can use coding capabilities and I can, I can speak about it in a second."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "Copilot is a first product and developed by GitHub."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "So as we're building, uh, models, we wanted to make sure that these models are useful and we work together with GitHub on building the first product."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "Copilot is actually, as you code, it suggests you code completions."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "And we have seen in the past, there are like a various tools that can suggest how to like a few characters of the code or a line of code."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "Then the thing about Copilot is it can generate 10 lines of code."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "You, it's often the way how it works is you often write in the comment what you want to happen because people in comments, they describe what happens next."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So, um, these days when I code, instead of going to Google to search, uh, for the appropriate code to solve my problem, I say, Oh, for this area, could you smooth it and then, you know, it imports some appropriate libraries and say it uses NumPy convolution or so I, that I was not even aware that exists and it does the appropriate thing."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Um, so you, uh, you write a comment, maybe the header of a function and it completes the function."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Of course, you don't know what is the space of all the possible small programs that can generate."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "What are the failure cases?"}, {"time": 5670, "text": "How many edge cases, how many subtle errors there are, how many big errors there are, it's hard to know, but the fact that it works at all in a large number of cases is incredible."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "It's like, uh, it's a kind of search engine into code that's been written on the internet."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "So for instance, when you search things online, then usually you get to the, some particular case, like if you go to stack overflow and people describe that one particular situation, uh, and then they seek for a solution."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "But in case of a copilot, it's aware of your entire context and in context is, Oh, these are the libraries that they are using."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "That's the set of the variables that is initialized."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "And on the spot, it can actually tell you what to do."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "So the interesting thing is, and we think that the copilot is one possible product using codecs, but there is a place for many more."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "So internally we tried out, you know, to create other fun products."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So it turns out that a lot of tools out there, let's say Google calendar or Microsoft word or so, they all have a internal API to build plugins around them."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or Microsoft word."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Today, if you want, if you want more complicated behaviors from these programs, you have to add the new button for every behavior."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "But it is possible to use codecs and tell for instance, to calendar, uh, could you schedule an appointment with Lex next week after 2 PM and it writes corresponding piece of code."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "And that's the thing that actually you want."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "So you figure out is there's a lot of programs with which you can interact through code."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And so there you can generate that code from natural language."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And that's somewhat like also closest to what was the promise of Siri or Alexa."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So previously all these behaviors, they were hard coded and it seems that codecs on the fly can pick up the API of let's say, given software."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And then it can turn language into use of this API."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So without hard coding, you can find, it can translate to machine language."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "To, uh, so for example, this would be really exciting for me, like for, um, Adobe products, like Photoshop, uh, which I think action scripted, I think there's a scripting language that communicates with them, same with Premier."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "And do you could imagine that that allows even to do coding by voice on your phone?"}, {"time": 5826, "text": "So for instance, in the past, okay."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "As of today, I'm not editing Word documents on my phone because it's just the keyboard is too small."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "But if I would be able to tell, uh, to my phone, you know, uh, make the header large, then move the paragraphs around and that's actually what I want."}, {"time": 5845, "text": "So I can tell you one more cool thing, or even how I'm thinking about codecs."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So if you look actually at the evolution of, uh, of computers, we started with a very primitive interfaces, which is a punch card and punch card."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So Charlie, you make a holes in the, in the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And, uh, during that time, there was a small number of specialists who were able to use computers."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And by the way, people even suspected that there is no need for many more people to use computers."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Um, but then we moved from punch cards to at first assembly and see, and at these programming languages, they were slightly higher level."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "They allowed many more people to code and they also, uh, led to more of a proliferation of technology."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And, uh, you know, further on, there was a jump to say from C++ to Java and Python."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "And every time it has happened, more people are able to code and we build more technology."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "And it's even, you know, hard to imagine now, if someone will tell you that you should write code in assembly instead of let's say, Python or Java or JavaScript."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "And codecs is yet another step toward kind of bringing computers closer to humans such that you communicate with a computer with your own language rather than with a specialized language, and, uh, I think that it will lead to an increase of number of people who can code."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "And then, and the kind of technologies that those people will create is it's innumerable, it could, you know, it could be a huge number of technologies."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "We're not predicting at all because that's less and less requirement of having a technical mind, a programming mind, you're not opening it to the world of, um, other kinds of minds, creative minds, artistic minds, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "I would like, for instance, biologists who work on DNA to be able to program and not to need to spend a lot of time learning it."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "And I, I believe that's a good thing to the world."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "And I would actually add, I would add, so at the moment I'm a managing codecs team and also language team, and I believe that there is like a plenty of brilliant people out there and they should have a lot of experience."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "There and they should apply."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "So what's the language and the codecs is, so those are kind of, they're overlapping teams."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "It's like GPT, the raw language, and then the codecs is like applied to programming."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "And they are quite intertwined."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "There are many more things involved making this, uh, models, uh, extremely efficient and deployable."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "For instance, there are people who are working to, you know, make our data centers, uh, amazing, or there are people who work on putting these models into production or, uh, or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So all aspects from, from the infrastructure to the actual machine."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "So I'm just saying there are multiple teams while the, and the team working on codecs and language, uh, I guess I'm, I'm directly managing them."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "I would like, I would love to hire more interested in machine learning."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "This is probably one of the most exciting problems and like systems to be working on is it's actually, it's, it's, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "Like what, what, uh, the program synthesis, like generating a programs is very interesting, very interesting problem that has echoes of reasoning and intelligence in it."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It's and I think there's a lot of fundamental questions that you might be able to sneak, uh, sneak up to by generating programs."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "Yeah, that one more exciting thing about the programs is that, so I said that the, um, you know, the, in case of language, that one of the travels is even evaluating language."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "So when the things are made up, you, you need somehow either a human to, to say that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program, there is one extra lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So that process might be somewhat, uh, more automated in, in order to improve the, uh, qualities of generations."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "So like the, wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "So, so for the language, the, you know, the simulation to actually execute it as a human mind."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "For programs, there is a, there is a computer on which you can evaluate it."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "That's a brilliant little insight."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "Insight that the thing compiles and runs that's first and second, you can evaluate on a, like do automated unit testing and in some sense, it seems to me that we'll be able to make a tremendous progress."}, {"time": 6132, "text": "You know, we are in the paradigm that there is way more data."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "There is like a transcription of millions of, uh, of, uh, software engineers."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "So, uh, I mean, you just mean, cause I was going to ask you about reliability."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "The thing about programs is you don't know if they're going to, like a program that's controlling a nuclear power plant has to be very reliable."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "So I wouldn't start with controlling nuclear power plant maybe one day, but that's not actually, that's not on the current roadmap."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "That's not the step one."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And you know, it's the Russian thing."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "You just want to go to the most powerful, destructive, most powerful the most powerful, destructive thing right away run by JavaScript."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "But I got you."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "So this is a lower impact, but nevertheless, when you make me realize it is possible to achieve some levels of reliability by doing testing."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "And you could, you could imagine that, you know, maybe there are ways for model to write event code for testing itself and so on, and there exists a ways to create the feedback loops that the model could keep on improving."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "By writing programs that generate tests for the instance, for instance."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And that's how we get consciousness, because it's metacompression."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "That's what you're going to write."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "That's the comment."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "That's the prompt that generates consciousness."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "Compressor of compressors."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "You just write that."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Do you think the code that generates consciousness will be simple?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "I mean, ultimately, the core idea behind will be simple, but there will be also decent amount of engineering involved."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "Like in some sense, it seems that, you know, spreading these models on many machines, it's not that trivial."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And we find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I believe that first models that I guess are conscious or like a truly intelligent, they will have all sorts of tricks, but then again, there's a Richard Sutton argument that maybe the tricks are temporary things that they might be temporary things and in some sense, it's also even important to, to know that even the cost of a trick."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "So sometimes people are eager to put the trick while forgetting that there is a cost of maintenance or like a long term cost, long term cost or maintenance, or maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "So even if you have something that gives you 2x, but it requires, you know, 1000 lines of code, I'm not sure if it's actually worth it."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So in some sense, you know, if it's five lines of code and 2x, I would take it."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And we see many of this, but also, you know, that requires some level of, I guess, lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "So you led the OpenAI robotics team."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Can you give an overview of the cool things you were able to accomplish, what are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6322, "text": "So when we started robotics, we knew that actually reinforcement learning works and it is possible to solve fairly complicated problems."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "Like for instance, AlphaGo is an evidence that it is possible to build superhuman Go players, DOTA2 is an evidence that it's possible to build superhuman agents playing DOTA, so I asked myself a question, you know, what about robots out there?"}, {"time": 6348, "text": "Could we train machines to solve arbitrary tasks in the physical world?"}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Our approach was, I guess, let's pick a complicated problem that if we would solve it, that means that we made some significant progress in the domain."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And if can progress the domain, and then we went after the problem."}, {"time": 6368, "text": "So we noticed that actually the robots out there, they are kind of at the moment optimized per task, so you can have a robot that it's like, if you have a robot opening a bottle, it's very likely that the end factor is that bottle opener."}, {"time": 6384, "text": "And the, and in some sense, that's a hack to be able to solve a task, which makes any task easier and ask myself, so what would be a robot that can actually solve many tasks?"}, {"time": 6395, "text": "And we conclude that human hands have such a quality that indeed they are, you know, you have five kind of tiny arms attached individually."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "They can manipulate pretty broad spectrum of objects."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "So we went after a single hand, like trying to solve Rubik's cube single handed."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "We picked this task because we thought that there is no way to hard code it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it's also, we picked the robot on which it would be hard to hard code it."}, {"time": 6425, "text": "And we went after the solution such that it could generalize to other problems."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "And just to clarify, it's one robotic hand solving the Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "The hard part isn't the solution to the Rubik's cube is the manipulation of the, of like having it not fall out of the hand, having it use the, uh, five baby arms to, uh, what is it like rotate different parts of the Rubik's cube to achieve the solution."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part about that?"}, {"time": 6458, "text": "What was the approach taken there?"}, {"time": 6460, "text": "What are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6461, "text": "Obviously we have like a strong belief in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And, uh, you know, one path it is to do reinforcement learning, the real world other path is to, uh, uh, that simulation in some sense, the tricky part about the real world is at the moment, our models, they require a lot of data and there is essentially no data."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And, uh, I did, we decided to go through the path of the simulation."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And in simulation, you can have infinite amount of data."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "The tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And also can you in simulation represent everything that you represent otherwise in the real world."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "How do you generate the different simulations?"}, {"time": 6531, "text": "So, uh, you know, there's plenty of parameters out there."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "We just pick them randomly."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "And, uh, and in simulation model just goes for thousands of years and keeps on solving Rubik's cube in each of them."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And the thing is that neural network that we used, it has a memory."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And as it presses, for instance, the side of the, of the cube, it can sense, oh, that's actually, this side was, uh, difficult to press."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "There's probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "Um, so maybe, uh, put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you'll know exactly what, uh, what Jack is talking about."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work?"}, {"time": 6624, "text": "So the hardest part is at the moment when it comes to, uh, physical work, when it comes to robots, uh, they require maintenance, it's hard to replicate a million times it's, uh, it's also, it's hard to replay things exactly."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "I remember this situation that one guy at our company, he had like a model that performs way better than other models in solving Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "And, uh, you know, we kind of didn't know what's going on, why it's that."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "And, uh, it turned out, uh, that, you know, he was running it from his laptop that had better CPU or better, maybe local GPU as well."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And, uh, because of that, there was less of a latency and the model was the same."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "And that actually made solving Rubik's cube more reliable."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So in some sense, there might be some subtle bugs like that when it comes to running things in the real world."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "Even hinting on that, you could imagine that the initial models you would like to have models, which are insanely huge neural networks, and you would like to give them even more time for thinking."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "And when you have these real time systems, uh, then you might be constrained actually by the amount of latency."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "And, uh, ultimately I would like to build a system that it is worth for you to wait five minutes because it gives you the answer that you're willing to wait for five minutes."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "So latency is a very unpleasant constraint under which to operate."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "And also there is actually one more thing, which is tricky about robots."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "Uh, there is actually, uh, no, uh, not much data."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "So the data that I'm speaking about would be a data of, uh, first person experience from the robot and like a gigabytes of data like that, if we would have gigabytes of data like that, of robots solving various problems, it would be very easy to make a progress on robotics."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "And you can see that in case of text or code, there is a lot of data, like a first person perspective, they don't writing code."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "So you would invest, that's just one way to do it, invest in human supervision, like direct human control of the robots as it's learning and over time, add more and more automation."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So let's say that's how I would build a robotics company today."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "If I would be building a robotics company, which is, you know, spend 10 million dollars or so recording human trajectories, controlling a robot."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "After you find a thing that the robot should be doing, that there's a market fit for, like you can make a lot of money with that product."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "Uh, so I would record data and then I would essentially train supervised learning model on it."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "That might be the path today."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "I think that actually what is needed is to have a robot that can train powerful models over video."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So, um, you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like Dali and people are looking into models, generating videos, they're like, uh, bodies, algorithmic questions, even how to do it."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "And it's unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose, but, uh, I, I suspect that the models that which would have a level of understanding of video, same as GPT has a level of understanding of text, could be used, uh, to train robots to solve tasks."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "They would have a lot of common sense."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "If one day, I'm pretty sure one day there will be a robotics company by robotics company, I mean, the primary source of income is, is from robots that is worth over $1 trillion."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "What do you think that company will do?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "I think self driving cars."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "No, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "Cause my mind went to personal robotics, robots in the home."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "It seems like there's much more market opportunity there."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "I think it's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "I mean, this, this, this might speak to something important, which is I understand self driving much better than understand robotics in the home."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "So I understand how difficult it is to actually solve self driving to a, to a level, not just the actual computer vision and the control problem and just the basic problem of self driving, but creating a product that would undeniably be, um, that will cost less money."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "Like it will save you a lot of money, like orders of magnitude, less money that could replace Uber drivers, for example."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "So car sharing that's autonomous, that creates a similar or better experience in terms of how quickly you get from A to B or just whatever, the pleasantness of the experience, the efficiency of the experience, the value of the experience, and at the same time, the car itself costs cheaper."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "I think that's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "I think there's a lot more, um, low hanging fruit in the home."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "That, that, that could be, I also want to give you a perspective on like how challenging it would be at home or like it maybe kind of depends on that exact problem that you'd be solving."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Like if we're speaking about these robotic arms and hands, these things, they cost tens of thousands of

uh, AI system with some embodiment, I think."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "So the tricky part when you think actually what's the difficult part is, um, when the robot has like, when there is a diversity of the environment with which the robot has to interact, that becomes hard."}, {"time": 7051, "text": "So, you know, on the one spectrum, you have, uh, industrial robots as they are doing over and over the same thing, it is possible to some extent to prescribe the movements and we've very small amount of intelligence, the, the movement can be repeated millions of times."}, {"time": 7068, "text": "Um, the, it, there are also, you know, various pieces of industrial robots where it becomes harder and harder."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "I can, for instance, in case of Tesla, it might be a matter of putting a, a rack inside of a car and, you know, because the rack kind of moves around, it's, uh, it's not that easy."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "It's not exactly the same every time."},

you try to avoid even interacting with things."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "You are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "And then if you would have in

relatively simple."}, {"time": 7135, "text": "So to both agree and to push back."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "So you're referring to touch, like soft robotics, like the actual touch, but."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "I would argue that you could formulate just basic interaction between, um, like non contact interaction is also a kind of touch and that might be very difficult to solve that's the basic, this not disagreement, but that's the basic open question to me with self driving cars and this agreement with Elon, which is how much interaction is required to solve self driving cars."},

7214, "text": "Uh, but then at least in case of Tesla, you can't just at least in case of Tesla, they are gathering data from people driving their cars and I believe that's an example of supervised data that they can train their models, uh, on, and they are doing it, uh, which, you know, can give a model dislike, uh, another level of, uh, of, uh, behavior that is needed to actually interact with the real world."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "It's interesting how much data is required to achieve that."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "Um, w what do you think of the whole Tesla autopilot approach, the computer vision based approach with multiple cameras and there's a data engine."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "It's a multitask, multiheaded neural network, and it's this fascinating process of, uh, similar to what you're talking about with the robotics approach, uh, which is, you know, you deploy in your own network and then there's humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch of places and that stuff is sent back."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So like the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge cases are sent back for supervised annotation, thereby improving the neural network and that's deployed again."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "It goes over and over until the network becomes really good at the task of driving becomes safer and safer."}, {"time": 7291,

you know, collecting trajectories from humans, that's like a first step and then you deploy the system and then you have humans revising the, all the issues."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "And in some sense, like at this approach converges to system that doesn't make mistakes because for the cases where there are mistakes, you got their data, how to fix them and the system will keep on improving."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So there's a very, to me, difficult question of how hard that, you know, how long that converging takes, how hard it is."}, {"time": 7324, "text": "The other aspect of autonomous vehicles, this probably applies to certain robotics applications is society, right?"}, {"time": 7332, "text": "They put as, as the quality of the system converges."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "So one, there's a human factors perspective of psychology of humans being able to supervise those even with teleoperation, those robots."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And the other is

7355, "text": "So the bar is set much higher than for humans."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And so if there's a death in an autonomous vehicle, that's seen as a much more, much more dramatic than a death in the human driven vehicle."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "Part of the success of deployment of robots is figuring out how to make robots part of society, both on the, just the human side, on the media side, on the media journalist side, and also on the policy government side."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "And that seems to be, maybe you can put that into the objective function to optimize, but that is, that is definitely a tricky one."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "And I wonder if that is actually the trickiest part for self driving cars or any system that's safety critical."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "It's not the algorithm, it's the society accepting it."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "Yeah, I would say, I believe that the part of the process of deployment is actually showing people that the given things can be trusted and, you know, trust is also like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it and damage it."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "And I think that's actually very common with, with innovation, that there's some resistance toward it and it's just the natural progression."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So in some sense, people will have to keep on proving that indeed these systems are worth being used."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "And I would say, I also found out that often the best way to convince people is by letting them experience it."}, {"time": 7452, "text":

Copilot."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "There was a spectrum of responses that people had."}, {"time": 7494, "text": "And ultimately the important piece was to let people try it out."}, {"time": 7500,

fear."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "But then you try it out and you think, actually, that's cool."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "And, you know, you can try to resist the same way as, you know, you could

what happens."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "And I mean, in some sense, that's actually what happens over the years in AI that like, we get used to things very quickly."}, {"time": 7610, "text": "You know something, I talked to Rodney Brooks."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "He called AlphaZero homework problem."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "Cause he was saying like, there's nothing special about it."},
