{"time": 341, "text": "They will meter out their lessons of difficulty all the same."}, {"time": 345, "text": "And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question, why do we sleep?"}, {"time": 350, "text": "But in truth, 20 years later, we've had to upend the question rather than saying, why do we sleep?"}, {"time": 357, "text": "And by the way, the answer then was that we sleep to cure sleepiness, which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger."}, {"time": 367, "text": "That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits of food, same with sleep."}, {"time": 371, "text": "Now we've actually have to ask the question, is there any physiological system in the body or any major operation of the mind that isn't wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough?"}, {"time": 385, "text": "And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no."}, {"time": 389, "text": "So far, the answer seems to be no."}, {"time": 392, "text": "So why does the body and the mind crave sleep?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "Crave sleep then?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "How can we begin to answer that question then?"}, {"time": 405, "text": "So I think one of the ways that I think about this or one of the answers that came to me is the following."}, {"time": 413, "text": "The reason that we implode so quickly and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep is because human beings seem to be one of the few species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent good reason, biological."}, {"time": 426, "text": "And what that led me then to was the following."}, {"time": 431, "text": "Mother nature as a consequence."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So no other species does what we do in that context."}, {"time": 437, "text": "There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation, but for very obvious, clear biological reasons."}, {"time": 444, "text": "One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation."}, {"time": 447, "text": "The second is when they're caring for their newborn."}, {"time": 450, "text": "So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves."}, {"time": 454, "text": "The female will go away from the pod, give birth, and then bring the calf back."}, {"time": 459, "text": "And during that time, the mother will undergo sleep deprivation."}, {"time": 463, "text": "And then the third one is during migration when birds are flying trans oceanographic 2,000, 3,000 miles."}, {"time": 471, "text": "But for the most part, it's never seen in the animal kingdom, which brings me back to the point, therefore mother nature in the course of evolution has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation."}, {"time": 485, "text": "And therefore she has never created a safety net in place to circumnavigate this common influence."}, {"time": 495, "text": "And there is a good example where we have, which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Because during our evolutionary past, we had famine and we had feast."}, {"time": 506, "text": "And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe, which is how can I store caloric credit so that I can spend it when I go into debt?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea."}, {"time": 519, "text": "Where is the fat cell for sleep?"}, {"time": 522, "text": "Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?"}, {"time": 524, "text": "And unfortunately we don't seem to have one because she's never had to face that challenge."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So even if there's not some kind of physics, fundamental need for sleep that physiologically or psychologically, the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism for sleep deprivation."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So it's interesting that why we sleep might not have a good answer, but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true."}, {"time": 559, "text": "Yeah, and we have many answers right now."}, {"time": 561, "text": "In some ways the question of why we sleep was the wrong question too."}, {"time": 565, "text": "It's what are the plory potent many reasons we sleep?"}, {"time": 570, "text": "We don't just sleep for one reason because from an evolutionary perspective, it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine."}, {"time": 579, "text": "When you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not caring for your young, you're not foraging for food, and worse still, you're vulnerable to predation."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So on any one of those grounds, especially as a collective, sleep should have been strongly selected against in the course of evolution."}, {"time": 599, "text": "But in every species that we've studied carefully to date, sleep is present."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Yeah, so it is important."}, {"time": 607, "text": "So like you're right."}, {"time": 609, "text": "I think I've heard arguments from an evolutionary biology perspective that sleep is actually advantageous, maybe like some kind of predator prey relationships."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But you're saying, and it actually makes way more sense what you're saying is it should have been selected against."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Like why close your eyes?"}, {"time": 628, "text": "Because there was an energy conservation hypothesis for a while, which is that we need to essentially go into low battery mode, power down, because it's unsustainable."}, {"time": 638, "text": "But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water because sleep is an incredibly active process."}, {"time": 645, "text": "In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch but remaining conscious versus you lying on the couch and falling asleep, it's only a savings of about 140, 150 calories."}, {"time": 656, "text": "In other words, you just go out and club another baby seal or whatever it was, and you wouldn't worry."}, {"time": 662, "text": "So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation, much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time, much more to it than simply predator prey relationships."}, {"time": 673, "text": "If sleep really did, and looking back, even very old evolutionary organisms like earthworms, millions of years old, they have periods where they're active and periods where they're passively asleep."}, {"time": 686, "text": "It's called lethargicus."}, {"time": 715, "text": "And we've now realized Mother Nature didn't make a spectacular blender with sleep."}, {"time": 720, "text": "You've mentioned the idea of conscious states."}, {"time": 723, "text": "Do you think of sleep as a fundamentally different conscious state than awakeness?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "And how many conscious states are there so when you're into it, you're understanding of what the mind can do, do you think awake state, sleep state, or is there some kind of continuum?"}, {"time": 742, "text": "There's a complicated state transition diagram."}, {"time": 746, "text": "Like how do you think about this whole space?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "I think about it as a state space diagram."}, {"time": 752, "text": "And I think it's probably more of a continuum than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be."}, {"time": 757, "text": "So we used to think absent of anesthesia that there were already three main states of consciousness."}, {"time": 764, "text": "There was being awake, being in non rapid eye movement sleep or non dream sleep, and then being in rapid eye movement sleep or dream sleep."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And those were the three states within which your brain could percolate and be conscious."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Conscious during non REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say, but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I don't believe that though anymore."}, {"time": 791, "text": "And the reason is because we can have daydreams and we are in a very different wakeful state in those daydreams than we are when we are as we are now together present and extra septively focused rather than intra septively focused."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And then we also know that as you are sort of progressing into those different stages of sleep during non REM sleep, you can also still dream, depends on your definition of dreaming, but we seem to have some degree of dreaming in almost all stages of sleep."}, {"time": 828, "text": "We've also then found that when you are sleep deprived, there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep."}, {"time": 836, "text": "Despite the animal being, you know, behaviorally from best we can tell awake, individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells will go into a sleep like state."}, {"time": 847, "text": "And humans do this too."}, {"time": 849, "text": "When we are sleep deprived, we have what are called microsleeps where the eyelid will partially close and the brain essentially falls lapses into a state of sleep, but behaviorally you seem to be awake."}, {"time": 865, "text": "And the danger here is road traffic accidents."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So these are the, what we call these sort of microsleep events at the wheel."}, {"time": 874, "text": "Now, if you're traveling at 65 miles an hour in a two ton vehicle, you know, it takes probably around one second to drift from one lane to the next and it takes two seconds to go completely off the road."}, {"time": 888, "text": "So if you have one of these microsleeps at the wheel, you know, it could be the last microsleep that you ever have."}, {"time": 894, "text": "But I don't now see it as a set of, you know, very binary distinct, you know, step function state."}, {"time": 902, "text": "It's not a one or a zero."}, {"time": 904, "text": "I see it more of a, as a continuum."}, {"time": 907, "text": "So I've for five, six years at MIT really focused on this human side of driving question."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And one of the big concerns is the microsleeps, drowsiness, these kinds of ideas."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And one of the open questions was, is it possible through computer vision to detect or any kind of sensors?"}, {"time": 932, "text": "The nice thing about computer vision is you don't have to have direct contact to the person."}, {"time": 936, "text": "Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?"}, {"time": 941, "text": "Is it possible to detect these kinds of microsleeps or actually just sleep in general?"}, {"time": 947, "text": "Among other things, like distraction, these are all words that have so many meanings and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Just because you're looking at something doesn't mean you're loading in the information."}, {"time": 960, "text": "Just because you're looking away doesn't mean your peripheral vision can't pick up the important information."}, {"time": 965, "text": "There's so many complicated vision science things there."}, {"time": 968, "text": "So I wonder if you could say something to, they say the eyes are the windows to the soul."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Do you think the eyes can reveal something about sleepiness through computer vision, just looking at the video of the face?"}, {"time": 987, "text": "And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend, have talked about this."}, {"time": 991, "text": "I would love to work on this together."}, {"time": 993, "text": "It's a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But drowsiness is a tricky one."}, {"time": 997, "text": "So there's, what kind of information?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "There's blinking and there's eye movement."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And those are the ones that can be picked up with computer vision."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Do you think those are signals that could be used to say something about where we are in this continuum?"}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And I think there are a number of other features too."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "I think, you know, aperture of eye."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "So in other words, partial closures, full closures, duration of those closures, duration of those partial closures of the eyelid."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "I think there may be some information in the pupil as well, because as we're transitioning between those states, there are changes in what's called the automatic nervous system, or technically it's called the autonomic nervous system, part of which will control your pupillary size."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "So I actually think that there is probably a wealth of information."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "When you combine that probably with aspects of steering, angle steering maneuver."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "And if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well, my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature that creates a phenotype of, you are starting to fall asleep."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And as the autonomous controls develop, that it's time for them to kick in."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers sort of have something beta version, maybe an alpha version of this already starting to come online, where they have a little camera in the wheel that I think tries to look at some features."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Almost everybody doing this and it's very alpha."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "So, you know, the thing that you currently have, some people have that in their car, there's a coffee cup or something that comes up that you might be sleepy."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "The primary signal that they're comfortable using is the steering wheel reversals."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel and how much you're interacting with it as a sign of sleepiness."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "So if you have to constantly correct the car, that's a sign of like you starting to drift into microsleep."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "I think that's a very, very crude signal."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "It's probably a powerful one."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "There's a whole nother component to this, which is it seems like it's so driver and subject dependent."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways where you can't just use one signal."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It's kind of like what you're saying, there has to be a lot of different signals that you should then be able to combine."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "The hope is there's the searches for like universal signals that are pretty damn good for like 90% of people."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "But I don't think we need to take necessarily quite that approach."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "I think what we could do in some clever fashion is using the individual."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here is that there is an array of features that we know provide information that is sensitive to whether or not you're falling asleep at the wheel."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Some of those, let's say that there are 10 of them, for me, seven of them are the cardinal features."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "For you, however, you know, six of them and they're not all the same sort of overlapping are those for you."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "I think what we need is algorithms that can firstly understand when you are well slept."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So let's say that people have sleep trackers at night and then your car integrates that information and it understands when you are well slept."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And then you've got the data of the individual behavior unique to that individual, snowflake like, when they are well slept."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "This is the signature of well rested driving."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "Then you can look at deviations from that and pattern match it with the sleep history of that individual."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And then I don't need to find the sort of, you know, the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "I can create a very bespoke tailor like set of features, a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "You know, that would be my, if you want to ask me about moon shots and crazy ideas, that's where I go."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "But to start with, I think your approach is a great one."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Let's find something that covers 99% of the people because the worrying thing about microsleeps of course, unlike, you know, drugs or alcohol, which you know, certainly is a terrible thing to be behind the wheel."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "With those often you react too late."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "And that's the reason you get into an accident."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "When you fall asleep behind the wheel, you don't react at all."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "You know, at that point, there is a two ton missile driving down the street and no one's in control."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "That's why those accidents can often be more dangerous."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Yeah, and the fascinating thing is, in the case of semi autonomous vehicles, like Tesla autopilot, this is where I've had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk, and the human factors community, which is this community that one of the big things they study is human supervision over automation."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So you have like pilots, you know, supervising an airplane that's mostly flying autonomously."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "The question is, when we're actually doing the driving, how do microsleeps or general, how does drowsiness progress and how does it affect our driving?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "That question becomes more fascinating, more complicated when your task is not driving, but supervising the driving."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "And that is complicated, but the basic conclusions from many decades is that humans are really crappy at supervising because they get drowsy and lose vigilance much, much faster."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "The really surprising thing with Tesla autopilot, it was surprising to me, surprising to the human factors community, and in fact, they still argue with me about it, is it seems that humans in Teslas with autopilot and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant, at least with the studies we've done."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "So there's something about the urgency of driving."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "I can't, I'm not sure why, but there's something about the risk, I think the fact that you might die is still keeping people awake."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "The question is, as Tesla autopilot or similar systems get better and better and better, how does that affect increasing drowsiness?"}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And that's when you need to have, that's where the big disagreement was, you need to have driver sensing, meaning driver facing camera that tracks some kind of information about the face that can tell you drowsiness."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "So you can tell the car if you're drowsy so that the car can be like, you should be probably driving or pull to the side."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction of a human and machine, but currently it's mostly steering wheel based."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So this idea that your hands should be on the steering wheel, that's a sign that you're paying attention is an outdated and a very crude metric."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I agree, yeah."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I think there are far more sophisticated ways that we can solve that problem if we invest."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Can I ask you a big philosophical question before we get into fun details?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "On the topic of conscious states, how fundamental do you think is consciousness to the human mind?"}, {"time": 1473, "text": "I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So in your study of sleep, do you think the hard question of consciousness that it feels like something to be us, is that like a nice little feature, like a quirk of our mind, or is it somehow fundamental?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Because sleep feels like we take a step out of that consciousness a little bit."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So from all your study of sleep, do you think consciousness is like deeply part of who we are or is it just a nice trick?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "I think it's a deeply embedded feature that I can imagine has a whole panoply of biological benefits."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "But to your point about sleep, what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research and we've done some, it's very, very rare at all, in fact, for you to end up becoming someone other than who you are in your dreams."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Now you can have third person perspective dreams where you can see yourself in the dream as if you're sort of, you've risen above your physical being."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "But for the most part, it's very rare that we lose our sense of conscious self."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And maybe I'm sort of doing a sleight of hand because it's really what I'm saying, it's very rare that we lose our sense of who we are in dreams."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "We never do."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "Now that's not to suggest that dreams aren't utterly bizarre."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And I mean, when you slept last night, which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me, but when you went into dreaming, you became flagrantly psychotic."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And there are five essentially good reasons."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Firstly, you started to see things which were not there, so you were hallucinating."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Second, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true, so you were delusional."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "Third, you became confused about time and place and person, so you're suffering from what we would call disorientation."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions, something that psychiatrists will call being affectively labile."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience, so you're suffering from amnesia."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "If you were to experience any one of those five things while you're awake, you would probably be seeking psychological help."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "But so I place that as a backdrop against your astute question, because despite all of that psychosis, there is still a present self nested at the heart of it, meaning that I think it's very difficult for us to abandon our conscious sense of self."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And if it's that hard, the old adage in some ways, that you can't outrun your shadow."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "But here it's more of a philosophical question, which is about the conscious mind and what the state of consciousness actually means in a human being."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So I think that that to me, you become so dislocated from so many other rational ways of waking consciousness."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "But one thing that won't go away, that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know, manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?"}, {"time": 1678, "text": "Yeah, that's a strong sign that consciousness is fundamental to the human mind."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Or we're just creatures of habit who gotten used to having consciousness."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances or a lot of like mental work to escape that."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "I mean, it's like trying to launch a rocket."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "You know, the energy that has to be put in to create escape velocity from the gravitational pull of this thing called planet earth is immense."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Well, the same thing is true for us to abandon our sense of conscious self."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "The amount of biological, the amount of substances, the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "What does that tell us about then the fundamental state of our conscious self?"}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Yeah, it also probably says that it's quite useful to have consciousness for survival and for just operation in this world."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "And perhaps for intelligence."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "I'm one of the, on the AI side, people that think that intelligence requires consciousness."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "So like high levels of general intelligence requires consciousness."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Most people in the AI field think like consciousness and intelligence are fundamentally different."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "You could build a computer that's super intelligent."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "It doesn't have to be conscious."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "I think that if you define super intelligence by being good at chess, yes."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "But if you define super intelligence as being able to operate in this living world of humans and be able to perform all kinds of different tasks, consciousness, it seems to be somehow fundamental to richly integrate yourself into the human experience, into society."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "It feels like you have to be a conscious being."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "But then we don't even know what consciousness is and we certainly don't know how to engineer it in our machines."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "I love the fact that there are still questions that are so embryonic because, you know, I suspect it's the same with you."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "You know, it's questions where, you know, questions turn me on, answers less so."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And I love the fact that we are still embryonic in our sense of arguing about even what the definition of consciousness is."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "But I also find it fascinating."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "I think it's thoroughly delightful to absorb yourself in the thought."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Think about the brain and we can move back across the complexity of phylogeny from, you know, humans to mammals to sort of birds to reptiles, amphibians, fish."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "You can, bacteria, whatever you want."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "And you can go through this and say, okay, where is the hard line of, you know, what we would define as consciousness?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And I'm sure it's got something to do with the complexity of the neural system."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Of that, I'm fairly certain."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "But to me, it's always been fascinating."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "So what is it then?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "You know, is it that I just keep adding neurons to a Petri dish and I just keep adding them and adding them and adding them."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "At some point when I hit a critical mass of interconnected neurons, that is the mass of the, you know, the interconnected human brain, then bingo."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "All of a sudden it kicks into gear and we have consciousness."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "But there is something about the complexity of the nervous system that I think is fundamental to consciousness."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "And the reason I bring that up is because when we're trying to then think about creating it in an artificial way, does that inform us as to the complexity that we should be looking at in terms of development?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "I also think that it's a missed opportunity in the sort of digital space for us to try to recreate human consciousness."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "We've already got human consciousness."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "What if we were to think about creating some other form of, why do we have to think that the ultimate in the creation of, you know, an artificial intelligence is the replication, you know, of a human state of consciousness?"}, {"time": 1931, "text": "Can we not think outside of our own consciousness and believe that there is something even more incredible or more complimentary, more orthogonal?"}, {"time":

to create that magic, but it's a worthy effort."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "I also love, just exactly as you said, on the question of consciousness or engineering consciousness, the fun thing about this problem is it seems obvious to me that a hundred years from now, no matter what we do today, people, if we're still here, will laugh at how silly our notions were."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So like, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "And more than that, everything we'll do will be silly a hundred

of it and make sure that your opinion is not defined by the funding sources."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "And then the other is just your own success of, you know, for a couple of decades, publishing an idea and then realizing at some point that that idea was wrong all along."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And that's a tough thing for people to do, but that's also integrity is to walk away, is to say that you were wrong."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "That doesn't have to be in some big dramatic way."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way."}, {"time": 2352,

some ways to the issue of ego that you bond your correctness or your rightness, your scientific theory with your sense of ego."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "You know, I've never found it that difficult

this like group of people that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there and supporting each other."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "So it's fun to also watch how that's going to evolve in your case, because I wonder it'll be two a month."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "Or devolve is the answer to that."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "Well, I mean, some of it is persistence through the challenges that we've

sure if it's a biological chemical or it has to do with just the fact that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "All that to say, what do you think is the relationship between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?"}, {"time": 2852, "text": "If there's an interesting distinction there."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "There is a distinction."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So I think the first thing to say, which is going to sound strange coming from me is drink coffee."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "The health benefits associated with drinking coffee are really quite well established now."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "But I think that the counterpoint to that, well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "So, a lot of people have asked me about this rightful paradox between the fact that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Many of them Venn diagram overlapping with those that sleep provides."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "How on earth can you reconcile those two?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "It's called antioxidants, that it turns out that for most people in Western civilization because of diet, not being quite what it should be, the major source through which they obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "So the humble coffee bean has now been asked to carry the astronomical weight of serving up the large majority of people's antioxidant needs."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "And you can see this if, for example, you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee, it has a whole constellation of really great health benefits too."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So it's not the caffeine."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "And that's why I liked what you said, this sort of separation of church and state between coffee and caffeine."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself that provides those health benefits."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "But coming back to how it impacts sleep, it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "The first is that for most people, caffeine can make it obviously a little harder to fall asleep."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "But let's say that you are one of those individuals and I think you are, and you can say, look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner and I fall asleep just fine and I stay asleep soundly across the night."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "So there's no problem."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "The downside there is that even if that is true, the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And so you will actually lose somewhere between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep if you drink caffeine in the evening."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So to give you some context, to drop your deep sleep by let's say 20%, I'd probably have to age you by 15 years, or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "I think the fourth component that is perhaps less well understood about coffee is its timing, and that's why I was saying the timing and the dose make the poison."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "The dose, by the way, once you get past about three cups of coffee a day, the health benefits actually start to turn down in the opposite direction."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So there is a U shape function."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "It's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome, not too little, not too much, just the right amount."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "The second component is the timing though."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours, meaning that after five to six hours, 50% of that on average for the average adult is still in the system, which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating in your brain at midnight."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "So having a cup of coffee at noon, one could argue is the equivalent of tucking yourself into bed at midnight, and before you turn the light out, you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "But that doesn't still answer your question as to why are you so immune?"}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately very sensitive to caffeine."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning, I don't sleep as well that night."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "I love the routine."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "I love the ritual."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "I think I would love to be invested in it."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "It's just terrible for my sleep."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So I switched to decaf."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "There is a difference from one individual to the next, and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes called cytochrome P450 enzymes."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And there is a particular gene that if you have a different sort of version of this gene, it's called CYP1A2."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "That gene will determine the speed of the clearance of caffeine from your system."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Some people will have a version of that gene that is very effective and efficient at clearing that caffeine."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And so their half life could be as short as two hours rather than five to six hours."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Other people, hands up Matt Walker, have a version of that gene that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity could be somewhere between eight to nine hours."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "So we understand that there are individual differences, but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee and understand that it's not the caffeine, it's the coffee that's the benefit and the dose makes the poison."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "Is there some aspect to it that it's like a muscle in terms of all the combination of letters and numbers that you just said?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "Is there some aspect that if I can improve the quarter life, the half life, could decrease that number if I just practice?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Like I drink a lot of coffee, so like habit alters how your body's able to get rid of the caffeine."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine, but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And it's not at the level of the enzyme degrading the caffeine."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "It's at the level of the receptors that caffeine will act upon."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "But as you start to drink more and more coffee, the body tries to fight back and it happens with many different drugs by the way, and it's called tolerance."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to, these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths, as it were, that receive the drug, those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell and it's what we call receptor internalization."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So the cell starts to think, gee whiz, there's a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "So I'm just going to, when normally I would coat my cell with let's just say five of these receptors for argument's sake, things are going a little bit too ballistic right now."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors and downscale it to just having three of those."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect that one cup of coffee got you before."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee, all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself to expecting X amount of stimulation and now all of that stimulation is gone."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "So it's now got too few receptors and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse, things like heroin, when people go into abstinence, as they're sort of moving into their addiction, they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "So they need to take more of it to get the same high."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time, the system goes back to being more sensitive again."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell with these receptors."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon, if they go back to the same dose that they were using before 10 weeks ago or three months ago, that dose can kill them."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "They can have an overdose."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "Even though they were using the same amount at those two different times, the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug, it's the sensitivity of the system."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "In terms of training the muscle, as it were, the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Is there a time, the number of hours before bed, that's a safe bet to most people to recommend you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?"}, {"time": 3391, "text": "Like, is there an average half life that you should be aiming at?"},

is the average adult in society?"}, {"time": 3415, "text": "There is no such thing."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "But for the average adult, it would be probably cutting yourself off maybe 10 hours before."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "So assuming a normative bedtime in society, I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m. and just keep an eye out."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And if you're struggling with sleep, dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Can I ask you about sleep and learning?"}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So how does sleep affect learning?"}, {"time": 3445, "text": "Sleep before learning, sleep after learning, which are both fascinating kind of dynamics of the mind's interaction with this extra conscious state."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related to your memory systems and your informational systems."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "The first is you just mentioned is that sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of, you know, initially soak up new information."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "In other words, you need sleep before learning to effectively imprint information into the brain to lay down fresh memory traces."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain, and we know we've studied these memory circuits, will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged as it were for the sponge analogy, and you can't absorb the information as effectively."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "So you need sleep before learning, but you also need sleep unfortunately after learning too, to then take those freshly minted memories and effectively hit the save button on them, but it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "It takes hours because it's a physical biological change that happens at the level of brain cells."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "But sleep after learning will cement and solidify that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain, therefore making it less likely to be forgotten."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as, it's almost sort of future proofing information."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance to be remembered in the future rather than go through the sort of degradation that we think of as forgetting."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "So sleep after learning then sort of, you know, sets that information like amber in solidification."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "The third benefit, however, is that sleep, we've learned more recently is much more intelligent than we ever gave it credit for."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories and strengthen them."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross link and associate that information together."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "And it's almost like informational alchemy."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "So that you wake up the next morning with a revised mind wide web of associations."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And that's probably the reason that, you know, you've never been told to stay awake on a problem."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "And in every language that I've inquired about that phrase or something very similar seems to exist, which means to me that this creative associative benefit of sleep transcends cultural boundaries."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "It is a common experience across humanity."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "Now I should note that I think the French translation of that is much closer to you."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "I think you sleep with a problem."}, {"time": 3668,

3685, "text": "Sleep with the problem."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "That's why I love the French."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "So, and we can sort of double click on any one of these and go into detail, but the fourth, I became really enchanted by about eight years ago in our research, which was this idea of forgetting."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "And I started to think that forgetting may be the price that we pay for remembering."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit to letting go."}, {"time": 3725, "text": "And you may be thinking, that sounds ridiculous."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "I don't want to forget."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things, but the brain has a, well, we believe, has a finite

3745, "text": "It has constraints."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "If that's the case, we can't simply go through life being constantly informational aggregators unless we are programmed to say, we've got

"text": "I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "So for example, it's not beneficial from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember where I parked my car three years ago."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "So it's important that I can remember today's parking spot, but I don't want to have the junk kind of DNA from a memory perspective of where I parked my car two years ago."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "Now, I actually have in some ways a problem with forgetting, and again, I'm not trying to sort of be laudatory, but you know, I tend not to forget too many things."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And I don't think that that's a good thing."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "And there's a wonderful neurologist, Luria, who wrote a book called The Mind of the Mnemonicist."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "And it was a brilliant book, both because it was written exquisitely, but he was studying these sort of memory savants who basically could remember everything that he gave them."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "And he tried to find a chink in their armor."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "And the first half of the book is essentially about him seeing how far he can push them before they fail."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And he never found that place."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "He could never find a place where they stopped remembering."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "And then in his brilliance, he turned the question on its head."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "He said, not what is the benefit of constantly remembering, but instead, what is the detriment to never forgetting?"}, {"time": 3862, "text": "And when you start to realize his descriptions of those individuals, it's probably a life that you would not want."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "But it's fascinating both from a human perspective, but also AI perspective."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "There's a big challenge in the machine learning community of how to build systems that are able to remember for prolonged periods of time, lifelong continuous learning."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So where you build up information over time."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "So memory is one of the biggest open problems in AI and machine learning."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "But at the same time, the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting because you have to be exceptionally selective at which kind of stuff you remember."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "And that's where the step of assimilation, integration that you're referring to is really important."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "I mean, we forget most of the things."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting at the very edge of stuff that could be important or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?"}, {"time": 3924, "text": "Like for example, doing a podcast, I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting that's been problematic, which is I forget names and titles of books and so on."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So when I read, I remember ideas."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "I remember quotes, I remember statements and like that's the space in which I'm thinking."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "But when you communicate to others, you have to say this person in this book said that."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So it's the same thing with like Andrew Huberman is masterful at this."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "This is important academia, remembering the authors of a paper and the title of the paper as part of remembering the idea."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "And I've been

the feeling we shared, is the experience we shared."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "What I don't remember well is the detailed labels of those experiences."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And I need to

what I wanted."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "So you have to be able to use tricks of human communication for that."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "But so that, I mean, that's the, it's ultimately is a trick

that assimilation process."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff into this big web of the old stuff and the things that don't fit, you throw out."}, {"time": 4198,

one version of associative processing."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "And what I mean by that is we see the most obvious connections."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "So I think of wakefulness as a Google

the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier, so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time, don't go to bed any earlier, because then you're just probably your chronotype, your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep."}, {"time": 7346, "text": "And you think, well, it's a terrible night, I'm gonna get into bed at 9 p.m. rather than my standard 10, I'm just gonna be lying in bed

just fine."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "And we can play around with optimal durations depending on what you want."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "Just try not to nap too late into the day because napping late into the day is like snacking before your main meal."}, {"time": 7407, "text": "It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were."}, {"time": 7410, "text": "But that would be, so that's my unconventional second piece of advice regarding insomnia."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "The third is meditation."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "I found meditation to be incredibly powerful."}, {"time": 7421,

people using the meditation app in the evening."}, {"time": 7468, "text": "What they were doing was self medicating their insomnia."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "And they finally, rather than railing against it, they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "So I found meditation to be helpful."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "Having a wind down routine is the other thing that's critical for me."}, {"time": 7485, "text": "I can't just go from, because when my mind is switched on and I think you may be like this too, if I get into bed, that Rolodex of thoughts and information and excitement and anxiety and worry is just whirling away."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "And it's not gonna be a good night for me."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "So I have to find a wind down routine."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "Sleep is not like a light switch."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "You know, it takes time to descend down onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night."}, {"time": 7523, "text": "And we have this for kids."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "You know, I don't have children, but you know, a lot of parents will say, you know, we have to have the bedroom, sorry, the bedtime routine."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "You know, you bathe the kid, you put them in bed, you read them a story."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "You have to go through this routine, this wind down routine for them."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "And then they fall asleep wonderfully."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "Why do we abandon that?"}, {"time": 7546, "text": "As adults, we need that same wind down routine."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "So that's been the other thing that's been very helpful to me."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "So don't do anything different."}, {"time": 7557, "text": "If you have a bad night of sleep, keep doing the same thing."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "Then meditation, and then finally having some kind of disengagement wind down routine."}, {"time": 7571, "text": "Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "Is there, is it possible to have a healthy sleep life without the regularities?"}, {"time": 7590, "text": "I say that because I'm all over the place and I've gotten good at being all over the place."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "So I'll often, like what happens, I'll go stretches of time."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "There'll be sometimes a month where I, my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit, but they're like, just you and I here, just you and I."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "Like I'll just go all the way around comfortably and happily, I love it."}, {"time": 7620, "text": "And then there'll be a nap."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "I mean, if you like add up the hours when I'm just like sleeping as much as I want, it'd probably be like six hour average per 24 hours."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "Like that kind of, so it works out nicely, maybe even seven hours, I don't know."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "But that it's obviously irregular and there's chaos in the whole thing."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "Like sometimes it's shorter sleep, sometimes it's longer."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "Is that totally not

that a wake promoting chemical called orexin increased."}, {"time": 8352, "text": "And this is why a lot of people will say, when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer and I'm more alert, I'm more active."}, {"time": 8361, "text": "And I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective why we understand that to be the case."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "And then the fourth factor is that fasting didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "It did, however, decrease the amount of REM sleep or dream sleep."}, {"time": 8377, "text": "And we know that REM sleep dreaming is essential for emotional first aid, mental health, it's critical for memory, creativity."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "It's also critical for several hormone functions."}, {"time": 8387, "text": "It's when there's direct correlations between testosterone release peaks just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "So REM sleep is critical."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "But so those are the five changes that we've seen."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep."}, {"time": 8405, "text": "But the fourth point that I mentioned, which was orexin, which is this wake promoting chemical and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy where you're just unpredictable with your sleep."}, {"time": 8426, "text": "So orexin when it's in high concentrations keeps you awake when you lose it."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy where you're sleeping a lot of the time in unpredictable sleep."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "Why on earth when you are fasting would the brain release awake promoting chemical?"}, {"time": 8451, "text": "And our answer is right now is the following."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "One of the few times that I mentioned before that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep or prolonged sleep deprivation is under conditions of starvation."}, {"time": 8466, "text": "And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure."}, {"time": 8471, "text": "And at that point, the brain will forgo some."}, {"time": 8474, "text": "It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep."}, {"time": 8478, "text": "And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain, you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter, you need to stay awake for longer so you can travel outside of your perimeter for a further distance and maybe you will find food and save the organism."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "So in other words, when we fast, it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal that you are under conditions of starvation."}, {"time": 8506, "text": "So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness, I need to release the chemical that helps the organism stay awake for longer which is orexin."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "So that they can forage for more food."}, {"time": 8517, "text": "Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective doesn't know about this thing called Safeway that you could easily go to and break the fast."}, {"time": 8525, "text": "But that's how we understand fasting."}, {"time": 8528, "text": "And I think my dear friend, Peter Attia has done a lot of work in this area too."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "I think fasting and David Sinclair's brilliant work, goodness me, what an individual too."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "The work is pretty clear there that time restricted eating and fasting have wonderful health benefits."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "Fasting creates this thing called hormesis, just like exercise and low level stress and sauna, heat, shock."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "And hormesis is a biological process I think as David Sinclair has once said, in simple layman's terms is, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "And I think there is certainly good data that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits."}, {"time": 8577, "text": "It doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to enhance sleep."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "But it's interesting to understand its effects on sleep."}, {"time": 8584, "text": "I've fasted, it's a study of NF2."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "And I found that I got much less sleep and it was very restful though."}, {"time": 8602, "text": "I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt, which is I needed less sleep."}, {"time": 8606, "text": "I wonder if my brain is deceiving me because it feels like I'm getting a whole extra amount of focus for free."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "And I wonder if there's longterm impacts of that."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "Because if I fast 24 hours, get the same amount of calories, one meal a day, there's a little bit of discomfort."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "Like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder."}, {"time": 8630, "text": "Maybe there's just, I mean, hunger."}, {"time": 8634, "text": "But the amount of focus is crazy."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "And so I wonder, it's like, I'm a little suspicious of that."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "I feel like I'm getting something for free."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "I'm the same way with sweetener, like a Splendor or something."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "It's like, it's gotta be really bad for you, right?"}, {"time": 8650,

at least understand the biological basis of what you're describing."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "It's not that you actually don't need less sleep."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "It's that this chemical is present that forces you more awake."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "And so subjectively you feel as though I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "And those two things are quite different."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "It's not as though your sleep need has decreased."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch, the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake because food is in short supply."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "So you mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation, all those kinds of things for learning purposes, but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways in which we become psychotic in dreams."}, {"time": 8711, "text": "What do you think dreams are about?"}, {"time": 8716, "text": "Why do you think we dream?"}, {"time": 8717, "text": "What place do we go to when we dream?"}, {"time": 8721, "text": "And why are they useful?"}, {"time": 8722, "text": "Not just the assimilation aspect, but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?"}, {"time": 8733, "text": "Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?"}, {"time": 8738, "text": "So one of the camps in the sleep field is that dreams are meaningless, that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from as a physiological state."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb, that the reason that you create the apparatus of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light in the same way that we've evolved to this thing called REM sleep to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "But it turns out that when you create light in that way, you also produce something called heat."}, {"time": 8779, "text": "It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb, it's just what happens when you create light in that way."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "And the belief so too was that dreaming was essentially the heat of the light bulb."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "That REM sleep is critical, but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours, you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "I don't believe that for a second."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "And from a simple perspective is that I suspect that dreaming is more metabolically costly as a conscious experience than not dreaming."}, {"time": 8816, "text": "So you could still have REM sleep, but absent the conscious experience of dreaming was probably less metabolically costly."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit called ATP, which is the most valuable thing, there's usually a reason for it."}, {"time": 8835, "text": "So if it's more energetically demanding, then I suspect that there is a function to it."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "The first, as we mentioned, creativity."}, {"time": 8849, "text": "The second is that dreams provide a form of overnight therapy."},

during the day, sometimes traumatic, and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "And it sort of just takes the sharp edges off those difficult, painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you feel better about them."}, {"time": 8881, "text": "And so I think in that sense, dreaming, it's not time that heals all wounds."}, {"time": 8887, "text": "It's time during dream sleep that provides emotional convalescence."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "It's what you dream about that also matters."}, {"time": 8910, "text": "So for example, scientists have done studies with learning and memory where they have people learn a virtual maze."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "And what they discovered was that those people who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze were the only

sufficient to produce the benefit."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "You have to be dreaming about certain things itself."}, {"time": 8949, "text": "And the same is true for mental health."}, {"time": 8953,

difficult event itself, they go on to gain resolution to their clinical depression one year later."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "Whereas people who were dreaming just as much, but not dreaming about the trauma itself, did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution to their depression."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So it's, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal."}, {"time": 8990, "text": "And it's not just about the act of dreaming, it's about the content of the dreams, not just the fact of a dream itself."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "It's, first of all, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 9001, "text": "It makes a lot of sense, but then immediately takes my mind to, from an engineering perspective, how that could be useful in, for example, AI

artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "So one context in which this is applied is the process called self play, which is a reinforcement learning where agents play against itself or

up."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "So it is a state that seems to be very, I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep and tell me that it's not REM sleep, just say, look, based on the pattern of this brain activity, what would you say is going on in this person's mind?"}, {"time": 9494, "text": "I would say, well, they're probably not rational."}, {"time": 9496, "text": "They're probably not having logical thought because their prefrontal cortex is down."}, {"time": 9499, "text": "They're probably feeling very emotional because their amygdala is active, which is an emotional center of the brain."}, {"time": 9505, "text": "They're definitely going to be thinking visually because the back of the brain is lit up, the visual cortex."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "It's probably going to be filled with past experience and autobiographical memories because their memory centers are lighting up."}, {"time": 9519, "text": "And there's probably going to be movement because their motor cortex is very active."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "That to me sounds very much like a dream."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "And that's exactly what we see in brain scanners when we've put people inside of them."}, {"time": 9530, "text": "One of the things I notice sleep affects is my ability to see the beauty in the world."}, {"time": 9540, "text": "So what do you think is the connection between sleep and your emotional life, your ability to love other human beings and love life?"}, {"time": 9550, "text": "Yeah, I think it's very powerful and strong."}, {"time": 9556, "text": "So we've done a lot of work in the field of sleep and emotion and sleep and moods."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets, positive and negative."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "And what's interesting is that when you are sleep deprived and the more hours that you go into being awake and the fewer hours that you've had to sleep, your negative mood starts to increase."}, {"time": 9583, "text": "And we know which individual types of emotions are changing."}, {"time": 9588, "text": "I've got a wonderful postdoc in my lab called Etty Ben Simon, who's doing some incredible work on trying to understand the emotional, individual emotional tapestry of affective, meltdown when you're not getting sufficient sleep."}, {"time": 9607, "text": "But let's just keep with two dimensions, positive and negative."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "Most people would think, well, it's the negative that takes the biggest hit when I'm sleep deprived."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "By probably in a log order, magnitude larger is a hit on your positive emotions."}, {"time": 9623, "text": "In other words, you stop being sleep deprived of positive emotions, in other words, you stop gaining pleasure from normally pleasurable things."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "And it's a state that we call anhedonia."}, {"time": 9638, "text": "And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression."}, {"time": 9643, "text": "So depression to most people's surprise isn't necessarily that you're always feeling negative emotions."}, {"time": 9652, "text": "It's often more about the fact that you lose the pleasure in the good things in life."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "That's what we call anhedonia."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "That's what we see in sleep, an insufficient sleep."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "And it happens quite quickly."}, {"time": 9665, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of fascinating."}, {"time": 9666, "text": "I think I do, it's not depression, but like it's a stroll into that direction, which is when I'm sleep deprived, I stop being able to see the meaning in life."}, {"time": 9681, "text": "The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "Like it makes me realize how enjoyable everything is in my life because when I start to lose it, when I'm severely sleep deprived, you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "But that said, I'm just cognizant enough that sleep fixes all of that."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "So I use those states for what they're worth."}, {"time": 9704, "text": "In fact, I personally like to pay attention to the things that bother me in doing that time."}, {"time": 9712, "text": "Cause they also reveal important information to me."}, {"time": 9719, "text": "I have to use like a Rorschach to, yeah."}, {"time": 9722, "text": "I mean, there's, so I find this when I fast combine with sleep deprivation, I'm clear to see with people, clear and identifying the things that are not going right in my life or people that I'm working with are not doing as good of a job as they could be doing."}, {"time": 9741, "text": "Like people that are negative in my life, I'm more able to identify them."}, {"time": 9748, "text": "So I don't act on that."}, {"time": 9750, "text": "It's a very bad time to act on those decisions, but I'm like recording that information because I usually, when I'm well rested and happy, I see the beauty in everybody, which can get you into trouble."}, {"time": 9764, "text": "So you have to balance those two things."}, {"time": 9766, "text": "But yes, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 9767, "text": "But there's irony there too, which is the fact that, you know, when you're well rested and well slept, just as you said, you see the beauty in life and it sort of enlivens you and sort of gives you a quality of life that's emotionally very different."}, {"time": 9784, "text": "Yet then we are contrasting that against the need for not getting enough sleep because of the beautiful things that you want to accomplish in life."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "And I don't actually see them as, you know, sort of completely counterintuitive or paradoxical because I still think that you can strive for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for, to have the monumental goals, the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "They can still enthrall you and excite you and stimulate you."}]}]
