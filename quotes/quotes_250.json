{"time": 302, "text": "He's done a thousand for a double as well."}, {"time": 304, "text": "So then the next four years and I did a bunch of feats of strength on the way, but it was all about building that axial loading capacity, the strength that because now I'm moving the weight from my hands up to my shoulders."}, {"time": 316, "text": "And so to do it for reps is like so much harder than a single like five to 10 seconds versus 30 plus seconds to be able to buffer and manage all that with that kind of load is just crazy."}, {"time": 330, "text": "So it's literally about the duration that your body is carrying the load."}, {"time": 334, "text": "Yeah, that's a big part of it."}, {"time": 336, "text": "Yeah, because you have to you're using the resource of the diaphragm for stabilization."}, {"time": 341, "text": "And so it it's also responsible for respiration and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 345, "text": "So even when you're not squatting, you've got to be handling those loads."}, {"time": 348, "text": "Just holding that weight is fascinating."}, {"time": 350, "text": "It's like it's fascinating that the human body can do that, can can maintain that structure, just everything working together, that the biology, the skeletal structure, the the musculature on top of that can hold the weight."}, {"time": 365, "text": "It's fascinating to watch."}, {"time": 366, "text": "Everything is very intentful about positioning and how you're creating pressure and all this sort of stuff, especially for me."}, {"time": 372, "text": "So when I mentioned that half a dozen people have squatted it and half a dozen people have deadlifted it."}, {"time": 377, "text": "You understand those people all weigh three hundred and eighty to four hundred and forty pounds."}, {"time": 381, "text": "I weighed to sixty five to two eighty five, depending on where I was between the two."}, {"time": 386, "text": "So there's that as well."}, {"time": 388, "text": "So big, big difference."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And over the course of that, I did a lot of other feats of strength that fit in that capacity."}, {"time": 395, "text": "And we can skip over those."}, {"time": 397, "text": "But that was hugely invested as far as, you know, what I put into being able to accomplish that, because it's it's over the top, which means the other stuff had to shift and I had to learn."}, {"time": 409, "text": "There's so many things that came into place to pull that off."}, {"time": 412, "text": "And so, yeah, last March, two days before the world shut down, I did it."}, {"time": 416, "text": "It was supposed to be at the largest equipment exhibition in the world down in San Diego as an event."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And that got shut down a week beforehand, obviously."}, {"time": 425, "text": "So we moved to let's do it in my gym and invite people."}, {"time": 428, "text": "And that was on a Saturday and Thursday or Friday, they limited it to twenty five people for gatherings."}, {"time": 432, "text": "I did it on Saturday and then Monday, everything shut down."}, {"time": 437, "text": "So it was kind of surreal for timing wise."}, {"time": 441, "text": "And so if I hadn't done it, it would have never got done like because I I'd pushed to the limit."}, {"time": 446, "text": "I couldn't come back and do it."}, {"time": 447, "text": "It was at the total limitation of my capabilities."}, {"time": 450, "text": "So I'm pretty I'm pretty proud of it."}, {"time": 452, "text": "And the last piece was a every one of these feats along the way."}, {"time": 456, "text": "I collaborated with a charity that I believed in."}, {"time": 459, "text": "And there was a lot of those tied to my life story, which we probably will get into."}, {"time": 465, "text": "So it was threefold."}, {"time": 466, "text": "So that inspiration piece, inspiration, motivation, walking the walk and showing like just these methodologies that a guy that had to learn to walk again can do something like this with no back pain."}, {"time": 480, "text": "So if you if you there is a way."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And the third one is is to provide awareness and recognition around a lot of key charities."}, {"time": 489, "text": "So so your heart was in this journey, but also your mind is just you're like a scholar of strength, a scientist of strength, an engineer of strength for reps do a thousand pounds squat and deadlift."}, {"time": 503, "text": "Let's first talk through the actual day you did it."}, {"time": 507, "text": "What does it take to lift that much for reps?"}, {"time": 512, "text": "The day of is really easy."}, {"time": 517, "text": "The really the lift itself."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Other than a few seconds is really easy and not challenging."}, {"time": 524, "text": "People always ask me, what was it like?"}, {"time": 526, "text": "How beat up were you after that?"}, {"time": 527, "text": "And the deadlift."}, {"time": 528, "text": "And the simple fact is, it was easy."}, {"time": 531, "text": "The work to get there was horrendous."}, {"time": 535, "text": "So so even the psychology of the day you weren't there was not a fear."}, {"time": 540, "text": "There was not a nervousness."}, {"time": 541, "text": "There is not a doubt in your mind."}, {"time": 543, "text": "There were certainly doubts on that day from some training history."}, {"time": 547, "text": "So there was some major breaks to my confidence in the couple months leading up where I had issues with passing out under the bar."}, {"time": 557, "text": "So completely losing consciousness."}, {"time": 559, "text": "And this was on weight less than a thousand pounds even."}, {"time": 562, "text": "So that was like all this buildup in me going, what if what if I think I have this resolved?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "But what if I get up there and I can't even do a rep?"}, {"time": 574, "text": "How embarrassing will this be that I've been talking about this and planning for this for so long?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "But outside of that, I knew I could do it."}, {"time": 583, "text": "In fact, I wanted to do even more even up to the second rep. Training is about, you know, working into a fatigue state."}, {"time": 592, "text": "So you're building an amount of fatigue in your system."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And then when you let off of it, that's when you get a compensation."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And that's how you stairstep training."}, {"time": 602, "text": "This is periodization."}, {"time": 603, "text": "But leading into a big event, you're accumulating this massive amount of fatigue."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And so I was performing at a level that I could do it."}, {"time": 611, "text": "And so I knew I was going to be able to on me because then you then you give yourself that window to be able to recover and supercompensate and be able to do a little bit more."}, {"time": 621, "text": "So like that first rep when I did it strengthwise, I went, I could do this for five reps like it went through my head."}, {"time": 627, "text": "I'm like feeling I mean, it was easy and it was fast and it felt like amazing."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And I'm like, I'm going to crush this."}, {"time": 634, "text": "And then set rep to the realization kicked in as like, oh, this is for reps with a thousand pounds on your back."}, {"time": 641, "text": "And you're fatiguing just like and then the third one was every last thing I could muster to just finish."}, {"time": 648, "text": "I mean, I just barely got it done because it's the strength is like there."}, {"time": 653, "text": "But like that capacity to be able to manage all those resources for that amount of time because not just leg strength when we're talking about this stuff."}, {"time": 661, "text": "So what does it take to go from the from I don't know what like from five hundred to a thousand?"}, {"time": 669, "text": "That feels like a journey that's like exponential."}, {"time": 672, "text": "It's it gets exponentially harder."}, {"time": 676, "text": "In the early 2000s, like I said, I started lifting in 1988."}, {"time": 679, "text": "But my first meet in the early 2000s, my my max deadlift was five twenty three and my first squat was five hundred and fifty."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So that's the heck of a journey."}, {"time": 691, "text": "It is a journey for people that like to lift."}, {"time": 695, "text": "What should they understand about the difference between doing five hundred and a thousand in terms of the actual lift that you were experiencing that day in terms of the mechanics, in terms of all the things you have to be like the neurological adaptation?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "You mentioned the breathing, the core strength, like techniques, like little tricks, psychological tricks, anything that kind of stands out to you."}, {"time": 718, "text": "The level of intent and the opportunity for error are at a different level."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So just the minutest changes of position by quarter inch, half inch can be make or break at that level."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So these things, everything gets amplified."}, {"time": 765, "text": "You need to break it down and distill and practice to like it's one simple cue that we now lock down and control this torso stability because this is what these fundamental movements are about, is being able to control our spinal mechanics and then now be able to maintain that while articulating the joints around that through a range of motion and then using the main power drivers."}, {"time": 791, "text": "So in this instance, both instances, it's the, you know, the hip complex to generate that power and transfer it from how we're rooted and connected to the floor through to the distal end, you know, which would be the barbell on the shoulder."}, {"time": 805, "text": "You know, there's a couple key concepts."}, {"time": 808, "text": "So one is that what we just talked through is how to actually maintain that stability."}, {"time": 812, "text": "So if you have either the diaphragm, so which is connected at the rib cage."}, {"time": 817, "text": "So out of alignment in any position, it needs to be in alignment with the pelvic, the pelvis."}, {"time": 824, "text": "So those two in opposition."}, {"time": 825, "text": "So this is simple engineering here because what we're going to do is eccentrically load this."}, {"time": 831, "text": "We're going to use the diaphragm just like you would in a diaphragm pump where it's going to press down on all the tissue in there."}, {"time": 837, "text": "So we're not using breath."}, {"time": 838, "text": "So our breath was actually a lot of times a default pattern when people do that because they'll bring it into their chest and raise their rib cage."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So what we want to do is just initiate the diaphragm air can be used as well over the top at the final to create just a little bit more downward pressure."}, {"time": 855, "text": "But if we have out of alignment there, we have a pressure leak where it's going to be push out the front or the rear if you're either inflection or extension."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And then that causes this co contraction and all this pressure of the organs essentially against outward against all those tissue for the co contraction as well as surrounding the spine to be able to stabilize that."}, {"time": 879, "text": "And then it puts all the muscles on both sides of the body in what we call the best length tension relationship."}, {"time": 887, "text": "So if you think about a curl and we reach our arm out at the extended length, our bicep is not as strong and then all the way in the curl position, it's not in strong."}, {"time": 896, "text": "There's somewhere in here that's this control of both."}, {"time": 899, "text": "And so when you're sitting there arched or bent over, we have muscles that are past either one of those ranges."}, {"time": 906, "text": "So they've got a lot of tension, which then will create relaxation on the other side."}, {"time": 910, "text": "So we want to have an all of that needs to be working."}, {"time": 912, "text": "And now the next important thing is the foot."}, {"time": 916, "text": "So it's actually this connection to the ground and how we're actually using the foot and ankle complex to grab and grip this connection to the ground and elicit an effect."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And because of this and then the everything between will naturally kind of do what it needs to do."}, {"time": 935, "text": "So people like to focus on it, knee position or how far out their hips are or all this other stuff, which is outputs of this."}, {"time": 944, "text": "So if we control the torso and the knee, the only thing that can happen from that point is for the squat to happen."}, {"time": 954, "text": "So this allows us to use this massive, you know, the hip complex for all the muscles around that that are built to drive through hip extension to complete the squat."}, {"time": 964, "text": "I did actually miss one thing in there."}, {"time": 966, "text": "So this torso people often miss the lat is a spinal stabilizer as well."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So that's key in controlling function at the the T.L."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Junction, which is just above the lumbar spine."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So kind of right opposite where your sternum is and you'll see people kind of roll over sometimes like an Olympic squad or something like that, where they lose position."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And that's often because they're close grip because you can't engage the lats very well that way and they're pushing up in the bar."}, {"time": 991, "text": "But you want to be able to drive and pull the bar to your center."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And that's going to create and use the lats now to drive and connect the shoulder into this."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "We're kind of compressing and tightening all this stuff towards that center to create that entire torso stability."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So I was using torso stability, not just core stability in my conversation earlier."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "Torsus."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "OK, so there's all these like modules of the body then connected to the grounding with like your feet on the ground."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Everything you're speaking to."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "How do you work each of those modules?"}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Is this over time you kind of develop the feel that ultimately boils down to this one simple cue that you mentioned?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Or do you can you like literally study each particular module in yourself and see how it affects the lift?"}, {"time": 1040, "text": "So the best way and I believe it's because I hate just like people getting out and just doing just movement stuff and not actually adding load because we only adapt when there's load."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Maybe we can get some, you know, some proprioception or awareness of position and other stuff, doing some some corrective patterns and other stuff."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "But this is basic physiology is that there must be an imposed demand for us to have adaptation."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And this is mental."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "This is emotional."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "This is all these areas."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "But and people miss that."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So I prefer to be able to look at a person and this is our methodology and do the assessment in any basic loaded movement."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "So with developing an eye for that, you can actually see and go, OK, we've got a fault pattern right here in the foot and use a cue or a set of cues."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Doesn't really matter till we find the one that works and bring that."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And now we know we want to simplify this stuff."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "I just walk through."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "That sounds really complicated."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And it it is if we try to break down and distill it all."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "But like, let's just find the basic stuff that gets us in the range, start working and then find the next as we add load."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "Now we find where's our next area that we're starting to fault that and then go there again next."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So this is what we do, what we teach in our educational platform."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So we are the only I believe everybody wants to do a lot of these like assessments, you know, on a bench, on a table body."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And it's like, no, let's let's go squat."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "Let's go deadlift."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "If you do strongman and it's a yoke carry, let's yoke carry because these are basic human fundamentals."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "It's not powerlifting like this is how we function."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "This is why we we work with 29 of the 30 major league baseball teams and 90 percent of all professional sports out there in North America."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Sorry, although we do some work with Tour de France and other stuff as well."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And North America, I do mean hockey, too."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "But these principles like, you know, if if the Dodgers won't bring us in, they're not learning how to power lift."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "You know, we're going to obviously will probably be do we do a little bit more shoulder focus than hip focus with their athletes or their coaches."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "We're usually working with the coaches, not the athletes."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And so you help them."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And then the same thing on yourself to understand the role that these different muscle groups have."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "On the holistic."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So it's all about getting the joints in the appropriate position so that we can do that."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "We can manage load so that we're not putting undue stress on the joint."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "We're getting the proper link tension."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "We're getting these basic fundamental things with the body."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And so the the largest global impact that you will have is through spinal mechanics."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "I can't look at a shoulder if I'm not managing this because it's your spine."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So for those who are just listening, like I'm arching and then and then flexing, that's going to affect shoulder extension, flexion, all these sorts of things."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "So it could even affect things down of what's looking at dorsiflexion issues on the foot."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And then that's why I go to the foot next, because it has the second largest global impact."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And then from there, now I'm going to look at the big energy drivers, which is the hip complex, shoulder complex."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And then we can start looking at kind of the peripheral things."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "But usually that's some sort of output of the other."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "But the knees, the elbows, the things like that."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "So it's all about getting the stack, which affects neurology."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So let's talk in engineering terms."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "You get in a car, modern car today, and a lot of them will have this traction control button in there."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And there's a big misconception that, you know, I'm out and it's it's snowy or here in Austin, only rainy."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "Well, it probably doesn't rain much, but you're going around a corner, start slipping."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "It's like, oh, it's going to send the powers from the wheels that are slipping to the ones that are gripping and keep me from crashing and dying a fiery death."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Well, that's not how it works."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "It's the exact same."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "We've got we've got the we've got the tires, which are our foot, you know, the connection to the ground."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "We've got the power driver, which is, you know, the the engine, the transmission delivering, you know, the power through it."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And we've got the stability or suspension."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And then we have the neurology."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And what the neurology is doing, it's sensing that we don't have good stability or loss of connection somewhere."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And so I need to save you from crashing and hurting yourself."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "And so it goes to the engine and says, let's retard the timing."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Let's reduce the shift patterns."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And we're just reducing the power output."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "And that's straight how the human body works."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So when I do this stuff, it's actually affecting that."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "I mean, I can take somebody and do some minute changes with the neck position at the thoracic outlet."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "OK, and immediately see an enhancement in power output."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And I can measure it."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "We measure this stuff with velocity devices and see like a 10 percent jump."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And so think about that."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "What about all your training through the years where you actually had additional capacity?"}, {"time": 1325, "text": "But you weren't using it because your traction control was on."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "Now you figure this out stuff and now you start stacking it."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "Now you can see so much greater."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So it's not just injury prevention."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "This is performance and additive performance over time."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "This is huge."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And people don't really think about this stuff."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "But we can turn that stuff off, which is actually going to also, again, make us make us safer."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But what we want to do is the performance tuned race car."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "Do they have a traction control button?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "No, they got some amazing tires to grip the ground, a performance tuned suspension, and that driver is going to put what his foot to the metal."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "He's going to put it to the floor."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "OK, that's a performance vehicle."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "That's what we want to be."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "I want to continue on that line."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But first I have to ask, like, how did it feel to accomplish the grand goal?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "OK, when you just stand back."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "Oh, my thousand pounds for reps.

differences in the different disciplines of strength?"}, {"time": 3557, "text": "So power lifting, we talked about maybe just to clarify for people, power lifting, Olympic lifting, just regular gym fitness, bodybuilding, doing curls in front of the mirror for hours like I do."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "What's, what's the difference between all of these?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Oh, and also strong man."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "Every one of those, as far as the athletic disciplines are different qualities."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "So we want to think about things as terms of quality."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "So there's strength, there's power, there's endurance, there's the ability to be coordinated and athletic."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "There's all these things and they're different, they're different qualities."}, {"time": 3598, "text": "So your training as it relates to that is how you cycle in the development of those qualities."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "So it's just going to be a little different based on what the output is and what the desired."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "So like powerlifting is actually, power is the wrong word."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "There's actually no power in it."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "It's just brute, it's, it's strength, um, application of force, um, Olympic lifting would actually be a better name for powerlifting because that is more explosive development."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "There's um, strongman is again, now we're getting a little bit more athletic."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "It's equipment based on the implements and stuff that are used, how fast you can move your feet and run mixed with more endurance, but still very strength focused."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And there's some things with strongman that is straight."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Like each one of these is very also focused on different genetic dispositions."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "So actually if you look at the history of sports, you'll find that they're a lot of times based on different populations and it sounds like it's very unPC, but like a Highland games, um, they've got deep, deeper hip sockets that are shallow."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "So you're going to see a lot of short hip hinge movements like the, the caber toss and things like that."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "Muay Thai wrestling, they've got a completely different hip joint."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "And so strongman itself is going to be for very large frame individuals."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "If you're not well over six foot and a large person, you're probably not going to perform well."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "It's sub six foot have ever done well at strongman just because it's, it's leverage based, right?"}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Um, Olympic lifting, we see consistently in, in Europe, uh, the, the history tells us a high level of hip, uh, and back issues because of the depth that that hip socket has to go in to be able to complete that lift."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "And so you're going to see issues with populations that don't have the ability to do that."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "So, so we've talked a little bit about training as well as disposition."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "So, and also cross head fits into that, that's more like strongman, but for a wider variety of bodies, I suppose."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "And definitely more metabolic conditioning focus than the, than the strength aspect of it."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "Um, and, and, and conditioning is an interesting thing too."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "So that quality in my opinion can be developed a lot faster, but kind of peaks much faster as well."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "Um, where strength, we can continue to add and add and add over time."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Uh, so it's for me, like for conditioning with any strength athlete, I don't like to spend as much time on that."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "So I'll cycle, uh, the conditioning work for our strength athletes and then taper that off leading into meat."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "So the more metabolic work, that means the more capacity in strength training that you can accomplish, which is the goal, um, and recover from."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "But then as we lead to a competition, we want to spend more time on recovering from that."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "So we have to pull things out."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "So we'd pull out less."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "So like a typical approach would be like taking a six week cycle for conditioning and ramping, ramping up over three weeks periods time, then dropping back down again and ramping up and being slightly offset by like a week or two from your strength peaks so that you've actually tapered the week prior in your conditioning work to your strength work."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "So we're not hitting conditioning hard all the time, which is a common, common, uh, misstep that people make is going, well, I need conditioning."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "So they just hammer that at a base level over the top instead of cycling that."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "If we talk about powerlifting in terms of regimen, in terms of exercise, in terms of the process, the wood consistent with what, is there something to be said about general qualities of the consistency of the regimen required to get strong?"}, {"time": 3851, "text": "So let's talk about some training principles as a whole."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "And this will, I think this will break down what you're, what you're one, the more work that we can fit into a given time, the more progress we're going to make."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "But that doesn't mean doing the max amount of work possible at any given time."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "So we know that we're always to, to, to accomplish more, we're always going to have more."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "And there's a certain ceiling that you're going to hit that you're not going to be able to add more."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So you want to start and get the most amount of results that you can with the least amount of work, because you're going to have to do it again, like this stair step over and over year, decade, so on."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "So when people is a big miss, people got, they look at a Chico program from Russia or so on and they go, I'm going to follow this."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "It's like that was specifically written for somebody with 20 years of experience that's already built the capacities to be at that level."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "So it's all about building that work capacity."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "So how much work can you give in a given time?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "So now we want to look at some research is it relates to injuries because injuries are going to be a big driver over time of what holds you back."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "So when we talk consistency, training hard for three years, five years, it's going to be really good."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "But what we find is a lot of people train really hard for nine months, have to slow back for a month, get back into it and miss another week because, and so on."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "They're always like this little nagging, that little nagging."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And so it's pretty clear in the research we want to, we're looking at when we're stair stepping this stuff, we're looking at acute and chronic loading."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "So some fancy words for average and like what's happening right now."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "So this given week would be our acute, chronic would be what is our average loading let's say over the last six months."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So the more that we can move the chronic loading up, the more work we're getting done on as a whole over time, we're going to get stronger."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "The way that we build the capacity to do that is having spikes in acute loading."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Now as we do this, the, the acute loading, if it spikes more than 10, maybe 15% from what the chronic loading has been, that accounts for 80% of injuries out there."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "So it's not actually the movement quality or this misstep or the other may usually happens about four or five, six weeks later, it's like, Oh, this nagging and then it gets worse."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "And then now you got to, you got to do some rehab, your training sessions aren't as good and so on."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "So now we're starting to look at this."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "It's like, I want to do the, I want to do the least amount of work where I can still progress."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "I want to be able to have spikes in my weekly demand that don't go above 10 to 15% of what I've been averaging for the last month."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "But every time I do a spike, my, my average goes up, right?"}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Boom, boom, boom."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And then that becomes very particular also when you take, when you do take plantain time off."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "So a lot of people, uh, training session, maybe they're doing a five week block with a, uh, a deload week or you go on vacation for a week or any of those things that were a downward."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "What does that do to your average and chronic loading?"}, {"time": 4054, "text": "It brings it down."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "And then what does the person want to do when they come back, make up for it."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "Now they have a huge spike above five weeks later, we're dealing with all this elbow, this wrist, whatever's kind of bothering me and now you're not performing as much."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "So these are some really fundamental pieces of, of, of, of training."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "And then now we can start overlaying the qualities that we're trying to develop that we were talking about earlier."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So now it's, let's talk about my deadlift, my thousand pound deadlift."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "We'll talk about the training cycles for both the thousand deadlift and squat."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "So backing up a year out from the deadlift, knowing I was training at the time, heavy deadlifts once a week and usually it was two of those sessions a month were really heavy and the others weren't."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "And it's like, okay, how can we get this up to where I'm deadlifting twice a week?"}, {"time": 4103, "text": "Because that's where I want to be, uh, to be able to accomplish this."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "I need to be loading about that much with frequency, with a certain volume to be able to accomplish this goal."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "We're not going to go through all the math and stuff like that and how that's arrived, but there is math behind this."}, {"time": 4117, "text": "And so instead of just like, oh, well, let's start deadlifting twice a week."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "So we start and we take the one session that we've got and we split it, part of it, take part of it away and put it in the second half of the week."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So the total volume is still the same."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "And then, um, we start adding some volume, but I'm doing it at a off a block so that the actual load is accumulative load is less cause I have less range of motion."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "And then we start building that closer to the ground, closer to the ground and so on."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And now we start getting to where I'm almost doing two sessions, full sessions a week."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "And then we start adding a little bit of load."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "And so at my level, this isn't talking about adding another set or another day a week."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "We're talking like in my squat, it might be one rep instead of doing three sets of three at one week, I do two doubles or two triples, then two doubles to give me one more rep. That's it."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "And so we're doing that from one week to the next."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "And that's a cycle training cycle."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "It might be five, six weeks and then so on and the next one and slowly bringing that average load up."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "So the last phases of the squat, for example, we took the average loading every week."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "So my, of my heavy sets."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Once we developed all this stuff over the last year to get to this point, now it is taking and going, okay, my average load this week is eight reps at nine hundred and fifty five pounds."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "And then the next week, let's get it to nine, nine fifty seven, nine sixty three."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "And this was pretty aggressive working up to where my average loading the final that the final was nine hundred and eighty five pounds average load for eight to nine reps. And that's what I said."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "This is the intense part."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "This is the day of was much easier that week over week is pretty brutal."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "May not sound well, you're just squatting."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "And now let's back up."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Let's look at the quality development."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "So a year out from the squat, obviously, I've been working on developing axial load capacity, my capacity to withstand load from top to bottom."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "So I like thinking about things and movement vectors."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "So this vector is an axial loaded vector is the hardest to recover from that was axial."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "Like is deadlift, are they both or both?"}, {"time": 4256, "text": "So a horizontal front to back would be like a row or a press."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "Why is the axial hardest to recover because it's entire body, the entire entire body, just anything that is that taxes the the spinal mechanics?"}, {"time": 4271, "text": "I don't I could tell you my beliefs."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "It's studied."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "OK, we can just keep the discussion on that short like that."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "Well, so we start looking at those different vectors that we're training in."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "And so this is why this is important to understand."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So I'm not just getting into nuance here."}, {"time": 4289, "text": "So, hey, squatting is going to make me make me jump further because it's legs."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "Well, squatting is an axial load vector and jumping is a vector this way."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "So actually, hip thrust would help with your and this is proven in science with your forward jumping ability."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "They're both working similar muscles."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "The glute extension, but they're working it in those different platforms."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "So it's really important to understand because people don't understand."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "I'm building my work capacity by doing sled process."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "You're not developing your work capacity for squatting."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "Most movements, even ones as holistic as a as a squat, require specialization."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "You can't get strong at the squat by doing it."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "You're going to have some carry over, right, obviously."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "But because taking an untrained person that hasn't done it is still not going to do as good as somebody that's done nonspecific work, but done work."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So but yes, for the most part, to get truly strong, you need to specialize."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "So but not all the time."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So now we talk about quality."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "So and if we specialize in the same thing too long, we stagnate because the body adapts to a certain point and just can't make progress."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "So we wanted to save the actual squatting in the pattern with the bar that I was doing for the very end."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "So starting a year out, I started doing work front squatting like a squat axial loaded pattern and worked on maximizing that up."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Then I started shifting to doing transformer bar squat."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "It's this bar I developed that actually change manipulates spinal mechanics."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "So I started loading in these more forward positions and being able again."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "So now I'm getting closer than a front squat, but not quite squatting."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "And then I would start adjusting that bar every training cycle to closer to a squat toaster to a squat till it finally was right."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "What's the difference between a front squat and a regular like a back squat?"}, {"time": 4405, "text": "Like in terms of the stress on the body, the mechanics, was there something interesting to be said about like how fundamentally different are they?"}, {"time": 4415, "text": "People think about the weight and imposition to them like, oh, the bars in front of me, the bars behind me, which is not the case."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "The bar is above your midfoot."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "The load is above your midfoot."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "So we're actually manipulating the spine behind the bar."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So we're causing spinal uprighting behind the bar, getting in a more erect position, which is going to change the relationship of the hip angle."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "It's going to change our ability to maintain the spine."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "It's going to change how much the core comes in, how hard it is to maintain that sternum to diaphragm relationship that we talked about."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "All this stuff starts changing."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "So the bar stays in the same place."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "Bar is still behind you, but the load moves around."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "But we're actually manipulating the spine around the load."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "We can tailor it to an athlete, which is great when you got a seven foot plus tall baseball player or basketball player."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "That's why we work with all these teams."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "Anyway, so it's like you're taking something and getting closer and closer to it."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "At the same time, we're looking at the quality."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "So like I needed to be able to really hold this torso position with the weight moving up here."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Unlike the deadlift, the ability to manage this TL position becomes much more challenging."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "So that was also why I was choosing the transformer bar, because it actually challenges that more in those big forward positions."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "I was also working on my back strength tremendously to be able to hold the maintain position."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "So there was a lot of like I chose a bent over rows."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "So bent over row is a mixed vector."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "So it's a forward to back."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "So it wouldn't have as much carrier, but it's also got some axial loading component in it as well."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "So we're working on that."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "And then as we get closer and closer to competition, I'm developing those strengths."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "But now I need to start tapering those out."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "So all of my recovery needs can now go into the more specific that I'm actually ramping the load up."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So as I'm ramping the load on the weight, I'm able to ramp it a lot faster because I'm tapering out the other stuff."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "So I can still keep my total load high, but now get it very, very specific."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "So everything that I've done has always been kind of an annual training cycle."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "And then again, this was like this was a five year training cycle, but we just kind of walked through the last year of each and you can see how these concepts play out in reality."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "So in the cycling."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So this is both for you, but also for more recreational strength athletes."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "Let's say there's variety injected into this."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "You need variety."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "So you will basically stagnate at some level, right?"}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So you should always be kind of shifting a little bit."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "So three to four month blocks in general for an average, you know, just a gen pop fitness is pretty good where you're going to spend more time maybe in a higher rep range or lower rep range, a little bit more work on endurance capacity or maybe some more time."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "Hey, I'm playing around with boxing or jujitsu or something like that."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "Bring that a little bit more to the front for a while and bring the other out."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "But like mixing mixing those variables up, but trying to keep the total load the same and always kind of like, you know, do we add a little more?"}, {"time": 4601, "text": "Again, it doesn't have to be major and it shouldn't be major."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "You don't want these big jumps."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "You don't go, oh, my God, let's move."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "Let's jump into squatting every day."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "You've got to build the capacity to do that."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "What role would you say strength has in sports that combine skill and strength?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "So for me personally, maybe I'll just ask it selfishly, which is grappling, wrestling, MMA."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "How about I start with baseball?"}, {"time": 4637, "text": "The sport."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "OK. No."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "Baseball and golf are two of my favorite sports."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "You don't have to be in shape at all to excel at those sports."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "Well, here's the thing."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "I'm going to get this argument."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "Well, I've got a perfect example, because this is why I sell so many Transformer bars into the Major League Baseball."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "So they get these people that come in, these athletes, that have been baseball their whole life."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "It is part of the culture."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "And so they're great athletes."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "They've got all this skill."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "The only thing they have to do is develop a little bit more resilience so that they don't have the injury."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "They can push their training a little bit more, that they can add a little bit more force output and be able to recover from it."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "So the only thing they've got to do is add some training."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "But there's no training culture there, so they don't have any experience, which is why they love the Transformer bar, because they don't have to worry about teaching the technique."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "We can actually set the bar on a setting that makes their squats perfect by cueing all the stuff with actually not having to coach it."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "Because when you're coaching a roomful of athletes, it's really hard to teach the nuance of all this and not sure that all that."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "But that's all that they have to do with these players with a huge level of skill."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "So once you reach a certain level of skill, adding strength is the only real forward path."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "So that's the basic, simple answer to that."}, {"time": 4719, "text": "So one of the benefits there being injury prevention, actually."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "Injury prevention."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "Resilience."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "Because especially fighting sports, you're going to be challenged and thrown and other things happen to you."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "And the more resilient you can make your structures, the better you're going to be."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "Even a cyclist, mountain biking."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Why would they need it?"}, {"time": 4738, "text": "Why would they need to do upper body training?"}, {"time": 4739, "text": "Take a crash, your shoulder's gone."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "Your career's over."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "Unless you've done a little training."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "So there's value in all this stuff."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "But the resilience, that's huge."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "And then we can overlay strength."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "Where we miss is this focus on strength when we haven't developed quality motor patterns first."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So this is a huge thing with children."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "Because people want to know what's the appropriate training age."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "I'd have had my daughter training before my son."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Because she developed movement patterns that have better quality earlier."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "There's no age."}, {"time": 4774, "text": "Because it's going to be very dependent on the individual."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "There's no point in having adaptation if we don't have the right thing to adapt to yet."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "And that applies to general movement, but also to sport."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "You're saying the skills should be developed first and then the strength applied on top of that."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Maybe you can educate me, but I actually quit lifting and powerlifting for a long time after I started Judo, Jiu Jitsu, grappling, all this sort of combat sports."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "Because I found that it was preventing me from relaxing my body enough to load in the skill."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "So this isn't a problem with the training."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "This is a problem with you."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "So this is actually really, really important."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "The first product I ever released was a loadable mace, a swinging mace."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "And because every power lifter and body, well, not every, but most serious power lifters and bodybuilders, like shoulders, mobility is pretty limited."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "And most of them really, really struggle with this."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "The problem is they've been taught to have tension all the time."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "So when we talk about the joint positions that we were talking about earlier and having those and the muscles in the right length and tension relationship, athleticism is the speed to relaxation because the counter is speed to contraction."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "And so what a mace can do is use that because this ties back into a developmental kinesiology because a lot of like reset patterns are getting back into these basic movements, but it's as much about relaxation as it is contraction."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "So a mace, we have this weight on a big long lever."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So if I grab a kettlebell and this would be like the same movement as a kettlebell halo, it is the same movement as a, but here in the halo, I'm on the whole time with the mace at the proper length, with the right distribution, you cannot do the movement."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "You could not move force your way through it."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "The only way that you can accomplish that is by relaxing."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "And then now we, now we can contract all the muscles related around that shoulder girdle all at once."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "We're working on, off, on, off, on, off with moving and contracting."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "And now, so what happens a lot of times as we, you know, this stiffness and tightness happens."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "So in four positions, we start using stabilizer muscles to do the movement."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "And then that's where this stiffness come from."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So it means that in some of whatever training that you're doing, there's a deficit in the movement quality, okay."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Or there's a deficit in the training program and you're not recovering from an 80% of the time."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "That's the right answer."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "But yeah, that's where the, where the gap is and learning how to relax and the way a lot of the exercises are taught and have been taught for a long time, which is why there's a big gap."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "And this is why both clinical rehab and all these other components are mixed in my philosophy and what I'm trying to do with Kabuki strength, because I'm looking at holistic movement."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "I'm not looking at powerlifting based movements are what I want to load and be able to assess on."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "But this affects all sports, all activities and strength doesn't have to be that."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "I mean, I'm freaking a thousand pound squatter and deadlifter."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "If you watch any of my videos where I do like complete quad fallbacks, I don't stretch at all."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "I can usually get close to a full split."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "Like if I want to."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "No, I did not see those videos."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "That's, that's hard to believe."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "Well actually I do."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "I just did one recently, a quad fallback with my, with my mace loaded way out to the end torsioning on both ends of the other."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And like I do a lot of, I do a lot of weird stuff."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "But squatting doesn't make your hips tight."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "Squatting like shit makes your hips tight."}, {"time": 5022, "text": "And so, but there is no perfect world where always our training program isn't quite perfect."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "Our movement isn't necessarily perfect."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "Like so you're going to have the needs for this stuff."}, {"time": 5032, "text": "But if you're always have to do some soft tissue work to loosen up the same one for that exercise, to be able to get a joint in position, there is a problem."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And I'm not saying don't do it, do it because I don't want you to have a joint."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "Like if I can't get my shoulders in a position, I can't do overhead presses because I'm going to compromise my spine position."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "Then I'm going to end up with some other problems."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "So go ahead and clean that up so you can get in position, but go figure out why it is and fix it."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And then maybe next, you know, three, four months from now, they're going to get a little something else going on, fix it, but go understand the deeper root reason of why."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So I'm, I believe I am the only company manufacturing and selling, you know, fascial soft tissue tools."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "And I'll tell you, I don't want you to use them."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "Cause it's not helping you get to the why, why it was caused in the first place."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "The goal, the goal, the perfect state is not having to use them."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "Reality is you're going to have to use them from time to time because the world's not perfect."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "So your discovery is a hundred percent on point."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Well there's another side to combat sports when you're beginning a particular combat sport, strength can be a negative because human psychology, because you can get away with a lot when you're strong."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "Yes, you can."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So if your mind is strong enough to where you can just turn off that advantage and be a beginner, truly in a particular art, that's probably the best way to do it."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "But you can get away and then you don't learn."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "Uh, it's hard not to use the little advantages you have because like jujitsu is a big hit on an, on the ego for, you know, especially guys, you know, when like a smaller person just destroys you, dominates you when you can, uh, I don't know, deadlift whatever number of pounds."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "And uh, it's hard not to use that strength to then resist the slow, the ultimate destruction by like 120 pound, but that, and that's why I recommend developing the skill quality first, but it doesn't, it doesn't mean that you can't, I can't, you can still do it so that don't take it as a like, oh, I can't go that direction."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "But understand those things and then also understand the jujitsu is additional load on the body."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "So you have to, you can't just add it on top."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "You've got to taper back the other, you're going to have to make a, I'm sorry, you may not want to hear it, but you're not going to be able to do as much and add that here."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "It's a compromise because your total volume still has to be there and there's not, unfortunately, not really a way to measure what the jujitsu volume is with this."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "So you've got to take a look at that and that's where like measuring like heart rate variability or other stuff can be useful so you

6169, "text": "We change the torque on the on the joint that we're working, which is the same."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "That's actually what is creating the force."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "So if I'm doing a front raise, it's where this this downward force is times the distance away."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "Which also then makes it no force when I've got at the bottom of the front raise,

it's offset just that a kettlebell, you can't do it because the offset so far it becomes a wrist movement."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "So ours has three different sizes and the offset just enough so that you can pick."}, {"time": 6202, "text": "If I put it in a front raise position or curl position, I could put it in outward position and the force is almost what it is at the at the top."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "Then I get the top and it's the same exact or the curl."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "So I can actually change the force curve in the movement and then I can just release the pressure a little bit and let it swing into position and keep doing a drop set with never letting it down."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "So it's got a really nice texture grip that allows you to hold it in different positions."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "And then the load offset is just enough that it doesn't overpower the wrist."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "And then you've got different hand sizes so that you can maximize this relationship and hit whatever joint that you're applying."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "So sounds incredible."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "It's really freaking well, it's awesome because you can because the variable load."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "Now I could go straight from front raises to side raises or rear or curl because without like because I don't have to put it down."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "So now my time under tension goes through the roof."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "And by the way, the same effect with a flywheel trainer because the variable whatever you put into it is what it kicks back."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So you have a constant time under tension because there's no rest points either."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "So all this stuff is

adjust the carbohydrate intake based on the needs."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "I'm not anti carbohydrate by any means, um, cause a lot of people will, they look at me now when they see like how lean I

weight with those, with those diets, um, you know, protein actually has a thermogenic effect."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And so you have to have a massive amount of fats if you have a only meat diet

"text": "Um, but that isn't actually a performance."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "So those types of keto and carnivore are not performance diets."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "So they're not going to be as

athlete with a, with a vegan diet, but it's not as easy to do it with other diets."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "So on you're missing some base nutrients, so many nutrients and meat, I believe, uh, having greens in your diet is really beneficial."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Lots of research, but there's people in the other worlds that argue that they don't need them, but they help clear organs,

a ton of weight to eating less and dropping all the way down to, you know, seven, 8% body fat with veins standing out everywhere without a tissue on me, just with amazing, great tasting food to lose weight or be healthy does not mean that you need to eat flavorless bland food."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "So that's the main thing I try to get across."}, {"time": 7012, "text": "Eat less to lose

it works, any of those things."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "So diet approach, when you look at diets, understand that they're how aggressive they are."}, {"time": 7034, "text": "So like keto can make you lose a lot of weight."}, {"time": 7036, "text": "Carnivore can make you lose a lot of weight."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "A lot of that upfront is actually dropping glycogen stores."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "So you're actually just reducing water in your muscle and fat tissue."}, {"time": 7045, "text": "So which is why it doesn't, isn't as great for a performance diet."}, {"time": 7049,

need to find a lifestyle because that's what sustainable, I hate the word diet to begin with."}, {"time": 7066, "text": "But behaviors are sustainable and then do that and then over time the things

lifestyle, whatever, what was the level of happiness?"}, {"time": 7100, "text": "So not like weight loss or weight gain or all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7105, "text": "It's the entirety of the picture, productivity, just feeling good throughout the day, socially also, like interacting with people."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "Because so much of a human connection, like I mentioned before,

bodybuilding, like the eight meal a day diet has never worked for me because I've always been a very bit like trying to fit that between meetings and other stuff."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "What that diet provides is it just you get less bloat in distention of a larger meal."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "But at the end of the day, you get the same exact results."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "Pick a lifestyle, live that you can have really great tasting food."}, {"time": 7166, "text": "And that to me is the same thing."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "And this is why I'm like really hitting this point, because also with the dieting and like the approach like, oh, I'm going to do this and people pick these chicken and broccoli recipes and guess what?"}, {"time": 7179, "text": "You're going to break."}, {"time": 7180, "text": "If you do not, if you do not enjoy it, you will break."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "So it is a very important point."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "Well, I also slightly push back or maybe to elaborate, if you don't enjoy moderation, for me particularly, I have trouble moderating certain things, most foods, I would say."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "So my source of happiness comes with foods, even if they're bland, the ones that can enjoy, but enjoy moderation."}, {"time": 7213, "text": "So there's, I mean, I enjoy every piece of food."}, {"time": 7216, "text":

"text": "So let me ask about a complicated topic that's sometimes a bit controversial, which is steroids and maybe TRT, testosterone replacement therapy."}, {"time": 7242, "text": "What role does that play in strength training?"}, {"time": 7245, "text": "We're going to go there."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "But it's an important discussion to have."}, {"time": 7252, "text": "I think that it's something that I can be more transparent on."}, {"time": 7258, "text": "In my past, I wasn't able to do to the career that I had."}, {"time": 7261, "text": "So just like covering that stuff in a, you know, one of the, on a public forum when you're highly looked at being an executive for recruiting and other stuff, like it was an area I had to just kind of pass on, right?"}, {"time": 7278, "text": "Now I've used steroids."}, {"time": 7281, "text": "I've used them since I was 33 and I basically just use TRT now after my big squat."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "So for 10 years I used them and there's some interesting components to this."}, {"time": 7298, "text": "So one is just the gray area of what we call performance enhancing supplements."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "So performance was a PEDs that the line of what defines a PED is ever shifting and it's shifting based on society norms, cultural norms, government body agencies, all these sorts of stuff."}, {"time": 7321, "text": "So I'm not making excuses here."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "So I just want to elaborate before I actually start digging into the details here because performance enhancing, I could take sodium bicarbonate and enhance my ability to perform deadlifts for reps."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "I did that for my Guinness world record for deadlifts in a minute."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "People do it for rowing

"text": "They're not able to make it illegal because everybody eats bread, well, not everyone."}, {"time": 7360, "text": "And so it's a little hard to test for no matter what you do at any level."},

getting is no matter what you do at some point, by someone's standards, you are cheating."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "And because it is, you're taking something that, but you could work around these things with nutritional ways or other ways versus taking a chemical strip and there's whole lots of ways to do this, but it's like, oh no, it's steroids, it's not, it's injectable, it's not."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "So somewhere there's a culture or a person that will say you're cheating no matter what."}, {"time": 7437, "text": "So it's a self defined, you need to define it for yourself

or no."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "When there's an event like the Olympics, maybe then you have a standard that you're all trying to adhere to and then it makes sense to keep a certain, like to be within, there's an ethical imperative."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "So yeah, I'm not talking about that, I'm agreeing to compete in this by these rules."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "Yeah, but when you're trying to maximize your own performance, whatever that journey is, whatever that goal is, that's a different story and it's not easy to figure that out."}, {"time": 7497, "text": "You're just like

7610, "text": "So we can literally look at the statistical data and actually find out what do steroids do."}, {"time": 7616, "text": "And so it's pretty clear that steroids provide about a 10% increase in strength on average over not."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "Now that does take out the fact that steroids will put you in, allow you to put on more mass so you'll go up a weight class a lot of times."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "So as a whole, you could definitely lift more probably than the 10% over time, right?"}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And then we think about steroids as the ability to just put on muscle."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "And here's where things get a little interesting, even with people that use steroids is not understanding the neurological impacts that steroids have."},

standpoint to make you stronger."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "But we have a tapped in neurologically to to elicit those games."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "And there's a whole lot that happens neurologically."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "Like how much science is there in terms of all the different ways you could take steroids, which kinds of steroids, the timing, the dose, the all of those things to develop the neurological, the physical, the skeletal, like all the, you know, you've talked with such depth about the science of strength building in terms of form, in terms of the equipment that you use."}, {"time": 7697, "text": "It seems like a component, you know, the use of steroids should be an equal level of scientific rigor when applying them."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "Now, the research is harder to get because of what it is."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "But there is a lot of research that was done when they were legal."}, {"time": 7716, "text": "So they were legal up in through the through, I think, the mid 80s."}, {"time": 7720, "text": "And so a lot of the classical high, high benefit to low risk steroids were studied."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "And then since then, there's a lot of like designer steroids or new steroids that have come up that don't have a lot of research around safety and risk and things of that nature."}, {"time": 7739, "text": "And we can't do that because it's, you know, because of the legality around these things."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "But some of the stuff on the neurological function is really just understanding how that chemical structure works and what it's doing to the neurotransmitters, what it's doing."}, {"time": 7757, "text": "And so some of it is is really talking to people that have experience with it."}, {"time": 7763, "text": "And the other is understanding those structures and what they do."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "The neurological component, I think, is more interesting than than most, because the most steroids act through increasing muscle protein synthesis."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "That's how you add more muscle is they have an anti catabolic effect and they have a muscle protein synthesis enhancing effect."}, {"time": 7785, "text": "So it reduces the amount of muscle that you waste and increases the amount of muscle that you put on."}, {"time": 7791, "text": "But the neurological component is is tremendously valuable for what it can do for your training workout."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "Like if I handle more load over time, I'm going to make more progress."},
