"text": "It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us, to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices and successes across an entire history of economic transactions."}, {"time": 370, "text": "We can boil that all down to the price."}, {"time": 372, "text": "So it's data compression."}, {"time": 374, "text": "And if you can change, if there's a central body or central governance mechanism that can manipulate that money, it can have an impact on your mind."}, {"time": 385, "text": "For instance, today, so I agree with you on the first hand, say that I do believe in free will."}, {"time": 392, "text": "I do believe in individual autonomy, but I also think that there are certain devices and powers in the world around us that can actually influence how we think."}, {"time": 402, "text": "And it's fascinating to think about the fact that money might be actually deeply integrated into the way we think and into our mind."}, {"time": 411, "text": "You think about what are the core aspects of the human mind?"}, {"time": 414, "text": "What influences cognition, the way you reason about the world?"}, {"time": 418, "text": "You have the Chomsky languages at the core of everything, but you're kind of placing money as pretty close to the core of what it means to be an intelligent reasoning human."}, {"time": 431, "text": "I think money is a direct derivation of action and speech, actually."}, {"time": 436, "text": "It's another expression of the logos."}, {"time": 439, "text": "If we even think of what it means to think is that we are generating two different courses of action, potential courses of action, and we're populating them with avatars, right?"}, {"time": 451, "text": "Maybe ourselves or others."}, {"time": 452, "text": "And then we're comparing how we may act in each situation and what we think the result would be."}, {"time": 457, "text": "So actually it's comparison."}, {"time": 460, "text": "Basically it's comparison and contrasting of possible courses of action."}, {"time": 464, "text": "And that's the same thing with words themselves."}, {"time": 468, "text": "Most words, the vast majority of words only have meaning in relationship to other words, right?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Now people have argued with me about this because there is a first word, right?"}, {"time": 482, "text": "Where you pick up rock and say rock."}, {"time": 484, "text": "But most other words in higher abstraction tend to be relative."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And what's funny about action and speech, and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here, is that it's linked to evolutionary biology and that once human beings adopted upright stance, we freed our hands."}, {"time": 507, "text": "We no longer needed our hands for locomotion."}, {"time": 510, "text": "So we started to evolve more dexterity and notably we have opposable thumbs."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So this gives us an ability to manipulate and particularize the environment in a way that most other animals cannot."}, {"time": 522, "text": "And what's interesting about this is that as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources and count, point, pointing was a big deal and that we could indicate prey or items that are far off distance and we could organize ourselves."}, {"time": 540, "text": "At the same time we co evolved this fine musculature in the face and tongue."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So it's as if speech developed, co evolved really with our dexterity."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And as a natural extension of that came us making tools."}, {"time": 557, "text": "Right, we started to create things to better satisfy our wants over time."}, {"time": 561, "text": "And the most tradable tool in any society or the most tradable thing is money."}, {"time": 566, "text": "So I really, I argue that action and speech are quintessential modes of self sovereign expression."}, {"time": 575, "text": "And the money is just sort of a tech layer we've put right on top of that."}, {"time": 578, "text": "And that it's a natural derivation of action and speech."}, {"time": 582, "text": "Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty from the evolutionary perspective."}, {"time": 587, "text": "And then ultimately money is the technology layer that enables sovereignty."}, {"time": 592, "text": "So, you know, it's really fascinating to think about our modern human society as deeply rooted in these like evolutionary roots from the very origins of life on earth."}, {"time": 605, "text": "So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned, what do you see are some interesting characteristics of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?"}, {"time": 618, "text": "Like what ideas propagated through, have roots in the evolution?"}, {"time": 623, "text": "Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life is the territorial imperative."}, {"time": 629, "text": "So all life is seeking to expand its dominion over space and time."}, {"time": 637, "text": "And we think about, you know, again, physically with space, it's advantageous to an animal or an organism to have more territory under its control to raise offspring."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So it's all about reproductive fitness at the end of the day."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And then we'd also think of reproduction itself as the genetic impulse to have more, to replicate oneself across time."}, {"time": 658, "text": "So it's territoriality across time in a way."}, {"time": 662, "text": "And this is very common in most animals."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Not all animals are territorial, but many are."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And you see very interesting behaviors resulting from territoriality."}, {"time": 671, "text": "This is like animal combat."}, {"time": 673, "text": "You know, the reason birds sing is territoriality, a number of other things."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And it's my hypothesis and others have shared this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly, I think, would argue a territorial species and that he expresses this territoriality in property rights."}, {"time": 695, "text": "So property, when we hear that word, we typically think of an asset."}, {"time": 699, "text": "We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever."}, {"time": 702, "text": "But property is actually the socially acknowledged relationship between a human and an asset, such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities to a particular asset."}, {"time": 713, "text": "It is not the asset itself."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So property, it's information, it's a relationship."}, {"time": 719, "text": "By the way, my mind was just blown."}, {"time": 721, "text": "Property is information, it's not the actual asset."}, {"time": 727, "text": "Yeah, and then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves such that property, that the contributions people are making are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So if you're adding value to a piece of property, you're developing a piece of land for use, in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights to that fruit if you go out and plant a garden or whatever it may be."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And this is rooted in natural law, where we have rights to life, liberty, and property."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Those are kind of just the base, the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly."}, {"time": 769, "text": "And you could think of, to get really primordial with it, the first capitalist in the world, just to kind of get some definitions out here, I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism as the spectrum I'll speak on."}, {"time": 786, "text": "The first capitalist in the world would be the guy, the caveman, that maybe dug a little hole for himself to shield himself from the elements."}, {"time": 794, "text": "Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself."}, {"time": 800, "text": "I thought you were gonna go, because you said primordial, I thought you were gonna go back to like earlier biological systems."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I guess primordial for human, perhaps."}, {"time": 809, "text": "For humans, yeah."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And then the first communist or socialist would be someone that decided the fruits of his labor belonged to him."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So he would have violently encroached on that individual and taken his plot for himself, for his own use."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And that's the spectrum across which capitalism, in the pure sense, and communism in the pure sense operate in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights to the fruits of their labor."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So anything they spend their time, effort, energy creating in the world, they own the rights to that and they can trade those rights with others, other self owned people that have done similar things."}, {"time": 850, "text": "Communism or socialism would imply that other people, typically the state, have the rights, at least some rights to the value you've created."}, {"time": 859, "text": "So there's this interesting moment when that first caveman, that first capitalist drew a line, a circle in this cave and said, you know, this is mine."}, {"time": 869, "text": "You could say it was free to be claimed at the time he claimed it."}, {"time": 874, "text": "But it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset."}, {"time": 881, "text": "When space time, as you were referring to it, becomes something that's now can be possessed by a human being."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Is there something special about this moment?"}, {"time": 891, "text": "Because it feels like, first of all, in terms of space and time, it feels like there's a lot of available space time yet to be claimed."}, {"time": 902, "text": "So if we just look at like the universe, right?"}, {"time": 905, "text": "We're talking about, there's a funny thing with Elon Musk and Mars, I think they sneaked in there for SpaceX, that nobody on earth has any authority on Mars or any, this is a very interesting question."}, {"time": 918, "text": "It seems almost like humorous at this time, but perhaps not, perhaps there'll be sections of space, not just on planets that are gonna be even fought over."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So is there something special about this moment?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "Because in discussing sort of violence and respect for property, it feels like this is a special moment because ultimately conflict arises when you make claims on a particular territory."}, {"time": 946, "text": "It's not always in conflict where people say, when you look at Hitler or something, for example, his claim would be in many of the lands that he attacked and invaded that this is ultimately, this has always belonged to Germany."}, {"time": 962, "text": "So is there something you could say as to like what it means to own an asset or a property?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers, we could say that property was mostly a loyal title, which meant it's just whatever you can defend, right?"}, {"time": 982, "text": "So if you've got knives and daggers and satchels and maybe some pelts you've hunted, whatever you can hold and defend is yours."}, {"time": 992, "text": "And there's not like, there's a government to appeal to, you're just sort of a free agent operating in the wild, defending the assets you can protect on you more or less."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And what really changed the nature of property is when we get into the agricultural age."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So there's a big flip where we went from just foraging and hunting all the time, constantly moving, trying to stay alive to deciding we're gonna settle here."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "We figured out how to cultivate crops."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "We can create, we can increase the population because we can harvest more energy from the sun and we can establish a longer term civilization."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "What happens in that transition is that we begin creating economic surplus."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "So for the first time in history, we have stock houses of grain to defend or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is we're creating, we now have savings."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And it's at that time when government emerges as well, because once you have savings or you have an economic surplus, you have something that other people want to steal, right?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "This one thing we'll touch on a lot today is people always want something for nothing."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "People are always seeking the path to get something for nothing."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And I think that drives a lot of our decision making."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And it actually encourages us to be innovative in a lot of ways, right?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "We're trying to, you could say it's our laziness that's helping us be inventive in a way."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "We're trying to accomplish greater results with less efforts over time, but we can cross that line in seeking something for nothing where we start to violate the life, liberty, and property of others."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And that's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society to something more communistic."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And so that's what government is."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "It's a protection producing enterprise for the economic surplus generated by a trading society."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So when people begin to trade, they create what's called the division of labor, which is a very common economic term, basically means you're better at making hats, I'm better at making boots."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots, and we trade, we've created a positive sum game where you and I both benefit."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts through trade."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "And that's why human beings do trade because we become more energy efficient as a result."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "We create more outputs per unit of input."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And you can think of government in that respect, if we're looking at it maybe in a tech sense that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth, generates innovation, generates all, this whole lap of luxury we live in today that we've inherited from our forebears is from the market."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's not from a government."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "The government is the network security, if you will."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "So we're paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace, to preserve life, liberty, and property in that network so that we can have, you know, when there's inevitably disputes over private property, we can have nonviolent dispute resolution in the rule of law."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "And we can have a reasonable expectation of being able to conduct commerce without violence."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "The problem has been that the protector tends to, you know, they're in a monopolistic position, we would say."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "They tend to start abusing that position to obtain property for themselves."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Again, trying to get that something for nothing."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "When you control, you know, you are the security guard for the economy."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "The first thing they tend to monopolize is money because if you can control the money, you're effectively controlling people, their energy, their perceptions."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And that becomes a, you know, particularly through inflation, becomes an avenue to get something for nothing and that you can just print more money that everyone else is forced to sacrifice their time and energy to obtain."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What are your thoughts about anarchism?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "So I talk quite a bit, he'll be here in a few days, actually, Michael Malice, about ideas of anarchy."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "And his idea or the idea of anarchists is that any amount of government will eventually become the very kind of thing that you're referring to."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "So there's almost no way to have a government that doesn't then try to monopolize power, money, and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Do you think it's possible to have a government sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy, maybe libertarianism, I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes, but where you have a small government that protects the liberty and property rights and those kinds of things and doesn't expand to then also control the monetary system and all those other things?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Agreed completely, it was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So for the first time in history, we have a money that cannot be monopolized, cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed, cannot be weaponized, frankly."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Our current monetary system is weaponized by those who can print money against those who cannot."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And I think when you have, at the heart of every modern economy, which even we could say the US, we pride ourselves as free market capitalists."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "You know, we out competed communism in the 20th century."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "We think that this is the superior model."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Most business people will tell you that the free market is the best allocator of resources, all of these things."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "But what we have at the heart of every modern economy, including the US, is an anti capitalistic institution, which is the central bank."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "The temptation to monopolize money throughout all of history has been too strong for anyone to resist."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So any, even benevolent, quote unquote, dictators that have taken over, many dictators have inherited, say, an inflationary regime where society is coming apart because someone was clipping the coins or someone was printing too much money, and they'll commit to going back to a hard money standard."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance, such that they cannot violate the money to benefit themselves."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "But inevitably, over time, because it is a political institution, there's an incentive there, right?"}, {"time": 1370, "text": "For, again, to get something for nothing, to spend more than you're making through tax revenues."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And with that incentive, people typically, ultimately end up pursuing that inflationary path."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So we can get deeper into that about, inflation is a term that we've been conditioned to think today is just something normal."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "The prices just go up, and then it's pertinent to a healthy economy, but it's actually, if you look at it from real first principles, it is just theft integrated into the money."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "It's a technology backdoor, is another way to think about it."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "You wouldn't buy a cell phone knowing that someone could siphon your data off your private calls and sell it into the market."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff today, and that's something else we can get into, but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?"}, {"time": 1417, "text": "You prefer that your cell phone and your data was monetized by you, or if you're gonna sell it, you would be able to selectively sell it."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Inflation is that it's similar, it's a tech backdoor."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So it's a money that only a few people can siphon value off of surreptitiously, typically slowly, but eventually, as we've seen throughout history, that slowly builds up into a rapidly and then causes the monetary system to collapse."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "Do you think there's a benefit to inflation, possibly?"}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So when you have perfect information, perhaps you don't need inflation, perhaps it is purely theft, but I think of inflation as like the snooze button on the alarm."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So if you have a hard standard, you better wake up when the alarm rings, but all of us kind of like probably shouldn't, but use the snooze button."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "It's like, okay, well, five more minutes or 10 more minutes, and then you're saying there's naturally a slippery slope where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with and you abuse, but nevertheless, the usefulness of the snooze button is that you don't know how you'll be actually feeling when the alarm rings."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "You might be able to ready to pop up."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "It might be like you really need those few more minutes to psychologically get yourself out of bed."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "This metaphor is just not working at all, but do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes from like an economics perspective?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt in that inflation does provide an immediately stimulative effect when used early on."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "But what it's doing is it's, again, we talk about the balance between incentives and disincentives, right?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "That being necessary for a system to function properly."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "With inflation, you're essentially giving the people that can print money a way to dampen the disincentives they face."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "And another way to look at this is when you, so using inflation, using quantitative easing, you can decrease short term volatility in the marketplace."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So the market is basically this idea, this form of free exchange that's trying to zero in on the best ideas."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality, to satisfying the most wants."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "It's gonna overshoot, it's gonna undershoot, you have these little business cycles."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "But when it's undershooting and you're experiencing a business recession, in a capitalist environment, the market needs to clear that malinvestment, that misallocation of capital."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "That means someone made a bet on a certain idea that it would satisfy wants in a particular way, and that bet did not pan out."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "If you then paper over the losses that business is creating, you're now delaying and exacerbating the volatility that that idea created."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So this is kind of a Tel Aviv concept where you can dampen short run volatility, but volatility is truth."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality, right?"}, {"time": 1613, "text": "We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "So you delay volatility, you're just amplifying it and exacerbating it in the long run."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And that's what central bank is doing."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "The central bank mandate is low unemployment and low and expected inflation, basically."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And so they're trying to achieve economic growth in a stable way, quote unquote, stable way."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "This is their ostensible purpose."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And that's just not possible."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "Growth is an inherently instable process."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Can you elaborate a little bit about the nature of volatility?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Why is it communicating truth?"}, {"time": 1657, "text": "That's something that a lot of people are afraid of is the volatility."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Almost like it's a sign of chaos, and so they want to escape chaos."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "But you're saying that that's actually, whether it's chaos or not, I don't know, but it's getting us closer to the fundamental reality that we should not be trying to escape."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Yeah, so if we consider that the universe is pervaded by entropy, right?"}, {"time": 1686, "text": "This is the second law of thermodynamics is that every closed system tends towards greater disorder over time."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And that life itself, again, I would argue expressed through the logos, we, life, is the antientropic principle."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order, chaos into order."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right?"}, {"time": 1709, "text": "We're living at the edges of the known, and we're testing ourself against the entropy of nature, trying to figure out new and better ways of saying, doing, or making things."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And then if we do crack a code or figure something out, we then have a big incentive."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "The incentive is to get rich, right?"}, {"time": 1727, "text": "Because then you have a new idea that you could then sell back into the marketplace."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "So it's this sequence of courageously confronting the entropy of nature and converting it into good and useful order, which by the way is like the ancient idea of God in Genesis, which I think is interesting, that actually enables us to construct civilization in these layers of anti entropy or order, you might say."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "So today we live in a bubble of anti entropy or order, like the coastlines are guarded by the nation and the city has a certain police force that keeps it in order."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Even the way we talk, like clearly the words matter, but also the nonverbal cues, all these things are like order that has been established over many, many, many thousands of years of human evolution."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "And I think that's, when I say volatility is truth, what I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty is something that's ineradicable from life, right?"}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And certainty, like it's kind of a paradox because we're fighting against it, right?"}, {"time": 1798, "text": "We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty to create more capital, which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "So this is why you might have like a stash of food in case the power goes out or a generator, like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "So there's gotta be this balance with one foot in, one foot out."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So human society is this kind of bubble of order that we've constructed and slowly expanding, but at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos, that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs are kind of like jumping into that chaos and some of them die and some of them succeed."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order, you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And reverence for entrepreneurship because these are the people putting their neck out, so to speak, risking themselves."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And they're gonna contribute to society, by the way, whether they go up in flames or not."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "If they go up in flames, society has witnessed their experience as something not to do or something that doesn't work in a particular time and place."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So that you could say them going up in flames is a way of enlightening the rest of us."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "Or if they figure something out, Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "So enlightening the rest

something new, if you're a pioneer of any kind, you are courageously facing pain."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "You're willfully confronting it."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "So I don't think it's avoidable

reducing the overall risk of existence by accumulating more capital in the world."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "And that's what protects that entrepreneur that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "I'm gonna go try this business idea."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "I'm gonna put all my money on the line."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "And if he goes up in flames, then

"And it gives you actually more potential to go out and experiment, to go out and confront the chaos of nature because you are better healed effectively."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "So I think we're speaking in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitals and when it works well."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "Is there any aspects that you think that don't work well in a free market in all the basic pragmatic truths that we were talking about?"}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Is there ways it can go wrong?"}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So I would first argue that we have never seen an actual purely free market."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "Closest example would be kind of geopolitically we have a free market and that governments are not necessarily governed but they are premised on governing large groups of individuals."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "So that's not, doesn't exactly."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "You mean between governments?"}, {"time": 4433, "text": "See, but isn't there still, so a free market, maybe you can correct me, is the free market still grounded in the ideas of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?"}, {"time": 4443, "text": "So governments tend to also sometimes be violent towards each other."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "So maybe another way to look at this is that gold is the original governor of government actually."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "And this is the reason governments have abused and gone off of the gold standard."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state and you produce more currency than your gold reserves can justify, then gold will flow out of your bank or out of your country."}, {"time": 4485,

not decreed by government."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "It provided this natural check on government action."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "So my, I guess to get back to the original question is we've never seen a pure free market because money has always been monopolized and coerced, frankly."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market is really difficult because we've never actually seen it."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "And I would define free market is one in which government only protects life, liberty and property."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And so that has a very minimal role in society."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "Again, just as network security for the economic trade network."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "And anything that, any government function that goes beyond those three core functions, which by the way, are pretty much the core tenants of morality as well."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "So government's just really intended to preserve, you know, natural law, if you will."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "Anything that goes beyond that is, moves us closer to an unfree market."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "So every regulation, every act of coercion is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market, which would be a monopoly."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "So in terms of what I guess theoretically we could say goes wrong in the free market is that it's volatile."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "It's trading off, it's accepting short term volatility in exchange for less long run volatility."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "So if we look at something like there's a region in North America called Baja, California, and it runs into the United States and it runs down into Mexico as well."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires."}, {"time": 4615, "text":

off."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "North America, when wildfires spring up, we're actually extinguishing them."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "So we're constantly trying to dampen the short run volatility of these small brush fires."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "We let nature do its thing."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "The consequence of this is that the wildfires still occur eventually, but they're much larger and much more devastating in North America where human intervention has occurred because it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "So again, we're delaying short term volatility and exacerbating long run volatility."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "And in Mexico, it's the opposite, right?"}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Just these wildfires burn much smaller and more continuously over time."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "The further effect of that in North America is that the fires can get so big and so hot that it burns away the top soil."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "So the point of this is that human intervention, right?"}, {"time": 4682, "text": "Even the intention behind North American authorities managing that forest fire is to create less destruction."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "That is the intention, but the intention is divergent from the outcome."}, {"time": 4695, "text": "So in Taliban speak, he would say that human intervention moves us from mediocre stan into extremist stan."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "So mediocre stan would be something much more like nature where for instance, you can't double your body weight in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?"}, {"time": 4713, "text": "But in extremist stan, which is something much more information based, you can double or send your net worth to zero in a single trade in a single moment, right?"}, {"time": 4724, "text": "So when we try and intervene with natural biological systems that have these feedback loops, we actually start to push the system more to behave more like an extremist stan system that has less short run volatility, but more extreme long run volatility."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "So, but the question is, where you look at capitalism or communism, for example, and by the way, yes, I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist, like Richard Wolff is a pretty eloquent defender of these ideas because it's always good to really understand ideas as opposed to just reject them offhand."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "When you look at the system of capitalism or the system

another definition of money, by the way, a social device for moving value across space and time."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold, we introduced, first

money."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And that if you centralize the custody, the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt called a warehouse receipt for that gold."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "And

space."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "Paper currency gave us the ability to move value across space, but it introduced this attack vector for warehouse operators, which became banks, which became central

amount of humans, a geographic dispersed such that portability had certain properties that you want to achieve for humans in the geographical space to be able to be a exchange value."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "It became more of an issue as we globalized, right?"}, {"time": 6380, "text": "As we became more of a global society, we needed money that could move across space really fast."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "So we could trade in international capital markets."}, {"time": 6389, "text": "So that drove the central bank to become the dominant institution of the world."}, {"time": 6395, "text":

War II in Color."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "Oh yeah, that's really good."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "When I say gold has been the governor of governments or gold is geopolitical money, like it is the base layer operating system, has been the base layer operating system for analog society."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "So it's always been about who controls the gold, is who makes the rules."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "And that's, in that context, is why Bitcoin is so interesting because it is the disruptor to this base level operating system that's functioned for all of human history."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "I think this is a good place to ask, we asked the what is money question."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "What is Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 6449, "text": "That's a question as complicated as what is money?"}, {"time": 6455, "text": "I think if you get a general understanding of money from a number of angles, that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior monetary technology that has ever existed."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "So one of the most superior implementation of the ideas of money that you talked about, you talked about money as speech, you talked about money as an idea, we talked about money as sovereignty."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "So we're attaching the concept of money, to your point, to whatever tool best satisfies those properties of money or best renders those services we need for money."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "And as you said, you're using the word tool and technology interchangeably here."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "And another thing to think about here is that we think often in terms of goods or services, but actually everything is a service."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "So it's not the physical properties of this pen that I find valuable, it's the services that it renders to me, that I want to write a letter, this serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper and communicate information."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "So value, humans attach value as we alluded to earlier, two services, not goods."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "So the properties or the services that money renders that human beings value are those five properties, divisibility, durability, recognizability, portability, scarcity."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "Metals best satisfied those services historically, but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology in human history, essentially perfects them."}, {"time": 6556, "text": "It's as close to perfection as we've ever been."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "So in terms of divisibility, each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits called a satoshi."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "If that divisibility were ever a problem, which actually there was a question that came up recently, if you divide the world

activity?"}, {"time": 6590, "text": "And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork into further divisibility."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world and the average Bitcoin or wealth will say 300,000 satoshis each, but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee and do all these day to day transactions, what would happen?"}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Well, we would increase its divisibility."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility, the divisibility of money, lets us transact across scales, right?"}, {"time": 6616, "text": "We can buy coffee or we can buy a house."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "Durability is an interesting one."}, {"time": 6623, "text": "So clearly something like gold is very durable."}, {"time": 6625, "text": "It's resistant to degradation over time."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "Bitcoin is just pure information, but it's stored in a distributed format."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "So information stored in a

distributed information."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "And for that reason, it has outlasted empires."}, {"time": 6653, "text":

that it relies on computing infrastructure."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "Like it needs computers."}, {"time": 6668, "text": "So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world, it needs mechanisms that store and transfer information."}, {"time": 6677, "text": "And so you could attack it."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way, I suppose, through the

"text": "Maybe, I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "The other thing is there's a dynamic incentive."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners, you're creating incentives for anyone else with access to electricity to mine because you're making the algorithm easier."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "Yeah, so the destruction is difficult because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And the difficulty adjustment."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "Yeah, so you're gonna have to use nuclear weapons and cover the whole globe, but anyway."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "Yeah, and by then, we've got much bigger problems than money, right?"}, {"time": 6726, "text": "That's right, so okay, so that's durability."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "So portability, Bitcoin's pure information, it can move at the speed of light, can't get much faster than that."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "Recognizability refers to the ability to verify the veracity of the money or its authenticity."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So you can actually, when we used to transact gold, there were time honored techniques for verifying that it was gold and not gold plated lead, for instance."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "This is where we get the term sound money."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "A gold coin made a very particular sound when

cannot be faked."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "And in addition to that, as a node operator, you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time, which is unlike any money in history."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So you know with full certainty, if you're holding 1000 Bitcoin, you have 1000 out of a possible 21 million forever."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "Yeah, so a full node contains information about every transaction that's ever been had so you can figure out, yeah, I mean, all the truth of this money is all right there."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Yeah, it's like a fractal constituent of the whole network, right?"}, {"time": 6807, "text": "The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "Not the proof of work piece, but the entire transaction history."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And so that's unique as well."}, {"time": 6817, "text": "And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value is that you know with certainty what the total supply is and will ever be."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "And you know that your share of that supply is fixed."}, {"time": 6829,

making a contribution to everyone else."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "It's anti dilutive."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "And there's certain properties of Bitcoin that are sort of a little bit more into the details that ensure that the full nodes, like the size of all the transactions that ever happened, at least currently can be stored in a single computer, for example."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "So it doesn't blow up too quickly."}, {"time": 6868, "text": "But you know, there's arguments that that's not necessarily, you can make arguments for that to be a very nice property, but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it."}, {"time": 6878, "text": "That's hence the block size debates and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6882, "text": "Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "Was that particular piece."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "And, you know, ostensibly they were saying, oh, we need more transaction throughput to buy more coffee and do more transactions."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "But what they were actually doing was increasing the size computing power necessary to run a full node, which would have theoretically compromised decentralization."}, {"time": 6906, "text": "So yeah, but it would in theory, and this is, you know, in theory, it would allow you to have much more transactions."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "But the drawback, it would, because of no longer can be stored in a single computer, personal computer, then it naturally leads to the centralization."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Which you see with gold."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "Which would have compromised its survivability."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "So, I said, what else is there?"}, {"time": 6934, "text": "The last one, which leads straight into this one, actually is the most important one of money, which is scarcity."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "And that you need to know the supply is fixed and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,

counterfeiting."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "So central banks today, when they say they're printing money, they're not."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "They're counterfeiting currency."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "That's a very important part."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing, is more than just an invention."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "And that we have unveiled a property of money that we will only discover once, and it's got really major ramifications for the world at large."}, {"time": 6988, "text": "So with gold, for instance, as we've covered, it became money because it was the most relatively scarce monetary metal, right?"}, {"time": 6997, "text": "Its supply was hardest to increase over time."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "However, if we could somehow flip a switch today and make everyone in the world go out and start mining gold, we could increase the supply much more quickly."}, {"time": 7009, "text": "We could, you know, it's historic inflation rates about 2%, we could double that pretty quickly."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "So no matter how much effort and energy and capital and operational expenditure we pour into the mining network, we cannot deviate from its fixed and diminishing supply curve from between now and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140 because of the difficulty adjustment."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "It's constantly, it's adapting to human action actually."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes, and then the less we pursue it, the more available it makes itself."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "And this is, it's a real major breakthrough because it's the closest thing to perfect information we've ever had in an economy."}, {"time": 7057, "text": "And perfect information is this, it's a theoretical, but unattainable state of the market where all market actors have all the relevant information about everything so that they can compete as efficiently as possible."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "And in a state of pure information, we have, I'm sorry, perfect information, we have perfect competition."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation."}, {"time": 7083,

hold for other cryptocurrency technologies that followed after."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin is the superior technology from a pragmatic truth perspective than say Ethereum, but also other crypto, like Bitcoin Cash, like other hard forks of Bitcoin, and maybe things that might yet to be invented, tools yet to be invented?"}, {"time": 7141, "text": "Yeah, so this is a good point of argument because a lot of people have countered me and said, Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity because you can fork it and create something with the same properties as Bitcoin or potentially even better properties, right?"}, {"time": 7157, "text": "You create something with a deflationary monetary policy."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties except for the block size that we alluded to earlier."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "The problem is that money is valued."}, {"time": 7173, "text": "Again, it's the good with a configuration of demand that is predominantly marketability."}, {"time": 7180, "text": "So it is valued based on its liquidity."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "That is how many other trading partners are there in that monetary network."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "So it is a network valued because of its liquidity and network effects."}, {"time": 7194, "text": "So any new entrant into the market for money is incentivized to always choose the money with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects."}, {"time": 7206, "text": "This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market because it's essentially a single purpose tool, right?"}, {"time": 7213, "text": "It is a tool for, if we consider that tools are time saving devices, right?"}, {"time": 7219, "text": "The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour than you can with your bare hands."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "Money is a tool, there's yet another definition of money that lets us calculate, negotiate and execute trades more quickly."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "So that function tends to coalesce towards one solution."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "And so the short answer would be that for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right?"}, {"time": 7244, "text": "Like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects that we have one analog gold, we're only likely to have one digital gold."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork proves that out empirically."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "It's a good case study because."}, {"time": 7259, "text": "Well, it's one case study, right?"}, {"time": 7260, "text": "But okay, so that's really well put."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "So like gold was sticky."}, {"time": 7264, "text": "Once it was accepted, the network effects, the winner take all took over."}, {"time": 7271, "text": "And here's a fundamentally different kind of like analog versus digital is a leap in technologies."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "And you're suggesting that there may not be, there's unlikely to be other leaps of that kind into a whole nother kind of space of technologies."}, {"time": 7292, "text": "I would argue that Bitcoin, it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold, taking the monetary properties of gold and combining them with the internet itself."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "And in doing so, it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?"}, {"time": 7307, "text": "You can't get more divisible, durable, recognizable, portable, or scarce than Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "So Satoshi has kind of, he left no design space for a superior technology to intercede and out compete Bitcoin at this point."}, {"time": 7321, "text": "Now that it's established liquidity in the network effects."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "Far superior technology, right?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself and the social layer that is coalesced to it."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "You can't separate those two out."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Like they're all connected and then the political as well."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "I mean, but the portability, for example, that's another way to phrase that is the, what is it, the scaling."}, {"time": 7342, "text": "So the number of transactions, that's a limitation for Bitcoin that many argue is a feature, many argue is a bug."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies that are able to achieve much higher, much faster frequency of transactions, much more transactions, you know, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "You know, the low level of transactions that's possible with Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7371, "text": "Do you think that's a feature?"}, {"time": 7372, "text": "Do you think that's a bug?"}, {"time": 7374, "text": "Necessary for security actually."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "And even these other crypto assets that settle more quickly, they settle with less assurance of finality."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called, the settlement assurance is stupid."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "It's really good where the gist of it is that there is more work being done in each block of Bitcoin that it can't, it is less vulnerable to reversion."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "So it's giving you higher degrees of assurance that your settlement or your trade has occurred with finality, whereas other blockchains are much more vulnerable."}, {"time": 7411, "text": "And again, with Bitcoin, the evolutionary path of money with gold is that it was first used as a collectible."}, {"time": 7420, "text": "It then became used as a store value."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "After it had stored enough value, it began to be used as a medium of exchange."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "And then finally, when it was used widely enough as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "We actually start to think in the money."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "Bitcoin's following a similar path."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So started out as kind of a collectible."}, {"time": 7440, "text": "Today, I would argue it's a store value, one of the most effective store value we've ever seen."}, {"time": 7445, "text": "So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following is similar to gold."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "First a collectible, today a store value."}, {"time": 7452, "text": "To be an effective store value, it has to optimize for supply cap."}, {"time": 7458, "text": "That has to be the first, and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do to be successful by the way."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years, virtually flawlessly, which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million."}, {"time": 7474, "text": "As long as those two things hold, it is sound money, the ultimate sound money, the most inflation resistant money there's ever been."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "It's actually completely immune."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "We know with perfect certainty what Bitcoin supply will ever be."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange, it can't make trade offs at the base layer to increase its portability for instance."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "Even though portability is maybe kind of a misnomer because Bitcoin has extremely high portability, just doesn't have extremely high transaction throughput."}, {"time": 7513, "text": "So we could say you can move it pretty quickly anywhere in the world as long as you're willing to bid up for the block space, but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "You can't do 300 million transactions per second like you can on a centralized database like Visa."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "But Bitcoin needs to be this, it has to be a store value first before it can be a medium of exchange."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "So it has to protect the supply cap first before making any trade offs for that."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid, is that it's optimized for survivability and optimized for that supply cap."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "And it's pushing experimentation and other features that would increase its transaction throughput to higher layers."}, {"time": 7559, "text": "So I think Lightning Network is something that's very interesting."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "It's still early, but there's a lot of throughput already being used on the Lightning Network."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And it makes some slight trade offs in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "You end up trusting these smart contracts instead of move the Bitcoin, but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "So that's how, and that's how biology evolves."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "That's how the internet evolved."}, {"time": 7586, "text": "It evolves in layers."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "So I think Bitcoin, you can sort of conceive of it as the latest layer to the internet."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And it's one that preserves this store value property better than any asset we've ever had."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "Let me ask sort of a critical question of, if you're wrong about your statements about Bitcoin, and you find out years from now that you were wrong, what would that look like?"}, {"time": 7614, "text": "What would be the things that make you realize you were wrong?"}, {"time": 7617, "text": "Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?"}, {"time": 7621, "text": "Do you think about this kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 7624, "text": "Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7628, "text": "And one of the

wrong or you're wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?"}, {"time": 7673, "text": "Yeah, so science evolves via negativa, meaning that we're not proving hypotheses and that's what becomes the body of science."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "Science is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "Whatever we can empirically, through experimentation, disprove, gets

he say that?"}, {"time": 7783, "text": "Dalio was currently stuck there, yeah."}, {"time": 7785, "text": "So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising."}, {"time": 7792, "text": "If it is

it."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?"}, {"time": 7810, "text": "And how do you get unstuck from that idea that governments, will governments, how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing that threatens centralized power?"}, {"time": 7822, "text": "Well, Bitcoin is an idea."}, {"time": 7826, "text": "So governments that are really good at fighting centralized threats to their power, right?"}, {"time": 7835, "text": "Whether that's a currency counterfeiter or competing nation state or business they don't like, or an individual they don't like, you know, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "They can use any number of course of a violent tactics to suppress it."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "But how do you point a gun at an idea?"}, {"time": 7852, "text": "How do you coerce an idea?"}, {"time": 7856, "text": "And that's, you know, there's some anecdotal history here where there's the PGP case, which in the United States, the court was trying to classify it as munitions."}, {"time": 7872, "text": "When we were shipping this pretty good privacy software overseas, government wanted to classify it as munitions and restrict that exportation."}, {"time": 7882, "text": "But, and this was a circuit court case precedent."}, {"time": 7885, "text": "When the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code on paper and presented it as evidence in the court, all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech and that it's just code is speech, code is language."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "And therefore, at least in the United States, it's protected under the first amendment."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable, frankly, on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "Being that it's pure information, if you suppress market actors from using it in one jurisdiction, you're just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "And you're actually increasing the incentive for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it because then they can create, they get to benefit from the tax revenue and the businesses and the innovation that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result."}, {"time": 7939, "text": "So you don't think if a particular central bank, like in Europe or United States, bans it, not maybe using those terms, but in some kind of way, you think that provides a really strong incentive for the other big players to enable it."}, {"time": 7958, "text": "And that they're more likely, by the way, and governments know this, by the way, too."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "The other thing that causes a government to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something, they draw a lot of attention to it."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "People are smart."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?"}, {"time": 7973, "text": "Why can't I use this?"},

7984, "text": "And the power structures that they impose today start to dissolve faster than others might think they will, then they might try and ban it."}, {"time": 7993, "text": "But I think that

getting their pound of flesh on all the transactions it results in."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "But I don't think, the other thing about this is, so we saw the internet outcompete intranets, in that we'd say that open source networks tend to outcompete closed source networks."}, {"time": 8037, "text": "And there's a really good reason for this."}, {"time": 8039, "text": "And it's because in a closed source network, there are costs associated with defending the network itself."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "So you have to, the network owners, the owners of the closed source network have to expend resources protecting it from competitors."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "And they have to expend resources imposing its rules because they're not voluntarily adopted rules."}, {"time": 8063, "text": "So you actually have to impose these rule sets."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "Whereas an open source network, which is something much more akin to capitalism in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules."}, {"time": 8073, "text": "So all market participants have agreed and consented to this rule set."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "So there's no enforcement costs and there's no turf protection because anyone can freely enter or exit the open network."}, {"time": 8083, "text": "For that energetic reason, I think open networks outcompete close networks typically."}, {"time": 8090, "text": "And in the digital age, that's why I think open, that's why internet outcompetes intranet and that's why open source networks are gonna eat closed source networks."}, {"time": 8098,

there's no possibility of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it."}, {"time": 8123, "text": "And again, the other fallacy here is that a lot of people tend to think of governments as these singular indivisible entities, like they just move under one plan."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "But in reality, it's a lot of people, right?"}, {"time": 8134, "text": "A lot of people with loosely coupled interests and agendas and whatnot, regulators and others whether wearing their citizen hat, they're gonna see this thing monetizing, they're gonna be on the front lines of trying to regulate it, trying to control it."}, {"time": 8152, "text": "And I think what's likely to happen is they're gonna start to adopt it, to buy some of it even as an individual or possibly even ultimately at a central bank or sovereign wealth fund level, as an insurance policy against its success."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "And once you start to acquire something and then you have a vested economic interest in its monetization, I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures that are arrayed against it from the inside."},

the general thesis is that microprocessing technology would devour our organizational models, the most important of which is the nation state."}, {"time": 8198, "text": "So I think we're going into this world where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "The economics of violence are declining because of the low cost of protecting property, right?"}, {"time": 8214, "text": "You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin at orders of magnitude less cost than is necessary to run a banking network."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "So it changes the way we organize ourselves."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "And again, zooming back to gold as kind of the original governor to governments, where if they manipulated the money, gold would leave their country."}, {"time": 8238, "text": "That's why governments have taken relatively concerted action to go off of the gold standard."}, {"time": 8245, "text": "There's a great book on this called The

governments."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "And that is this digital gold that governments cannot stop or coopt."}, {"time": 8265, "text": "So I think it's something, that's why I think it's such a big deal is that it is changing, it's a new useful fiction, you might say."}, {"time": 8276, "text": "A useful fiction that's superordinate to the mythology of the nation state and government as the dominant institution in the world."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "Well, I hope you're right that all forms of centralized power start breaking apart naturally."}, {"time": 8292, "text": "So governments, the more and more power is given to the individual, whatever the technology is."}, {"time": 8298, "text": "And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology that empowers that, enables that."}, {"time":

consciousness."}, {"time": 8314, "text": "I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam in human history, which is political authority."}, {"time": 8320, "text": "Like who gives anyone the right to be

that, let me bring up one quick topic and then we'll take a break."}, {"time": 8371, "text": "And the topic of what some may term the toxicity of the Bitcoin community."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "You've written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love."}, {"time": 8384, "text": "Do you wanna break that apart a little bit sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?"}, {"time": 8398, "text": "Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit before we recorded and I've been through the gauntlet with Bitcoin toxicity as well."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "I came into this space professionally in 2017."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "I was originally running a multi strategy crypto asset hedge fund."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "And my initial investment thesis on the world was that Bitcoin was a big deal, but there were all these other exciting coins and projects and ways the technology was going to be used."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "And that view of reality met this immune, I guess you could say as an ideological immune system, this Bitcoin toxicity and that it's kind of a filter that's trying to catch bad or useless or even scamming ideas that this space is very well known for."}, {"time": 8452, "text": "As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion, is this world shattering innovation, but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever, right?"}, {"time": 8461, "text": "People, anybody can go and create a coin."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "So you can go and launch one immediately online and you can throw up a website, an advisor page, post a white paper talking about how great your technology is gonna be and how it's gonna change the world."}, {"time": 8477, "text": "And then you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say."}, {"time": 8487, "text": "And I think people living through that, because there is this natural predilection for people when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it, then you get lost in the shit coin universe."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "And then just looking at the market success of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word shit coin, I'm just."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "You say with all the love in the world."}, {"time": 8509, "text": "All the love in the world."}, {"time": 8510, "text": "I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways, although I consider myself a freedom maximalist, not a Bitcoin maximalist."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "Yeah, I saw that line, that's a good line."}, {"time": 8519, "text": "Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin versus alternative crypto assets, the signal is very clear that Bitcoin has out competed all of them."}, {"time": 8529, "text": "So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved as an immune response to those bad ideas, which is actually, if you think about it, kind of is a tough love, right?"}, {"time": 8539, "text": "You don't want new entrance to the space to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way, the way many Bitcoin maximalists have that the real innovation is Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space from false narratives, we might say, but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people that are inquiring about Bitcoin or people that are approaching Bitcoin with a good spirit and good intention and a desire to learn."}, {"time": 8577, "text": "Because then at that point, it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas, which the example in your clip that was totally taken out of context."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "And then you're literally just saying, I'm here to learn and contribute."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "I think I've got some stuff to do."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "And then people attack that."}, {"time": 8591, "text": "Like that doesn't make any fucking sense."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "It's like you're attacking someone who's approaching it in a good spirit and asking questions."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it, the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response has a negative effect of giving it a pass because like it almost says, look, it equates it with the human immune system, which seems to do a really good job."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features in the sea of fraudulent projects that steal money from people."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "It's really useful to make sure that you give people the harsh truth about who is and isn't a scammer."}, {"time": 8640, "text": "You have to take it apart, take it away from that metaphor of the immune system and look at basic human nature."}, {"time": 8646, "text": "And human nature can go to some dark places, which is it's sad to say that some people, maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity, the mockery, the derision, and you stop being part of the immune system that makes a successful idea propagate and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "And that's something I think about because I am new to this particular immune system, but I've explored other immune systems."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "And I think you understand this world much better than me, but I tend to prefer sort of love as a mechanism for spreading ideas, to err on the side of love and kindness and almost like an open mindedness in a way where you're constantly lowering yourself in the face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "But I think I understand that that might be more applicable in certain contexts, like maybe in the space of science or something like that."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands, there's so many people that are trying to scam others out of their money that the kind of harshness required is different."}, {"time": 8739, "text": "Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself and others who I know you wouldn't consider yourself this, but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space to call people out a little bit, to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose."}, {"time": 8757, "text": "But it's difficult, because you want to walk that line carefully."}, {"time": 8760, "text": "You don't want to be too loving and open minded, otherwise your brain falls out."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "I get it, it's a difficult balance to walk."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "It is subtle and it's nuanced and it is difficult to walk."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "And I think that, that's why I try to say tough love, because when we're young, we may have certain ideas about the way we want our life to go, but then maybe our parents are not letting us do certain things."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "And we think they're, I know when I was a kid, I wanted to get my, when I was in fifth grade, I wanted to get my ear pierced."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "My mom wouldn't let me do it."}, {"time": 8791, "text": "And I was, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, mom, for letting me get my ear pierced."}, {"time": 8799, "text": "I think it comes from a place of good intention that they are actually, they have asked themselves that question, right?"}, {"time": 8806, "text": "That they've been inquiring in why not this crypto asset or this crypto asset?"}, {"time": 8811, "text": "And they've done the exploration, they keep coming back to Bitcoin and they've seen people being taken advantage of."}, {"time": 8819, "text": "But to your point, it's like it can, this tough love can become detrimental, just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?"}, {"time": 8828, "text": "It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "So I would say that it's such a tricky and nuanced topic that even biology hasn't figured it out, right?"}, {"time": 8838, "text": "A lot of people have autoimmune diseases."}, {"time": 8841, "text": "And then there's the other thing that we have this natural, I agree with you about love."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "I think love is like the deepest value."}, {"time": 8848, "text": "That's a whole nother philosophical thing, but we're biologically programmed to pay more attention to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?"}, {"time": 8858, "text": "That's part of us protecting the meat suit, so to speak."}, {"time": 8862, "text": "So there is some maybe better delivery method by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across, like, hey, don't get lost over here."}, {"time": 8873, "text": "These things can hurt you."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "Really try to focus on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8877, "text": "But the toxicity of that message, I guess it increases its ability to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far."}, {"time": 8884, "text": "So it is very..."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "It's interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit, toxicity is a funny word."}, {"time": 8891, "text": "I think maybe another way to say it is, I brought up like Christopher Hitchens and somebody who like, okay, you might say he's toxic or something like that, because he's basically a intellectual powerhouse who's also a troll."}, {"time": 8908, "text": "So he's constantly, it's like guerrilla warfare in the space of ideas."}, {"time": 8913, "text": "He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms, but he's done with incredible grace and skill and poetry."}, {"time": 8922, "text": "So... We could use more of that."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "We could use more of that."}, {"time": 8925, "text": "So toxicity just like..."}, {"time": 8932, "text": "These are just words."}, {"time": 8933, "text": "They can mean a lot of different things, but disagreement doesn't have to be done with love, but it should be done with skill if it's to be effective."}, {"time": 8944, "text": "So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare, but you wanna learn how to shoot or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well."}, {"time": 8952, "text": "Some people do it better than others."}, {"time": 8954, "text": "And it's worthwhile to learn to do it well."}, {"time": 8957, "text": "Again, I prefer love, but even love, just because you think you're communicating a good idea, which you very well may be, doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill to do the communication well, whether it's disagreement and harsh or more agreement and loving and so on."}, {"time": 8976, "text": "Yeah, I think very fundamentally that all of our decisions, we alluded to earlier that every decision is an expression of value, every action we take, they ultimately come from fear or love."}, {"time": 8989, "text": "Fear would be something much more in the biological domain where it's like, we're trying to protect ego, we're trying to behave selfishly."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "This is the domain of sin."}, {"time": 9001, "text": "I don't know all the sins, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, pride, envy, these are all selfish behaviors."}, {"time": 9007, "text": "Whereas something like love, it's morally superior in that it's more selfless."}, {"time": 9014, "text": "I don't know that we can properly define love with words at all, but I would say maybe like selfless action could be kind of a generalization of it."}, {"time": 9022, "text": "And that way, it is really hard to your point."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "It's hard to love in a world that has a lot of conflict that might make you fearful if you're really focused on your meat suit."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "But if you're focused on the bigger picture and you're focused on others and legacy and life, that there is a way to do it."}, {"time": 9043, "text": "And that's why I actually think Christ, that is the highest moral aim, right?"}, {"time": 9046, "text": "He met all of the vitriol in life, betrayal, hate, violence, he met it all with love and he met it with compassion."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "And that's why, regardless of if you believe that he actually lived or any of this, he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "And Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable alternative to psychoanalysis, was actually setting your moral aim higher and striving towards it diligently."}, {"time": 9076, "text": "So, I mean, I agree completely."}, {"time": 9080, "text": "We need more of that in the Bitcoin space."}, {"time": 9082, "text": "We need more of that in the world, frankly."}, {"time": 9084, "text": "In the world, yeah."}, {"time": 9084, "text": "And these things, they're all intertwined."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide, but the world does influence what we do."}, {"time": 9094, "text": "It does influence kind of if we adopt fear or love, but it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example."}, {"time": 9105, "text": "Yeah, I do believe that there's like individual people can have a ripple effect."}, {"time": 9110, "text": "So that's what I try to do, sort of embody the, I'm just one ant."}, {"time": 9115, "text": "But one of the things I have faith in is, I'm trying to do that more."}, {"time": 9122, "text": "I know this is a podcast, but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing."}, {"time": 9130, "text": "I've been disappointed in myself, if I'm being honest, how much talking I've been doing, as opposed to, like in my own private life, I live the thing I talk about, but I also haven't created much."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "And I believe in the power of individuals that create stuff, like create an idea through those individuals that try to create something new, the world progresses."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "And hopefully there's more and more, more and more of those people."}, {"time": 9159,

really fall in love with."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "So how is a person like me supposed to figure out, I also happen to have a platform a little bit, and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting, what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?"}, {"time": 9205, "text": "Because people are financially tied into a lot of the cryptocurrencies that we're talking about, certainly with Bitcoin, you know, their livelihood, their wellbeing is tied up to it."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal."}, {"time": 9217, "text": "It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "It's really almost like a threat on your property."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "Like it's a personal threat and it makes it very difficult to explore those ideas."}, {"time": 9227, "text": "So I understand that, but it makes it very difficult for somebody like me to just walk in and be curious."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "So how do I proceed in this difficult world in exploring this landscape and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?"}, {"time": 9250, "text": "I guess first I'd like to commend your forthrightness about this,

the sun, right?"}, {"time": 10575, "text": "So it's allocating energy towards its goal of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing."}, {"time": 10580, "text": "So, and humans too have evolved to figure out how to harness energy in different ways to satisfy higher and more complicated aims."}, {"time": 10595, "text": "So the original energy network that he referenced was fire, right?"}, {"time": 10601, "text": "We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself."}, {"time": 10605, "text": "So not only are we learning to channel energy, but we're actually learning how to isolate energy as a tool in and of itself."}, {"time": 10613, "text": "And so we went into that, how harnessing fire had changed human beings."}, {"time": 10619, "text": "And actually, this is one of the earliest examples too of a coevolution between tool and our biology, because when we developed fire, we developed cooking."}, {"time": 10631, "text": "And cooking is, you can kind of think of it as pre digestion in a way."}, {"time": 10634, "text": "We're liberating these macronutrients or making things that otherwise would not be digestible, edible."}, {"time": 10642, "text": "And it increases the efficiency by which we extract nutrients from food."}, {"time": 10646, "text": "That's what cooking does."}, {"time": 10647, "text": "So when we figured out cooking, we liberated all these digestive resources that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development."}, {"time": 10656, "text": "So there's this evolutionary path between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter, which is interesting."}, {"time": 10665, "text": "Some other early examples he gave, he went into were missiles and hydraulics."}, {"time": 10671, "text": "So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance."}, {"time": 10676, "text": "We can't bring down a wooly mammoth, maybe with spears and up close and personal force, but we could with spears and javelins and slings and whatnot."}, {"time": 10687, "text": "And then he went into how we've used water to channel hydraulic energy."}, {"time": 10692, "text": "So we can basically overcome gravity."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "We can move, there's theories that the pyramids were constructed using, the blocks were moved using hydraulic energy or using water."}, {"time": 10705, "text": "Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot to move things much more efficiently across water than we could the land."}, {"time": 10712, "text": "So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it."}, {"time": 10720, "text": "And in that perspective, money has always represented a claim on all other forms of energy."}, {"time": 10728, "text": "So whatever energy couldn't be channeled towards something useful in the economy historically would go into gold mining."}, {"time": 10735, "text": "So gold became this residual, this economic, this token of the excess energy created by the market economy."}, {"time": 10745, "text": "And then you could take that token of energy and use it to redeem for any other form of energy or any of the products of energy itself."}, {"time": 10753, "text": "So it's, I guess it's my best approximation of it."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "And it just really shattered my worldview again, because I'd always thought about it as time."}, {"time": 10763, "text": "Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices from others, but I'd never considered it purely as energy."}, {"time": 10772, "text": "And then

emerges through competition and play even."}, {"time": 11056, "text": "There are these implicit rules that come into place based on how we're organizing ourselves over time."}, {"time": 11063, "text":

thing."}, {"time": 11101, "text": "But money's maybe a little bit different in that when you monopolize money, it's only useful as a tool for one thing."}, {"time": 11115, "text": "And that's for

society."}, {"time": 11155, "text": "So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings, which could be time, could be capital, it could be knowledge from any market actor in the world."}, {"time": 11164,

choices."}, {"time": 11374, "text": "And an important point here too, before we get into his three choices, are what prices are themselves."}, {"time": 11379, "text": "Prices are the most visible aspect of any service."}, {"time": 11383, "text": "So when you increase prices, you're incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere."}, {"time": 11389, "text": "They're gonna look at your competition."}, {"time": 11391, "text": "When you decrease prices, you're incentivizing market actors to look closer at your product, right?"}, {"time": 11397, "text": "You're delivering a solution at a lower price."}, {"time": 11400, "text": "So this wine maker that's accustomed to selling his wine at a $20 price point, all of a sudden, because of a central bank has tripled the money supply, he has three choices."}, {"time": 11410, "text": "He can either keep selling his bottle at $20 and all of his inputs will increase due to inflation by 50%."}, {"time": 11419, "text": "So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result."}, {"time": 11424, "text": "So he can choose to eat that loss."}, {"time": 11426, "text": "He can choose to double the selling price of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40, because all of the price of his inputs doubled."}, {"time": 11433, "text": "So then he would maintain his profit margin."}, {"time": 11436, "text": "Or the third one is that he could choose to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients."}, {"time": 11444, "text": "So he could use cheaper inputs and maintain the output at the same price."}, {"time": 11451, "text": "So he could basically start selling his customers an inferior product for the same price to preserve his profit margin."}, {"time": 11457, "text": "Now, again, case number one, it's not very palatable."}, {"time": 11461,

the social, like the social fabric."}, {"time": 11620, "text": "And I guess you're arguing the morality."}, {"time": 11623, "text": "It's perverting free market dynamics, which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth."}, {"time": 11629, "text": "So inflation distorts price signals, which means it confuses capital allocation."}, {"time": 11634, "text": "So we're trying to solve problems, but all of a sudden we can't tell if this price increase is a matter of true supply and demand change or a matter of policy change."}, {"time": 11643, "text": "So it clouds our economic

projects that they can't profitably sustain."}, {"time": 11656, "text": "So then there'll be a huge collapse."}, {"time": 11658, "text": "So that actually breaks the market's function of generating

so."}, {"time": 11673, "text": "It's not as clear to me, perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply, that money is core to life and human interaction because there might be other forces, other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature that are creating these effects as well."}, {"time": 11691, "text": "So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well that there's these negative effects from inflation."}, {"time": 11696, "text": "I wonder if there's other undiscovered, not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit now, forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now with, like you said, cancer culture and all those things, but also the negative effects on the quality of products, on the excellence of the creativity and the innovation, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 11721, "text": "I wonder if there's other factors."}, {"time": 11723, "text": "It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money's at the core of it all."}, {"time": 11728,

"text": "Again, things that sound good, I'm skeptical of by nature."}, {"time": 11740, "text": "So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature."}, {"time": 11747, "text": "Another one related to money is social cohesion itself."}, {"time": 11751, "text": "So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase the inflation rate, social cohesion is inversely proportionate to that."}, {"time": 11762, "text": "So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?"}, {"time": 11764, "text": "Where the money is produced in such excess that it loses all meaning and relevance."}, {"time": 11769, "text": "So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters, clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system, because the cash has lost all relevance."}, {"time": 11781, "text": "And so anecdotally, we would suspect that, okay, if there's a inverse relationship between inflation and social cohesion, if we could then take inflation to zero, couldn't we theoretically increase social cohesion to its maximum?"}, {"time": 11798, "text": "So another way to say that is inflation is a decivilizing force, whereas natural price deflation, which would occur in a hard money economy, where there's either a fixed supply of Bitcoin or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance, that lays claim to an increasing capital stock of goods and services, prices would naturally decline every year as we became smarter."}, {"time": 11826, "text": "So the market price becomes a reflection of our collective knowledge."}, {"time": 11829, "text": "So by letting prices decline naturally over time, we can actually induce civilization."}, {"time": 11836, "text": "But by trying to force prices higher all the time via the central bank, we're creating the opposite effect."}, {"time": 11841, "text": "So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union, and I happened to have lived through the collapse of the Soviet Union."},

Stalin eliminated, I think 75% of his intelligence force, which I think when you're competing with another nation state, you know, and intelligence and covert operations are very integral to your survival, I think that was definitely a shot in the foot."}, {"time": 11893, "text": "But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism and communism were each resource strategies of the 20th century

"text": "The difference would be that in Soviet Russia, as we alluded to earlier, they tried to completely replace price signals with this nationalistic faith and devotion."}, {"time": 11926, "text":

"text": "Whereas in the United States, we left most markets open to free enterprise."}, {"time": 11942, "text": "So we honored the integrity of price signals and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth."}, {"time": 11951, "text": "So in every market, except the market for money, both markets maintained a central bank as we've gotten to."}, {"time": 11958, "text": "So I think in a really big picture standpoint, that's why capitalism outcompetes communism is because it is able to generate more wealth than communism was, and therefore was able to put financial pressure on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy, essentially."}, {"time": 11981, "text": "A similar model, I would argue, is that for the same reasons we saw capitalism outcompete communism, which I think the data that I recall was that the USSR's economy was valued at close to one third of its inputs."}, {"time": 11999, "text": "So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it, it would have been worth three times as much as sending the materials in, running it through the efforts and then shipping things back out."}, {"time":
