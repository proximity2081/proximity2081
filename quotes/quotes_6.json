there's a car in front of me, but to help people build an intuition of what computer vision is by showing some of the uncertainty."}, {"time": 353, "text": "Well, I think it's, in my car, I always look at the sort of the debug view."}, {"time": 357, "text": "And there's, there's two debug views."}, {"time": 359, "text": "Uh, one is augmented vision, uh, where, which I'm sure you've seen where it's basically, we draw boxes and labels around objects that are recognized."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And then there's a work called the visualizer, which is basically vector space representation, summing up the input from all sensors that doesn't, that doesn't, does not show any pictures, but it shows, uh, all of the, it's basically shows the car's view of, of, of the world in vector space."}, {"time": 392, "text": "Um, but I think this is very difficult for people to know, normal people to understand, they would not know what they're looking at."}, {"time": 399, "text": "So it's almost an HMI challenge to the current things that are being displayed is optimized for the general public understanding of what the system is capable of."}, {"time": 408, "text": "It's like, if you have no idea what, how computer vision works or anything, you can sort of look at the screen and see if the car knows what's going on."}, {"time": 415, "text": "And then if you're, you know, if you're a development engineer or if you're, you know, if you're, if you have the development build like I do, then you can see, uh, you know, all the debug information, but those would just be like total diverse to most people."}, {"time": 431, "text": "What's your view on how to best distribute effort."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So there's three, I would say technical aspects of autopilot that are really important."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So it's the underlying algorithms, like the neural network architecture, there's the data, so that the strain on, and then there's a hardware development."}, {"time": 446, "text": "There may be others, but so look, algorithm, data, hardware, you don't, you only have so much money, only have so much time, what do you think is the most important thing to, to, uh, allocate resources to, or do you see it as pretty evenly distributed between those three?"}, {"time": 463, "text": "We automatically get a fast amounts of data because all of our cars have eight external facing cameras and radar, and usually 12 ultrasonic sensors, uh, GPS, obviously, um, and, uh, IMU."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And so we basically have a fleet that has, uh, and we've got about 400,000 cars on the road that have that level of data, I think you keep quite close track of it actually."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So we're, we're approaching half a million cars on the road that have the full sensor suite."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Um, so this is, I'm, I'm not sure how many other cars on the road have the sensor suite, but I would be surprised if it's more than 5,000, which means that we have 99% of all the data."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So there's this huge inflow of data."}, {"time": 517, "text": "Massive inflow of data, and then we, it's, it's taken us about three years, but now we've finally developed our full self driving computer, which can process, uh, and in order of magnitude as much as the Nvidia system that we currently have in the, in the cars, and it's really just a, to use it, you've unplugged the Nvidia computer and plug the Tesla computer in and that's it."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And it's, it's, uh, in fact, we're not even, we're still exploring the boundaries of capabilities, uh, but we're able to run the cameras at full frame rate, full resolution, uh, not even crop the images and it's still got headroom even on one of the systems, the harder full self driving computer is really two computers, two systems on a chip that are fully redundant."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So you could put a bolt through basically any part of that system and it still works."}, {"time": 567, "text": "The redundancy, are they perfect copies of each other or also it's purely for redundancy as opposed to an argue machine kind of architecture where they're both making decisions."}, {"time": 577, "text": "This is purely for redundancy."}, {"time": 579, "text": "I think it would more like it's, if you have a twin engine aircraft, uh, commercial aircraft, the system will operate best if both systems are operating, but it's, it's capable of operating safely on one."}, {"time": 593, "text": "So, but as it is right now, we can just run, we're, we haven't even hit the, the, the edge of performance."}, {"time": 601, "text": "So there's no need to actually distribute functionality across both SOCs."}, {"time": 610, "text": "We can actually just run a full duplicate on, on, on each one."}, {"time": 613, "text": "Do you haven't really explored or hit the limit of this?"}, {"time": 617, "text": "Not yet at the limiter."}, {"time": 618, "text": "So the magic of deep learning is that it gets better with data."}, {"time": 622, "text": "You said there's a huge inflow of data, but the thing about driving the really valuable data to learn from is the edge cases."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So how do you, I mean, I've, I've heard you talk somewhere about, uh, autopilot disengagements being an important moment of time to use."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Is there other edge cases where you can, you know, you can, you can, you can drive, is there other edge cases or perhaps can you speak to those edge cases?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "What aspects of that might be valuable or if you have other ideas, how to discover more and more and more edge cases in driving?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "Well, there's a lot of things that are learned."}, {"time": 662, "text": "There are certainly edge cases where I say somebody is on autopilot and they, they take over and then, okay, that, that, that, that's a trigger that goes to our system that says, okay, did they take over for convenience or do they take over because the autopilot wasn't working properly."}, {"time": 679, "text": "There's also like, let's say we're, we're trying to figure out what is the optimal spline for traversing an intersection."}, {"time": 687, "text": "Um, then then the ones where there are no interventions and are the right ones."}, {"time": 693, "text": "So you then say, okay, when it looks like this, do the following."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And then, and then you get the optimal spline for a complex, uh, navigating a complex, uh, intersection."}, {"time": 704, "text": "So that's for this."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So there's kind of the common case you're trying to, uh, capture a huge amount of samples of a particular intersection, how, when things went right, and then there's the edge case where, uh, as you said, not for convenience, but something didn't go exactly right."}, {"time": 721, "text": "Somebody took over, somebody asserted manual control from autopilot."}, {"time": 725, "text": "And really like the way to look at this as view all input is error."}, {"time": 728, "text": "If the user had to do input, it does something all input is error."}, {"time": 732, "text": "That's a powerful line."}, {"time": 733, "text": "That's a powerful line to think of it that way, because they may very well be error, but if you want to exit the highway, or if you want to, uh, it's a navigation decision that all autopilot is not currently designed to do."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Then the driver takes over."}, {"time": 747, "text": "How do you know the difference?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "That's going to change with navigate an autopilot, which we were just released and without still confirm."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So the navigation, like lane change based, like a certain control in order to change, do a lane change or exit a freeway or, or doing a highway under change, the vast majority of that will go away with, um, the release that just went out."}, {"time": 769, "text": "So that, that I don't think people quite understand how big of a step that is."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Yeah, they don't."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So if you drive the car, then you do."}, {"time": 778, "text": "So you still have to keep your hands on the steering wheel currently when it does the automatic lane change."}, {"time": 783, "text": "What are, so there's, there's these big leaps through the development of autopilot through its history and what stands out to you as the big leaps?"}, {"time": 793, "text": "I would say this one, navigate an autopilot without, uh, confirm without having to confirm is a huge leap."}, {"time": 801, "text": "It is a huge leap."}, {"time": 802, "text": "It also automatically overtakes low cars."}, {"time": 804, "text": "So it's, it's both navigation, um, and seeking the fastest lane."}, {"time": 811, "text": "So it'll, it'll, it'll, you know, overtake a slow cause, um, and exit the freeway and take highway interchanges."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And, and then, uh, we have, uh, traffic lights, uh, recognition, which introduced initially as a, as a warning."}, {"time": 830, "text": "I mean, on the development version that I'm driving, the car fully, fully stops and goes at traffic lights."}, {"time": 836, "text": "So those are the steps, right?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "You've just mentioned something sort of inkling a step towards full autonomy."}, {"time": 842, "text": "What would you say are the biggest technological roadblocks to full self driving?"}, {"time": 848, "text": "Actually, I don't think, I think we just, the full self driving computer that we just, uh, that the Tesla, what we call the FSD computer, uh, that that's now in production."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Uh, so if you order, uh, any model SRX or any model three that has the full self driving package, you'll get the FSD computer."}, {"time": 869, "text": "That, that was, that's important to have enough, uh, base computation, uh, then refining the neural net and the control software, uh, which, but all of that can just be provided as an over there update."}, {"time": 913, "text": "So essentially buying a car today is an investment in the future."}, {"time": 916, "text": "You're essentially buying a car, you're buying the, I think the most profound thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating asset, not a depreciating asset."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So that's a really important statement there because if hardware is capable enough, that's the hard thing to upgrade usually."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So then the rest is a software problem."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Software has no marginal cost really."}, {"time": 944, "text": "But what's your intuition on the software side?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "How hard are the remaining steps to, to get it to where, um, you know, uh, the, the experience, uh, not just the safety, but the full experience is something that people would, uh, enjoy."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Well, I think people enjoy it very much so on, on, on the highways."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "In terms of enjoyability and something that people would, uh, would actually find a lot of use from the parking lot is a, is a really, you know, it's, it's rich of annoyance when you have to do it manually."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So there's a lot of benefit to be gained from automation there."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So let me start injecting the human into this discussion a little bit."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Uh, so let's talk about, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, about full autonomy."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "If you look at the current level four vehicles being tested on road, like Waymo and so on, they're only technically autonomous."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "They're really level two systems with just the different design philosophy, because there's always a safety driver in almost all cases and they're monitoring the system."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Do you see Tesla's full self driving as still for a time to come requiring supervision of the human being."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "So it's capabilities are powerful enough to drive, but nevertheless requires the human to still be supervising, just like a safety driver is in a other fully autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least, uh, six months or something like that from here."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It really is a question of like, from a regulatory standpoint, uh, what, how much safer than a person does autopilot need to be for it to be okay to not monitor the car, you know, and, and this is a debate that one can have it."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "And then if you, but you need, you know, a large sample, a large amount of data."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Um, so you can prove with high confidence, statistically speaking, that the car is dramatically safer than a person, um, and that adding in the person monitoring does not materially affect the safety."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So it might need to be like two or 300% safer than a person."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "And how do you prove that incidents per mile incidents per mile crashes and fatalities, fatalities would be a factor, but there, there are just not enough fatalities to be statistically significant at scale, but there are enough."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Crashes, you know, there are far more crashes than there are fatalities."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So you can assess what is the probability of a crash that then there's another step which probability of injury and probability of permanent injury, the probability of death, and all of those need to be a much better than a person, uh, by at least perhaps 200%."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And you think there's, uh, the ability to have a healthy discourse with the regulatory bodies on this topic?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "I mean, there's no question that, um, but, um, regulators pay just disproportionate amount of attention to that, which generates press."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "This is just an objective fact."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Um, and Tesla generates a lot of press."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So the, you know, in the United States, this, I think almost, you know, uh, in the United States, this, I think almost 40,000 automotive deaths per year."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Uh, but if there are four in Tesla, they'll probably receive a thousand times more press than anyone else."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So the, the psychology of that is actually fascinating."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I don't think we'll have enough time to talk about that, but I have to talk to you about the human side of things."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "So myself and our team at MIT recently released the paper on functional vigilance of drivers while using autopilot."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "This is work we've been doing since autopilot was first released publicly over three years ago, collecting video of driver faces and driver body."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "So I saw that you tweeted a quote from the abstract, so I can at least, uh, guess that you've glanced at it."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Yeah, I read it."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "Can I talk you through what we found?"}, {"time": 1246, "text": "So it appears that in the data that we've collected, that drivers are maintaining functional vigilance such that we're looking at 18,000 disengagement from autopilot, 18,900 and annotating, were they able to take over control in a timely manner?"}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So they were there present looking at the road, uh, to take over control."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So this, uh, goes against what, what many would predict from the body of literature on vigilance with automation."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Now, the question is, do you think these results hold across the broader population?"}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So ours is just a small subset."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Do you think, uh, one of the criticism is that, you know, there's a small minority of drivers that may be highly responsible where their vigilance decrement would increase with autopilot use?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I think this is all really going to be swept."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "I mean, the system's improving so much, so fast that this is going to be a mood point very soon where vigilance is like, if something's many times safer than a person, then adding a person, uh, does the, the, the effect on safety is, is limited."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Um, and in fact, uh, it could be negative."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So the, uh, the, so the fact that a human may, some percent of the population may, uh, exhibit a vigilance decrement will not affect overall statistics numbers of safety."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "No, in fact, I think it will become, uh, very, very quickly, maybe even towards the end of this year, but I'd say I'd be shocked if it's not next year."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "At the latest, that, um, having the person, having a human intervene will decrease safety decrease."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "It's like, imagine if you're an elevator and it used to be that there were elevator operators, um, and, and you couldn't go on an elevator by yourself and work the lever to move between floors."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "Um, and now, uh, nobody wants it an elevator operator because the automated elevator that stops the floors is much safer than the elevator operator."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And in fact, it would be quite dangerous to have someone with a lever that can move the elevator between floors."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So that's a, that's a really powerful statement and really interesting one."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "But I also have to ask from a user experience and from a safety perspective, one of the passions for me algorithmically is a camera based detection of, uh, of just sensing the human, but detecting what the driver is looking at, cognitive load, body pose on the computer vision side, that's a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "But do you, and there's many in industry believe you have to have camera based driver monitoring."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Do you think there could be benefit gained from driver monitoring?"}, {"time": 1419, "text": "If you have a system that's, that's at, that's at or below a human level reliability, then driver monitoring makes sense."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But if your system is dramatically better, more likely to be better, more liable than, than a human, then drive monitoring monitoring is not just not help much."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And, uh, like I said, you, you, just like, as an, you wouldn't want someone into like, you wouldn't want someone in the elevator, if you're in an elevator, do you really want someone with a big lever, some, some random person operating the elevator between floors?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I wouldn't trust that or rather have the buttons."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "You're optimistic about the pace of improvement of the system that from what you've seen with the full self driving car computer, the rate of improvement is exponential."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So one of the other very interesting design choices early on that connects to this is the operational design domain of autopilot."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So where autopilot is able to be turned on the, so contrast another vehicle system that we're studying is the Cadillac SuperCrew system."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "That's in terms of ODD, very constrained to particular kinds of highways, well mapped, tested, but it's much narrower than the ODD of Tesla vehicles."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "What's there's, there's pros and..."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "It's like ADD."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "That's a, that's a good line."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Uh, what was the design decision, uh, what, in that different philosophy of thinking where there's pros and cons, what we see with, uh, a wide ODD is drive Tesla drivers are able to explore more the limitations of the system, at least early on, and they understand together with the instrument cluster display, they start to understand what are the capabilities."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "So that's a benefit."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "The con is you go, you're letting drivers use it basically anywhere."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "So anyway, that could detect lanes with confidence."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Was there a philosophy, uh, design decisions that were challenging that were being made there or from the very beginning, was that, uh, done on purpose with intent?"}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Well, I mean, I think it's frankly, it's pretty crazy giving it, letting people drive a two ton death machine manually."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Uh, that's crazy."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Like, like in the future of people who are like, I can't believe anyone was just allowed to drive for one of these two ton death machines and they just drive wherever they wanted."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Just like elevators."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "He was like, move the elevator with that lever, wherever you want."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "It can stop at halfway between floors if you want."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "It's pretty crazy."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So it's going to seem like a mad thing in the future that people were driving cars."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So I have a bunch of questions about the human psychology, about behavior and so on that would become that because, uh, you have faith in the AI system, uh, not faith, but, uh, the, both on the hardware side and the deep learning approach of learning from data will make it just far safer than humans."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Recently, there are a few hackers who, uh, tricked autopilot to act in unexpected ways with adversarial examples."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So we all know that neural network systems are very sensitive to minor disturbances to these adversarial examples on input."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Do you think it's possible to defend against something like this for the broader, for the industry?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So can you elaborate on the, on the confidence behind that answer?"}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Um, well the, you know, neural net is just like a basic bunch of matrix math."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Or you have to be like a very sophisticated, somebody who really understands neural nets and like basically reverse engineer how the matrix is being built and then create a little thing that's just exactly, um, causes the matrix math to be slightly off."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "But it's very easy to then block it, block that by, by having basically anti negative recognition."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "It's like if you, if the system sees something that looks like a matrix hack, uh, exclude it, so it's such an easy thing to do."}]}, {"title": "David Patterson: Computer Architecture and Data Storage | Lex Fridman Podcast #104", "id": "naed4C4hfAg", "quotes": [{"time": 300,

predicted."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And you could imagine it was easy to believe that Moore's law was going to continue."}, {"time": 526, "text": "And so this would be the implications."}, {"time":

HTTP."}, {"time": 553, "text": "People thought it looked like alien writing, right?"}, {"time": 553, "text": "You'd see these advertisements and commercials or bulletin boards that had this alien writing on it."}, {"time": 562, "text": "So for the lay people, it's like, what the hell is going on here?"}, {"time": 566, "text": "And for those people in the industry, it was, oh my God, this stuff is getting so popular, it's actually leaking out of our nerdy world into the real world."}, {"time": 577, "text": "So that, I mean, there was events like that."}, {"time": 577, "text": "I think another one was, I remember in the early days of the personal computer, when we started seeing advertisements in magazines for personal computers, like it's so popular that it's made the newspapers."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So at one hand, you know, Gordon Moore predicted it and you kind of expected it to happen, but when it really hit and you saw it affecting society, it was shocking."}, {"time": 596, "text": "So maybe taking a step back and looking both the engineering and philosophical perspective, what do you see as the layers of abstraction in the computer?"}, {"time": 611, "text": "Do you see a computer as a set of layers of abstractions?"}, {"time": 616, "text": "Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, I think that's one of the things that computer science fundamentals is the, these things are really complicated in the way we cope with complicated software and complicated hardware is these layers of abstraction."}, {"time": 626, "text": "And that simply means that we, you know, suspend disbelief and pretend that the only thing you know is that layer, and you don't know anything about the layer below it."}, {"time": 639, "text": "And that's the way we can make very complicated things."}, {"time": 644, "text": "And probably it started with hardware that that's the way it was done, but it's been proven extremely useful."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And, you know, I would say in a modern computer today, there might be 10 or 20 layers of abstraction, and they're all trying to kind of enforce this contract is all you know is this interface."}, {"time": 662, "text": "There's a set of commands that you can, are allowed to use, and you stick to those commands, and we will faithfully execute that."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And it's like peeling the air layers of a London, of an onion, you get down, there's a new set of layers and so forth."}, {"time": 679, "text": "So for people who want to study computer science, the exciting part about it is you can keep peeling those layers."}, {"time": 687, "text": "You take your first course, and you might learn to program in Python, and then you can take a follow on course, and you can get it down to a lower level language like C, and you know, you can go and then you can, if you want to, you can start getting into the hardware layers, and you keep getting down all the way to that transistor that I talked about that Gordon Moore predicted."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And you can understand all those layers all the way up to the highest level application software."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So it's a very kind of magnetic field."}, {"time": 713, "text": "If you're interested, you can go into any depth and keep going."}, {"time": 722, "text": "In particular, what's happening right now, or it's happened in software the last 20 years and recently in hardware, there's getting to be open source versions of all of these things."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So what open source means is what the engineer, the programmer designs, it's not secret, the belonging to a company, it's out there on the worldwide web, so you can see it."}, {"time": 746, "text": "So you can look at, for lots of pieces of software that you use, you can see exactly what the programmer does if you want to get involved."}, {"time": 753, "text": "That used to stop at the hardware."}, {"time": 759, "text": "Recently, there's been an effort to make open source hardware and those interfaces open, so you can see that."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So instead of before you had to stop at the hardware, you can now start going layer by layer below that and see what's inside there."}, {"time": 771, "text": "So it's a remarkable time that for the interested individual can really see in great depth what's really going on in the computers that power everything that we see around us."}, {"time": 781, "text": "Are you thinking also when you say open source at the hardware level, is this going to the design architecture instruction set level or is it going to literally the manufacturer of the actual hardware, of the actual chips, whether that's ASIC specialized to a particular domain or the general?"}, {"time": 804, "text": "Yeah, so let's talk about that a little bit."}, {"time": 810, "text": "So when you get down to the bottom layer of software, the way software talks to hardware is in a vocabulary."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And what we call that vocabulary, we call that, the words of that vocabulary are called instructions."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And the technical term for the vocabulary is instruction set."}, {"time": 830, "text": "So those instructions are like we talked about earlier, that can be instructions like add, subtract and multiply, divide."}, {"time": 835, "text": "There's instructions to put data into memory, which is called a store instruction and to get data back, which is called the load instructions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And those simple instructions go back to the very dawn of computing in 1950, the commercial computer had these instructions."}, {"time": 852, "text": "So that's the instruction set that we're talking about."}, {"time": 857, "text": "So up until, I'd say 10 years ago, these instruction sets were all proprietary."}, {"time": 857, "text": "So a very popular one is owned by Intel, the one that's in the cloud and in all the PCs in the world."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Intel owns that instruction set."}, {"time": 869, "text": "It's referred to as the x86."}, {"time": 869, "text": "There've been a sequence of ones that the first number was called 8086."}, {"time": 876, "text": "And since then, there's been a lot of numbers, but they all end in 86."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So there's been that kind of family of instruction sets."},

kind of powers all the cell phones in the world, all the iPads in the world, and a lot of things that are so called Internet of Things devices."}, {"time": 902, "text": "ARM and that one is also proprietary."}, {"time": 902, "text": "ARM will license it to people for a fee, but they own that."}, {"time": 909, "text": "So the new idea that got started at Berkeley kind of unintentionally 10 years ago is early in my career, we pioneered a way to do these vocabularies instruction sets that was very controversial at the time."}, {"time": 925, "text": "At the time in the 1980s, conventional wisdom was these vocabularies instruction sets should have powerful instructions."}, {"time": 932, "text": "So polysyllabic kind of words, you can think of that."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And so instead of just add, subtract, and multiply, they would have polynomial, divide, or sort a list."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And the hope was of those powerful vocabularies, that'd make it easier for software."}, {"time": 951, "text": "So we thought that didn't make sense for microprocessors."}, {"time": 951, "text": "There was people at Berkeley and Stanford and IBM who argued the opposite."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And what we called that was a reduced instruction set computer."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And the abbreviation was RISC."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And typical for computer people, we use the abbreviation start pronouncing it."}, {"time": 970, "text": "So risk was the thing."}, {"time": 970, "text": "So we said for microprocessors, which with Gordon's Moore is changing really fast, we think it's better to have a pretty simple set of instructions, reduced set of instructions."}, {"time": 981, "text": "That that would be a better way to build microprocessors since they're going to be changing so fast due to Moore's law."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And then we'll just use standard software to cover the use, generate more of those simple instructions."}, {"time": 992, "text": "And one of the pieces of software that's in that software stack going between these layers of abstractions is called a compiler."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And it's basically translates, it's a translator between levels."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "We said the translator will handle that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So the technical question was, well, since there are these reduced instructions, you have to execute more of them."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "But maybe you could execute them faster."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "They're simpler so they could go faster, but you have to do more of them."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "So what's that trade off look like?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And it ended up that we ended up executing maybe 50% more instructions, maybe a third more instructions, but they ran four times faster."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So this risk, controversial risk ideas proved to be maybe factors of three or four better."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "I love that this idea was controversial and almost kind of like rebellious."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So that's in the context of what was more conventional is the complex instructional set computing."},

"text": "And believe it or not, this sounds very, who cares about this?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It was violently debated at several conferences."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's like, what's the right way to go?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And people thought risk was a deevolution."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "We're going to make software worse by making those instructions simpler."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "And there are fierce debates at several conferences in the 1980s."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "And then later in the 80s, it kind of settled to these benefits."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "It's not completely intuitive to me why risk has, for the most part, won."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "So why did that happen?"}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And maybe I can sort of say a bunch of dumb things that could lay the land for further commentary."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So to me, this is kind of an interesting thing."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "If you look at C++ versus C, with modern compilers, you really could write faster code with C++."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So relying on the compiler to reduce your complicated code into something simple and fast."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So let's try and split that into two pieces."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So if the compiler can do that for you, if the compiler can take, you know, a complicated program and produce simpler instructions, then the programmer doesn't care, right?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "I don't care just how fast is the computer I'm using, how much does it cost?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And so what happened kind of in the software industry is right around before the 1980s, critical pieces of software were still written not in languages like C or C++, they were written in what's called assembly language, where there's this kind of humans writing exactly at the instructions at the level that a computer can understand."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So they were writing add, subtract, multiply, you know, instructions."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's very tedious."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "But the belief was to write this lowest level of software that people use, which are called operating systems, they had to be written in assembly language because these high level languages were just too inefficient."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "They were too slow, or the programs would be too big."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So that changed with a famous operating system called Unix, which is kind of the grandfather of all the operating systems today."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So Unix demonstrated that you could write something as complicated as an operating system in a language like C. So once that was true, then that meant we could hide the instruction set from the programmer."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And so that meant then it didn't really matter."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "The programmer didn't have to write lots of these simple instructions, that was up to the compiler."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So that was part of our arguments for risk is, if you were still writing assembly language, there's maybe a better case for CISC instructions."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "But if the compiler can do that, it's going to be, you know, that's done once the computer translates at once."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And then every time you run the program, it runs at this potentially simpler instructions."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And so that was the debate, right?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And people would acknowledge that the simpler instructions could lead to a faster computer."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "You can think of monosyllabic instructions, you could say them, you know, if you think of reading, you can probably read them faster or say them faster than long instructions."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "The same thing, that analogy works pretty well for hardware."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "And as long as you didn't have to read a lot more of those instructions, you could win."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "So that's kind of, that's the basic idea for risk."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "But it's interesting that in that discussion of Unix and C, that there's only one step of levels of abstraction from the code that's really the closest to the machine to the code that's written by human."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "It's, at least to me again, perhaps a dumb intuition, but it feels like there might've been more layers, sort of different kinds of humans stacked on top of each other."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So what's true and not true about what you said is several of the layers of software, like, so the, if you, two layers would be, suppose we just talked about two layers, that would be the operating system, like you get from Microsoft or from Apple, like iOS, or the Windows operating system."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And let's say applications that run on top of it, like Word or Excel."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "So both the operating system could be written in C and the application could be written in C. But you could construct those two layers and the applications absolutely do call upon the operating system."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And the change was that both of them could be written in higher level languages."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So it's one step of a translation, but you can still build many layers of abstraction of software on top of that."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And that's how things are done today."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So still today, many of the layers that you'll deal with, you may deal with debuggers, you may deal with linkers, there's libraries."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Many of those today will be written in C++, say, even though that language is pretty ancient."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And even the Python interpreter is probably written in C or C++."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "So lots of layers there are probably written in these, some old fashioned efficient languages that still take one step to produce these instructions, produce RISC instructions, but they're composed, each layer of software invokes one another through these interfaces."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And you can get 10 layers of software that way."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So in general, the RISC was developed here at Berkeley?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "It was kind of the three places that were these radicals that advocated for this against the rest of community were IBM, Berkeley, and Stanford."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "You're one of these radicals."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "And how radical did you feel?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "How confident did you feel?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "How doubtful were you that RISC might be the right approach?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Because it may, you can also intuit that is kind of taking a step back into simplicity, not forward into simplicity."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Yeah, no, it was easy to make, yeah, it was easy to make the argument against it."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Well, this was my colleague, John Hennessy at Stanford Nine."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "We were both assistant professors."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And for me, I just believed in the power of our ideas."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "I thought what we were saying made sense."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "Moore's law is going to move fast."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "The other thing that I didn't mention is one of the surprises of these complex instruction sets."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "You could certainly write these complex instructions if the programmer is writing them themselves."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "It turned out to be kind of difficult for the compiler to generate those complex instructions."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Kind of ironically, you'd have to find the right circumstances that just exactly fit this complex instruction."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "It was actually easier for the compiler to generate these simple instructions."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "So not only did these complex instructions make the hardware more difficult to build, often the compiler wouldn't even use them."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And so it's harder to build."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "The compiler doesn't use them that much."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "The simple instructions go better with Moore's law."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "The number of transistors is doubling every two years."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So we're going to have, you want to reduce the time to design the microprocessor, that may be more important than these number of instructions."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So I think we believed that we were right, that this was the best idea."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "Then the question became in these debates, well, yeah, that's a good technical idea, but in the business world, this doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "There's other things that matter."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "It's like arguing that if there's a standard with the railroad tracks and you've come up with a better width, but the whole world is covered in railroad tracks, so your ideas have no chance of success."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Commercial success."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "It was technically right, but commercially it'll be insignificant."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of sad that this world, the history of human civilization is full of good ideas that lost because somebody else came along first with a worse idea."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And it's good that in the computing world, at least some of these have, well, you could, I mean, there's probably still CISC people that say, yeah, there still are."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "And what happened was, what was interesting, Intel, a bunch of the CISC companies with CISC instruction sets of vocabulary, they gave up, but not Intel."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "What Intel did to its credit, because Intel's vocabulary was in the personal computer."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And so that was a very valuable vocabulary because the way we distribute software is in those actual instructions."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "It's in the instructions of that instruction set."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "So you don't get that source code, what the programmers wrote."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "You get, after it's been translated into the lowest level, that's if you were to get a floppy disk or download software, it's in the instructions of that instruction set."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So the x86 instruction set was very valuable."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So what Intel did cleverly and amazingly is they had their chips in hardware do a translation step."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "They would take these complex instructions and translate them into essentially in RISC instructions in hardware on the fly, at gigahertz clock speeds."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And then any good idea that RISC people had, they could use, and they could still be compatible with this really valuable PC software base, which also had very high volumes, 100 million personal computers per year."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "So the CISC architecture in the business world was actually won in this PC era."}, {"time": 1689,

it art?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Is it science?"}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Yeah, I'd say, I think designing a good instruction set is an art."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And I think you're trying to balance the simplicity and speed of execution with how well easy it will be for compilers to use it."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "You're trying to create an instruction set that everything in there can be used by compilers."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "There's not things that are missing that'll make it difficult for the program to run."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "They run efficiently, but you want it to be easy to build as well."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "So I'd say you're thinking hardware, trying to find a hardware software compromise that'll work well."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And it's a matter of taste."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "It's kind of fun to build instruction sets."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "It's not that hard to build an instruction set, but to build one that catches on and people use, you have to be fortunate to be the right place in the right time or have a design that people really like."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Are you using metrics?"}, {"time": 1783, "text": "So is it quantifiable?"}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Because you kind of have to anticipate the kind of programs that people write ahead of time."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So can you use numbers?"},

anticipating?"}, {"time": 1796, "text": "No, it's a big change."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Kind of what happened, I think from Hennessy's and my perspective in the 1980s, what happened was going from kind of really, you know, taste and hunches to quantifiable."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And in fact, he and I wrote a textbook at the end of the 1980s called Computer Architecture, A Quantitative Approach."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "I heard of that."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And it's the thing, it had a pretty big impact in the field because we went from textbooks that kind of listed, so here's what this computer does, and here's the pros and cons, and here's what this computer does and pros and cons to something where there were formulas and equations where you could measure things."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So specifically for instruction sets, what we do and some other fields do is we agree upon a set of programs, which we call benchmarks, and a suite of programs, and then you develop both the hardware and the compiler and you get numbers on how well your computer does given its instruction set and how well you implemented it in your microprocessor and how good your compilers are."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "In computer architecture, you know, using professor's terms, we grade on a curve rather than grade on an absolute scale."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "So when you say, you know, these programs run this fast, well, that's kind of interesting, but how do you know it's better?"}, {"time": 1884, "text": "Well, you compare it to other computers at the same time."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So the best way we know how to turn it into a kind of more science and experimental and quantitative is to compare yourself to other computers of the same era that have the same access to the same kind of technology on commonly agreed benchmark programs."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "So maybe to toss up two possible directions we can go."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "One is what are the different tradeoffs in designing architectures?"}, {"time": 1911, "text": "We've been already talking about SISC and RISC, but maybe a little bit more detail in terms of specific features that you were thinking about."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "And the other side is what are the metrics that you're thinking about when looking at these tradeoffs?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Yeah, let's talk about the metrics."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "So during these debates, we actually had kind of a hard time explaining, convincing people the ideas, and partly we didn't have a formula to explain it."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And a few years into it, we hit upon a formula that helped explain what was going on."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And I think if we can do this, see how it works orally to do this."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "So if I can do a formula orally, let's see."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So fundamentally, the way you measure performance is how long does it take a program to run?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "A program, if you have 10 programs, and typically these benchmarks were sweet because you'd want to have 10 programs so they could represent lots of different applications."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "So for these 10 programs, how long does it take to run?"}, {"time": 1971, "text": "Well now, when you're trying to explain why it took so long, you could factor how long it takes a program to run into three factors."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "One of the first one is how many instructions did it take to execute?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So that's the what we've been talking about, you know, the instructions of Alchemy."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "How many did it take?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "The next question is how long did each instruction take to run on average?"}, {"time": 1991, "text": "So you multiply the number of instructions times how long it took to run, and that gets you time."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "Okay, so that's, but now let's look at this metric of how long did it take the instruction to run."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "Well, it turns out, the way we could build computers today is they all have a clock, and you've seen this when you, if you buy a microprocessor, it'll say 3.1 gigahertz or 2.5 gigahertz, and more gigahertz is good."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "Well, what that is is the speed of the clock."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "So 2.5 gigahertz turns out to be 4 billionths of instruction or 4 nanoseconds."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So that's the clock cycle time."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "But there's another factor, which is what's the average number of clock cycles it takes per instruction?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "So it's number of instructions, average number of clock cycles, and the clock cycle time."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "So in these risk sis debates, they would concentrate on, but risk needs to take more instructions, and we'd argue maybe the clock cycle is faster, but what the real big difference was was the number of clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "Per instruction, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "What about the mess of, the beautiful mess of parallelism in the whole picture?"}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Parallelism, which has to do with, say, how many instructions could execute in parallel and things like that, you could think of that as affecting the clock cycles per instruction, because it's the average clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So when you're running a program, if it took 100 billion instructions, and on average it took two clock cycles per instruction, and they were four nanoseconds, you could multiply that out and see how long it took to run."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And there's all kinds of tricks to try and reduce the number of clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "But it turned out that the way they would do these complex instructions is they would actually build what we would call an interpreter in a simpler, a very simple hardware interpreter."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "But it turned out that for the sis constructions, if you had to use one of those interpreters, it would be like 10 clock cycles per instruction, where the risk constructions could be two."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So there'd be this factor of five advantage in clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "We have to execute, say, 25 or 50 percent more instructions, so that's where the win would come."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "And then you could make an argument whether the clock cycle times are the same or not."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "But pointing out that we could divide the benchmark results time per program into three factors, and the biggest difference between RISC and SIS was the clock cycles per, you execute a few more instructions, but the clock cycles per instruction is much less."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And that was what this debate, once we made that argument, then people said, oh, okay, I get it."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "And so we went from, it was outrageously controversial in, you know, 1982 that maybe probably by 1984 or so, people said, oh, yeah, technically, they've got a good argument."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "What are the instructions in the RISC instruction set, just to get an intuition?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "1995, I was asked to predict the future of what microprocessor could future."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "So I, and I'd seen these predictions and usually people predict something outrageous just to be entertaining, right?"}, {"time": 2180, "text": "And so my prediction for 2020 was, you know, things are going to be pretty much, they're going to look very familiar to what they are."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "And they are, and if you were to read the article, you know, the things I said are pretty much true."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "The instructions that have been around forever are kind of the same."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And that's the outrageous prediction, actually."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Given how fast computers have been going."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Well, and you know, Moore's law was going to go on, we thought for 25 more years, you know, who knows, but kind of the surprising thing, in fact, you know, Hennessy and I, you know, won the ACM, AM, Turing award for both the RISC instruction set contributions and for that textbook I mentioned."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "But, you know, we're surprised that here we are 35, 40 years later after we did our work and the conventionalism of the best way to do instruction sets is still those RISC instruction sets that looked very similar to what we looked like, you know, we did in the 1980s."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "So those, surprisingly, there hasn't been some radical new idea, even though we have, you know, a million times as many transistors as we had back then."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But what are the basic constructions and how do they change over the years?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So we're talking about addition, subtraction, these are the specific."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So the things that are in a calculator are in a computer."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So any of the buttons that are in the calculator in the computer, so the, so if there's a memory function key, and like I said, those are, turns into putting something in memory is called a store, bring something back to load."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "Just a quick tangent."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "When you say memory, what does memory mean?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "Well, I told you there were five pieces of a computer."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And if you remember in a calculator, there's a memory key."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "So you want to have intermediate calculation and bring it back later."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "So you'd hit the memory plus key M plus maybe, and it would put that into memory and then you'd hit an RM like recurrence section and then bring it back on the display."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "So you don't have to type it."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "You don't have to write it down and bring it back again."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So that's exactly what memory is."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "You can put things into it as temporary storage and bring it back when you need it later."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So that's memory and loads and stores."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "But the big thing, the difference between a computer and a calculator is that the computer can make decisions."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And amazingly, decisions are as simple as, is this value less than zero?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Or is this value bigger than that value?"}, {"time": 2321, "text": "And those instructions, which are called conditional branch instructions, is what give computers all its power."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "If you were in the early days of computing before what's called the general purpose microprocessor, people would write these instructions kind of in hardware, but it couldn't make decisions."},

automatically."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And it can make these decisions billions of times per second."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And amazingly enough, we can get, thanks to advanced machine learning, we can create programs that can do something smarter than human beings can do."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "But if you go down that very basic level, it's the instructions are the keys on the calculator, plus the ability to make decisions, these conditional branch instructions."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And all decisions fundamentally can be reduced down to these branch instructions."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So in fact, and so going way back in the stack back to, we did four RISC projects at Berkeley in the 1980s."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "They did a couple at Stanford in the 1980s."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "In 2010, we decided we wanted to do a new instruction set learning from the mistakes of those RISC architectures in the 1980s."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "And that was

called it RISC 5 to honor those RISC, the four RISC projects of the 1980s."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "So what does RISC 5 involve?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "So RISC 5 is another instruction set of vocabulary."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "It's learned from the mistakes of the past, but it still has, if you look at the, there's a core set of instructions that's very similar to the simplest architectures from the 1980s."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "And the big difference about RISC 5 is it's open."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "So I talked early about proprietary versus open software."},

in the scientific American, if you were to predict 10, 20, 30 years from now, that kind of ability to utilize open source instruction set architectures like RISC 5, what kind of possibilities might that unlock?"}, {"time": 2473, "text": "And so just to make it clear, because this is confusing, the specification of RISC 5 is something that's like in a textbook, there's books about it."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "So that's defining an interface."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "There's also the way you build hardware is you write it in languages that are kind of like C, but they're specialized for hardware that gets translated into hardware."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And so these implementations of this specification are the open source."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "So they're written in something that's called Verilog or VHDL, but it's put up on the web, just like you can see the C++ code for Linux on the web."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So that's the open instruction set enables open

"text": "So what happened to us that the story was this was developed here for our use to do our research."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And we made it, we licensed under the Berkeley Software Distribution License, like a lot of things get licensed here."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So other academics use it, they wouldn't be afraid to use it."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And then about 2014, we started getting complaints that we were using it in our research and in our courses."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And we got complaints from people in industries, why did you change your instruction

instruction set?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And then when we talked to him, we found out there was this thirst for this idea of an open instruction set architecture."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And they had been looking for one."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "They stumbled upon ours at Berkeley, thought it was, boy, this looks great."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "We should use this one."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And so once we realized there is this need for an open instruction set architecture, we thought that's a great idea."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "And then we started supporting it and tried to make it happen."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So this was kind of, we accidentally stumbled into this and to this need and our timing was good."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And so it's really taking off."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "There's, you know, universities are good at starting things, but they're not good at sustaining things."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So like Linux has a Linux foundation, there's a RISC 5 foundation that we started."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "There's an annual conferences."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And the first one was done, I think, January of 2015."},

and the companies excited all over the world."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "So if predicting into the future, you know, if we were doing 25 years, I would predict that RISC 5 will be, you know, possibly the most popular instruction set architecture out there, because it's a pretty good instruction set architecture and it's open and free."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "And there's no reason lots of people shouldn't use it."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And there's benefits just like Linux is so popular today compared to 20 years ago."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And, you know, the fact that you can get access to it for free, you can modify it, you can improve it for all those same arguments."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so people collaborate to make it a better system for everybody to use."},

you look at just the lay of the land, and what do you think, just for me, because I'm not familiar how difficult this kind of transition would, how much challenges this kind of transition would

you point out, there's these very popular proprietary instruction sets, the x86."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "And so how do we move to RISC 5 potentially in sort of in the span of 5, 10, 20 years, a kind of unification, given that the devices, the kind of way we use devices, IoT, mobile devices, and the cloud keeps changing?"}, {"time": 2720, "text": "Well, part of it, a big piece of it is the software stack."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "And right now, looking forward, there seem to be three important markets."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "There's the cloud."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And the cloud is simply companies like Alibaba and Amazon and Google, Microsoft, having these giant data centers with tens of thousands of servers in maybe a hundred of these data centers all over the world."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And that's what the cloud is."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "So the computer that dominates the cloud is the x86 instruction set."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "So the instruction sets used in the cloud are the x86, almost 100% of that today is x86."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "The other big thing are cell phones and laptops."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "Those are the big things today."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "I mean, the PC is also dominated by the x86 instruction set, but those sales are dwindling."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "You know, there's maybe 200 million PCs a year, and there's one and a half billion phones a year."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "There's numbers like that."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "So for the phones, that's dominated by ARM."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And now, and a reason that I talked about the software stacks, and the third category is Internet of Things, which is basically embedded devices, things in your cars and your microwaves everywhere."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "So what's different about those three categories is for the cloud, the software that runs in the cloud is determined by these companies, Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "So they control that software stack."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "For the cell phones, there's both for Android and Apple, the software they supply, but both of them have marketplaces where anybody in the world can build software."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And that software is translated or, you know, compiled down and shipped in the vocabulary of ARM."},

2841, "text": "And sorry, just a quick interruption."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So ARM, what is ARM?"}, {"time": 2841, "text": "ARM is an instruction set, like a risk based... Yeah, it's a risk based instruction set."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "It's a proprietary one."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "ARM stands for Advanced Risk Machine."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "ARM is the name where the company is."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "So it's a proprietary risk architecture."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "So, and it's been around for a while and it's, you know, the, surely the most popular instruction set in the world right now."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "They, every year, billions of chips are using the ARM design in this post PC era."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "Was it one of the early risk adopters of the risk idea?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "The first ARM goes back, I don't know, 86 or so."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So Berkeley instead did their work in the early 80s."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "The ARM guys needed an instruction set and they read our papers and it heavily influenced them."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "So getting back to my story, what about Internet of Things?"}, {"time": 2897, "text": "Well, software is not shipped in Internet of Things."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "It's the embedded device people control that software stack."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "So the opportunities for risk five, everybody thinks, is in the Internet of Things embedded things because there's no dominant player like there is in the cloud or the smartphones."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "And, you know, it's, it's, doesn't have a lot of licenses associated with, and you can enhance the instruction set if you want."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "And it's, and people have looked at instruction sets and think it's a very good instruction set."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "So it appears to be very popular there."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "It's possible that in the cloud people, those companies control their software stacks."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So it's possible that they would decide to use risk five if we're talking about 10 and 20 years in the future."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "The one that would be harder would be the cell phones."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "Since people ship software in the ARM instruction set that you'd think be the more difficult one."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "But if risk five really catches on and, you know, you could, in a period of a decade, you can imagine that's changing over too."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "Do you have a sense why risk five or ARM has dominated?"}, {"time": 2965, "text": "You mentioned these three categories."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "Why has, why did ARM dominate, why does it dominate the mobile device space?"}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And maybe my naive intuition is that there are some aspects of power efficiency that are important that somehow come along with risk."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "Well, part of it is for these old CIS construction sets, like in the x86, it was more expensive to these for, you know, they're older, so they have disadvantages in them because they were designed 40 years ago."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "But also they have to translate in hardware from CIS constructions to risk constructions on the fly."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "And that costs both silicon area that the chips are bigger to be able to do that."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And it uses more power."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So ARM has, which has, you know, followed this risk philosophy is seen to be much more energy efficient."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "And in today's computer world, both in the cloud and the cell phone and, you know, things, it isn't, the limiting resource isn't the number of transistors you can fit in the chip."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "It's what, how much power can you dissipate for your application?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So by having a reduced instruction set, that's possible to have a simpler hardware, which is more energy efficient."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "And energy efficiency is incredibly important in the cloud."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "When you have tens of thousands of computers in a data center, you want to have the most energy efficient ones there as well."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And of course, for embedded things running off of batteries, you want those to be energy efficient and the cell phones too."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "So I think it's believed that there's a energy disadvantage of using these more complex instruction set architectures."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So the other aspect of this is if we look at Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, all use the ARM architecture, and yet the performance of the systems varies."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I mean, I don't know whose opinion you take on, but you know, Apple for some reason seems to perform better in terms of these implementation, these architectures."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So where's the magic and show the picture."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "How's that happen?"}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So what ARM pioneered was a new business model."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "As they said, well, here's our proprietary instruction set, and we'll give you two ways to do it."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "We'll give you one of these implementations written in things like C called Verilog, and you can just use ours."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Well, you have to pay money for that."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Not only you pay, we'll give you their, you know, we'll license you to do that, or you could design your own."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And so we're talking about numbers like tens of millions of dollars to have the right to design your own, since they, it's the instruction set belongs to them."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "So Apple got one of those, the right to build their own."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Most of the other people who build like Android phones just get one of the designs from ARM to do it themselves."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "So Apple developed a really good microprocessor design team."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "They, you know, acquired a very good team that had, was building other microprocessors and brought them into the company to build their designs."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "So the instruction sets are the same, the specifications are the same, but their hardware design is much more efficient than I think everybody else's."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And that's given Apple an advantage in the marketplace in that the iPhones tend to be the faster than most everybody else's phones that are there."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "It'd be nice to be able to jump around and kind of explore different little sides of this, but let me ask one sort of romanticized question."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "What to you is the most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set or instruction sets or this work that you've done?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "You know, I'm, you know, I was always attracted to the idea of, you know, small is beautiful, right?"}, {"time": 3200, "text": "Is that the temptation in engineering, it's kind of easy to make things more complicated."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "It's harder to come up with a, it's more difficult, surprisingly, to come up with a simple, elegant solution."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "And I think that there's a bunch of small features of RISC in general that, you know, where you can see this examples of keeping it simpler makes it more elegant."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "And then they provide optional features that could accelerate the performance instructions that if you needed them could be very helpful, but you don't need to have them."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "And that's a new, really a new idea."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So RISC 5 has right now maybe five optional subsets that you can pull in, but the software runs without them."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "If you just want to build the, just the core 40 instructions, that's fine."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "So this is fantastic educationally is you can explain computers."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "You only have to explain 40 instructions and not thousands of them."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "Also, if you invent some wild and crazy new technology like, you know, biological computing, you'd like a nice, simple instruction set and you can, RISC 5, if you implement those core instructions, you can run, you know, really interesting programs on top of that."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So this idea of a core set of instructions that the software stack runs on and then optional features that if you turn them on, the compilers were used, but you don't have to, I think is a powerful idea."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "What's happened in the past for the proprietary instruction sets is when they add new instructions, it becomes required piece."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "And so that all microprocessors in the future have to use those instructions."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So it's kind of like, for a lot of people as they get older, they gain weight, right?"}, {"time": 3333, "text": "That weight and age are correlated."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And so you can see these instruction sets getting bigger and bigger as they get older."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "So RISC 5, you know, lets you be as slim as you as a teenager."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And you only have to add these extra features if you're really going to use them rather than you have no choice."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "You have to keep growing with the instruction set."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "I don't know if the analogy holds up, but that's a beautiful notion that there's, it's almost like a nudge towards here's the simple

the instruction set architectures, they'd understand it."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "They'd say, wow, that doesn't look that different."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Well, you know, I'm surprised."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "And it's, there's, it may be something, you know, to talk about philosophical things."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "I mean, there may be something powerful about those, you know, 40 or 50 instructions that all you need is these commands like these instructions that we talked about."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "And that is sufficient to build, to bring up on, you know, artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And so it's a remarkable, surprising to me that as complicated as it is to build these things, you know, microprocessors where the line widths are are narrower than the wavelength of light, you know, is this amazing technologies at some fundamental level."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "The commands that software executes are really pretty straightforward and haven't changed that much in decades."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "What a surprising outcome."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "So underlying all computation, all Turing machines, all artificial intelligence systems, perhaps might be a very simple instruction set like a RISC5 or it's."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "I mean, that's kind of what I said."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "I was interested to see, I had another more senior faculty colleague and he had written something in Scientific American and, you know, his 25 years in the future and his turned out about when I was a young professor and he said, yep, I checked it."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And so I was interested to see how that was going to turn out for me."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And it's pretty held up pretty well, but yeah, so there's, there's probably, there's some, you know, there's, there must be something fundamental about those instructions that we're capable of creating, you know, intelligence from pretty primitive operations and just doing them really fast."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "You kind of mentioned a different, maybe radical computational medium like biological, and there's other ideas."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So there's a lot of spaces in ASIC, domain specific, and then there could be quantum computers."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "And so we can think of all of those different mediums and types of computation."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "What's the connection between swapping out different hardware systems and the instruction set?"}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Do you see those as disjoint or are they fundamentally coupled?"}, {"time": 3513, "text": "So what's, so kind of, if we go back to the history, you know, when Moore's Law is in full effect and you're getting twice as many transistors every couple of years, you know, kind of the challenge for computer designers is how can we take advantage of that?"}, {"time": 3531, "text": "How can we turn those transistors into better computers faster typically?"}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And so there was an era, I guess in the 80s and 90s where computers were doubling performance every 18 months."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And if you weren't around then, what would happen is you had your computer and your friend's computer, which was like a year, a year and a half newer, and it was much faster than your computer."}, {"time": 3558,

them away to buy a newer computer because the computer one or two years later was so much faster."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "So that's what the world was like in the 80s and 90s."}, {"time": 3579,

just, they were just so sluggish compared to the latest computers."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "So that's, you know, that's a huge change of what's gone on."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "So, but since this lasted for decades, kind of programmers and maybe all of society is used to computers getting faster regularly."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "We now believe, those of us who are in computer design, it's called computer architecture, that the path forward is instead is to add accelerators that only work well for certain applications."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So since Moore's Law is slowing down, we don't think general purpose computers are going to get a lot faster."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "So the Intel processors of the world are not going to, haven't been getting a lot faster."}, {"time":

accelerators to their microprocessors that only work well for some domains."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And by sheer coincidence, at the same time that this is happening, has been this revolution in artificial intelligence called machine learning."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So with, as I'm sure your other guests have said, you know, AI had these two competing schools of thought is that we could figure out artificial intelligence by just writing the rules top down, or that was wrong."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "You had to look at data and infer what the rules are, the machine learning, and what's happened in the last decade or eight years as machine learning has won."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And it turns out that machine learning, the hardware you build for machine learning is pretty much multiply."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "The matrix multiply is a key feature for the way machine learning is done."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "So that's a godsend for computer designers."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "We know how to make matrix multiply run really fast."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "So general purpose microprocessors are slowing down."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "We're adding accelerators for machine learning that fundamentally are doing matrix multiplies much more efficiently than general purpose computers have done."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "So we have to come up with a new way to accelerate things."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "The danger of only accelerating one application is how important is that application."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "Turns out machine learning gets used for all kinds of things."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "So serendipitously, we found something to accelerate that's widely applicable."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And we don't even, we're in the middle of this revolution of machine learning."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "We're not sure what the limits of machine learning are."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "So this has been a kind of a godsend."}, {"time": 3760,

performance even as Moore's law is slowing down."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "And counterintuitively, the machine learning mechanism you can say is domain specific, but because it's leveraging data, it's actually could be very broad in terms of in terms of the domains it could be applied in."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "Sort of, it's almost sort of people sometimes talk about the idea of software 2.0."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "We're almost taking another step up in the abstraction layer in designing machine learning systems, because now you're programming in the space of data, in the space of hyperparameters, it's changing fundamentally the nature of programming."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And so the specialized devices that accelerate the performance, especially neural network based machine learning systems might become the new general."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "So the thing that's interesting point out these are not coral, these are not tied together."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "The enthusiasm about machine learning about creating programs driven from data that we should figure out the answers from data rather than kind of top down, which classically the way most programming is done and the way artificial intelligence used to be done."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "That's a movement that's going on at the same time."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "Coincidentally, and the first word machine learning is machines, right?"}, {"time": 3854, "text": "So that's going to increase the demand for computing, because instead of programmers being smart, writing those those things down, we're going to instead use computers to examine a lot of data to kind of create the programs."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "And remarkably, this gets used for all kinds of things very successfully."},

down right when we need a lot more cycles."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "It's failing us, it's failing us right when we need it because there's going to be a greater increase in computing."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "And then this idea that we're going to do so called domain specific."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "Here's a domain that your greatest fear is you'll make this one thing work and that'll help, you know, five percent of the people in the world."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "Well, this looks like it's a very general purpose thing."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "So the timing is fortuitous that if we can perhaps, if we can keep building hardware that will accelerate machine learning, the neural networks, that'll beat the timing will be right."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "That neural network revolution will transform your software, the so called software 2.0."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "And the software of the future will be very different from the software of the past."}, {"time": 3942,

can accelerate the kind of the small piece that's computationally intensive."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "It's not lots of lines of code, but it takes a lot of cycles to run that code that that's going to be the accelerator piece."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "And so that's what makes this from a computer designers perspective a really interesting decade."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "What Hennessy and I talked about in the title of our Turing Warrant speech is a new golden age."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "We see this as a very exciting decade, much like when we were assistant professors and the RISC

software hardware."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "It was the compilers improving as well as the architecture improving."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "And that's likely to be the way things are now."},

PyTorch and TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "So where the most optimization might be happening."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "And so there'll be both the compiler piece and the hardware piece underneath it."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "So as you kind of the fatal flaw for hardware people is to create really great hardware, but not have brought along the compilers."}, {"time": 4073, "text":

benchmarks."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "And we've created something called ML Perf, which is machine learning benchmark suite."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "And pretty much the companies who didn't invest in the software stack couldn't run ML Perf very well."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And the ones who did invest in software stack did."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And we're seeing, you know, like kind of in computer architecture, this is what happens."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "You have these arguments about risk versus this."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "People spend billions of dollars in the marketplace to see who wins."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "It's not a perfect comparison, but it kind of sorts things out."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "And we're seeing companies go out of business and

some interesting aspects of that portfolio of metrics?"}, {"time": 4188, "text": "Well, one of the interesting metrics is what we thought."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "I was involved in the start."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Peter Mattson is leading the effort from Google."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Google got it off the ground, but we had to reach out to competitors and say, there's no benchmarks here."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "We think this is bad for the field."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "It'll be much better if we look at examples like in the risk days, there was an effort to create a... For the people in the risk community got together, competitors got together building risk microprocessors to agree on a set of benchmarks that were called spec."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And that was good for the industry."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "It's rather before the different risk architectures were arguing, well, you can believe my performance others, but those other guys are liars."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "And that didn't do any good."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "So we agreed on a set of benchmarks and then we could figure out who was faster between the various risk architectures."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "But it was a little bit faster, but that grew the market rather than people were afraid to buy anything."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "So we argued the same thing would happen with MLPerf."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Companies like Nvidia were maybe worried that it was some kind of trap, but eventually we all got together to create a set of benchmarks and do the right thing."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And we agree on the results."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And so we can see whether TPUs or GPUs or CPUs are really faster and how much the faster."},

at another institution, boy, they did a better job than us."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "What you hate is if it's false, right?"}, {"time": 4278, "text": "They're making claims and it's just marketing bullshit and that's affecting sales."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "So from an engineer's perspective, as long as it's a fair comparison and we don't come in first place, that's too bad, but it's fair."},

things that I enjoy about the internet has a few downsides, but one of the nice things is people can see through BS a little better with the presence of these kinds of metrics."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "So it's really nice companies like Google and Facebook and Twitter."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "Now, it's the cool thing to do is to put your engineers forward and to actually show off how well you do on these metrics."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "There's less of a desire to do marketing, less so."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "In my sort of naive viewpoint."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "I was trying to understand what's changed from the 80s in this era."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "I think because of things like social networking, Twitter and stuff like that, if you put up bullshit stuff that's just purposely misleading, you can get a violent reaction in social media pointing out the flaws in your arguments."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And so from a marketing perspective, you have to be careful today that you didn't have to be careful that there'll be people who put out the flaw."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "You can get the word out about the flaws in what you're saying much more easily today than in the past."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "It used to be easier to get away with it."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "And the other thing that's been happening in terms of showing off engineers is just in the software side, people have largely embraced open source software."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "20 years ago, it was a dirty word at Microsoft."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "And today Microsoft is one of the big proponents of open source software."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "LR But that's, of course, not everywhere."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Like in the space that I work more in is autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And there's still the machinery of hype and marketing is still very strong there."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And there's less willingness to be open in this kind of open source way and sort of benchmark."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "So MLPerf represents the machine learning world is much better being open source about holding itself to standards of different, the amount of incredible benchmarks in terms of the different computer vision, natural language processing tasks is incredible."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "LR Historically, it wasn't always that way."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "I had a graduate student working with me, David Martin."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So in computer, in some fields, benchmarking has been around forever."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "So computer architecture, databases, maybe operating systems, benchmarks are the way you measure progress."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "But he was working with me and then started working with Jitendra Malik."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "And Jitendra Malik in computer vision space, I guess you've interviewed Jitendra."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "And David Martin told me, they don't have benchmarks."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "Everybody has their own vision algorithm and the way, here's my image, look at how well I do."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "And everybody had their own image."}, {"time": 4504, "text": "So David Martin, back when he did his dissertation, figured out a way to do benchmarks."}, {"time": 4504, "text": "He had a bunch of graduate students identify images and then ran benchmarks to see which algorithms run well."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "And that was, as far as I know, kind of the first time people did benchmarks in computer vision, which was predated all the things that eventually led to ImageNet and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "But then the vision community got religion."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "And then once we got as far as ImageNet, then that let the guys in Toronto be able to win the ImageNet competition."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "And then that changed the whole world."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "It's a scary step actually, because when you enter the world of benchmarks, you actually have to be good to participate as opposed to...

don't have benchmarks, I mean, how do you know?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Your intuition is kind of like the way we did just do computer architecture."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "Your intuition is

quantitative to make progress."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "And so I just don't know how, you know, in fields that don't have benchmarks, I don't understand how they figure out how they're making

by the Computing Consortium, where they did a frank assessment of quantum computing."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "And both of those reports said, you know, as far as we can tell, before you get error

to address the reliability."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "So we did it originally performance, but we had to do reliability."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "So the name redundant array of inexpensive disks is

the smaller disk drives because that's where the PCs were."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "So we thought that was a technological trend that the volume of disk drives was going to be getting smaller and

look at those 30 years, just from your perspective, are there interesting developments in the space of storage that have happened in that time?"}, {"time": 5628, "text": "The big thing that happened, well, a couple of things that happened, what we did had a modest amount of storage."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So as redundancy, as people built bigger and bigger storage systems, they've added more redundancy so they could add more failures."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "And the biggest thing that happened in storage is for decades, it was based on things physically spinning called hard disk drives where you used to turn on your computer and it would make a noise."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "What that noise was, was the disk drives spinning and they were rotating at like 60 revolutions per second."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "And it's like, if you remember the vinyl records, if you've ever seen those, that's what it looked like."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "And there was like a needle like on a vinyl record that was reading it."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So the big drive change is switching that over to a semiconductor technology called flash."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "So within the last, I'd say about decade is increasing fraction of all the computers in the world are using semiconductor for storage, the flash drive, instead of being magnetic, they're optical, well, they're a semiconductor writing of information very densely."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "And that's been a huge difference."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "So all the cell phones in the world use flash."}, {"time":

yes, so RAID ideas are still very popular, even with the switch of the technology."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "Although flash drives are more reliable, if you're not doing anything like backing it up

college student, you know there's this kind of tenure system in doing research."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "So kind of this model that is popular in America, I think America really made it happen, is we can attract these really great faculty to research universities because they get to do research as well as teach."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And that, especially in fast moving fields, this means

while you're watching his lectures or while he reading his lectures, everything makes such perfect sense."}, {"time": 855, "text": "So as an entertainment session, it's wonderful because it gives you this, um, this intellectual satisfaction that you don't get from anywhere else that you like finally understand it."}, {"time": 866, "text": "But the Feynman effect is that you can't really recall what it is that gave you that insight, you know, even a week later."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And this is, um, this is true of a lot of books and a lot of lectures where the retention is never quite

some value in that interactive element?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "Yeah, well, so what's interesting is you're saying that, and the videos are non interactive in the sense that there's a play button and a pause button."}, {"time": 970, "text": "Um, and you could ask like, Hey, while you're programming these things, why don't you program it into an interactable version?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "You know, make it a Jupiter notebook that people can play with, which I should do."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And that like would be better."}, {"time": 980, "text": "I think the thing about interactives though is most people consuming them, um, just sort of consume what the author had in mind."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Uh, and that's kind of what they want."}, {"time": 989, "text": "Like I have a ton of friends who make interactive explanations."}, {"time": 993, "text": "And when you look into the analytics of how people use them, there's a small sliver that genuinely use it as a playground to have experiments."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And maybe that small sliver is actually who you're targeting and the rest don't matter."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Um, but most people consume it just as a piece of, um, like well constructed literature that maybe you tweak with the example a little bit to see what it's getting at."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "But in that way, I do think like a video can get most of the benefits of the interactive, like the interactive app, as long as you make the interactive for yourself and you decide what the best narrative to spin is."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Um, as a more concrete example, like my process with, I made this video about, um, SIR models for epidemics and it's like this agent based bottling thing where you tweak some things about how the epidemic spreads and you want to see how that affects its evolution."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "Um, my, my, uh, format for making that was very different than others where rather than scripting it ahead of time, I just made the playground and then I played a bunch, uh, and then I saw what stories there were to tell within that."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Um, that's cool."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So your, your video had that kind of structure, it had, uh, like five or six stories or whatever it was."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And like, it was basically, okay, here's a simulation, here's a model."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "What can we discover with this model?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "And here's five things I found after playing with it."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Well, cause here, the thing is a way that you could do that project is you make the model and then you put it out and you say, here's a thing for the world to play with, like come to my website where you interact with this thing."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Um, and, and people did like sort of remake it in a, um, JavaScript way so that you can go to that website and you can test your own hypotheses."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But I think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technology, but to give the story around it as well."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And like, that's kind of my job."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "It's not just to like make the, uh, the visuals that someone will look at it's to be the one to decide what's the interesting thing to walk through here."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Um, and even though there's lots of other interesting paths that one could take, that can be kind of daunting when you're just sitting there in a sandbox and you're given this tool with like five different sliders and you're told to like play and discover things."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Where do you do?"}, {"time": 1113, "text": "What do you start?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "What are my hypotheses?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "What should I be asking?"}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Like a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparks curiosity to make someone want to, um, imagine more about it."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "A few videos I've seen you do, I don't know how often you do it, but there's almost a tangential like pause where you, here's a cool thing you say like, here's a cool thing, but it's outside the scope of this video essentially, but I'll leave it to you as homework essentially to like figure out it's a cool thing to explore."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I wish I could say that wasn't a function of laziness and that's like, you've worked so hard on making the 20 minutes already that to extend it out even further, it would take more time."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And one of your cooler videos, the homomorphic, like from the Mobius strip to this, yeah, that's the super and you're like, yeah, you can't, uh, you can't transform the Mobius strip into a, into a surface without it intersecting itself, but I'll leave it to you to see why that is."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Well, I hope that's not exactly how I phrase it because I think what my hope would be is that I leave it to you to think about why you would expect that to be true and then to want to know what aspects of a Mobius strip do you want to formalize such that you can prove that intuition that you have because at some point now you're starting to invent algebraic topology."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "If you have these vague

that without crossing itself, but that feels really vague."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "How do I formalize it?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And as you're starting to formalize that, that's what's going to get you to try to come up with a definition for what it means to be orientable or non orientable."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And like once you have that motivation, a lot of the otherwise arbitrary things that are sitting at the very beginning of a topology stack textbook start to make a little more sense."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And I mean that, that whole video beautifully was a motivation for topology school."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "That was my, well, my hope with that is I feel like topology is, um, I don't want to say it's taught wrong, but I do think sometimes it's popularized in the wrong way where, uh, you know, you'll hear these things that people saying, Oh, topologists, they're very interested in surfaces that you can bend and stretch, but you can't cut or glue."},

of clay are by add some arbitrary rules about what, when I can't cut it and when I can't glue it instead, it's, there's a ton of pieces of math that, um, can actually be equivalent to, uh, like these very general structures that's like geometry, except you don't have exact distances."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "You just want to maintain a notion of closeness."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And once you

about the are not value and what that represents and what it can imply."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Um, so are not is if you are infectious and you're in a population which is completely susceptible, uh, what's the average number of people that you're going to infect during your infectiousness?"}, {"time": 1546, "text": "Um, so certainly during the beginning of an epidemic, this basically gives

back."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "It's, it's the same criticism if there's any of science is the lessons of science make us like see the world in a slightly narrow sense to where we, we have an over

that from a number of people, uh, so it's, and, and almost all of them are like techies in some capacity, probably just cause I like live in the Bay area, but, but for sure they, they're cognizant of

days, you've only covered half of it."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "I mean, that's the reason you heard a pause for me."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Um, I literally thought that can't be right."}, {"time":

you have this proportional growth property?"}, {"time": 2104, "text": "Um, because then you can also recognize when it breaks down, like in an epidemic, as you approach saturation, that would break down."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "Um, as you do anything that, uh, skews what that proportionality constant is, um, you can make it maybe not break down as being an exponential, but it can seriously

of like what you would call like S curves, which is like, it's constantly like breakthrough innovations nonstop."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Like it might not actually be an example of exponentials because of something which grows in proportion to itself."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "But instead it's almost like a benchmark that was set out that everyone's been pressured to meet."}, {"time": 2189,

whether offline about just, it's not there."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "Like what other people think, how, how, um, even like what the rest of the day looks like is just deeply in the moment, uh, or

out content is too slow to be actively helpful."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "Let me just do some biweekly lectures that if you're looking for a place to point your students, if you're a student looking for a place to be edified about math, just tune in at these times."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "Um, and in that sense, I think it was, you know, a success for those who followed with it."}, {"time":

more things like that in the future, kind of tighten that feedback loop even more."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Um, I think for, you know, you asked about like if this can be relevant to educators, like 100% online teaching is basically a form of live streaming now."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "Um, and usually it happens through zoom."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "I think if teachers view what they're doing as a kind of performance and a kind of live stream performance, um, that would probably be pretty healthy because zoom can be kind of awkward."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Um, and I brought up this little blog post actually just on like just what our setup looked like if you want to adopt it yourself and how to integrate, um, like the broadcasting software OBS with zoom or things like that."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "It was really sorry to pause on that."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "I mean, yeah, maybe we could look at the blog post, but it looked really nice."}, {"time": 4365,

show me the routes."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "One of the things that I realized is that you could, as a teacher, like it doesn't take that much to make things look and feel pretty professional."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "Um, like one component of it is as soon as you hook things up with the broadcasting software, rather than just doing like screen sharing, you can set up different scenes and then you can like have keyboard shortcuts to transition between those scenes."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "So you don't need a production studio with a director calling like, go to camera three, go to camera two, like onto the screen capture."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "Instead you can have control of that."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "And it took a little bit of practice and I would mess it up now and then, but I think I had it decently smooth such that, you know, I'm talking to the camera and then we're doing something on the paper."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "Then we're doing like a, um, playing with a Desmos graph or something."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "And something that I think in the past would have required a production team, you can actually do as a solo operation, um, and in particular as a teacher."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And I think it's worth it to try to do that because, uh, two reasons, one, you might get more engagement from the students, but the biggest reason I think one of the like best things that can come out of this pandemic education wise is if we turn a bunch of teachers into content creators."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "And if we take lessons that are usually done in these one off settings and like start to get in the habit of, um, sometimes I'll use the phrase commoditizing explanation where what you want is whatever a thing a student wants to learn."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "It just seems inefficient to me that that lesson is taught millions of times over in parallel across many different classrooms in the world."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "Like year to year, you've got a given algebra one lesson that's just taught like literally millions of times, um, by different people."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "What should happen is that there's the small handful of explanations online, uh, that exists so that when someone needs that explanation, they can go to it, that the time in classroom is spent on all of the parts of teaching and education that aren't explanation, which is most of it."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "Um, and the way to get there is to basically have more people who are already explaining, publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forum."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "So if during a pandemic you can have people automatically creating online content cause it has to be online, but getting into the habit of doing it in a, um, in a way that doesn't just feel like a zoom call that happened to be recorded, but it actually feels like a, a piece that was always going to be publicized to more people than just your students that can be really powerful."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And there's an improvement process there, like so being self critical and growing, like, you know, like I guess YouTubers go through this process of like putting out some content and like nobody caring about it and then trying to figure out like, and basically improving figure out like, why did nobody care?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "What can I, you know, and they come up with all kinds of answers, which may or may not be correct, but doesn't matter because the answer leads to improvement."}, {"time": 4535, "text":

interested in like crisping it up, like, you know, making it, uh, you know, innovating in different kinds of ways."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And he was inspired by the work you do, because I think in his work, he can do similar kinds of explanations as you're doing, like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months in preparing a single video."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "Uh, and he's interested in how to do that."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "That's why he listened to the conversation."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "He was asking, you know, what kind of equipment do you recommend?"},

do you, for my narration, I use a USB mic for the streams that used to lapel mic, uh, the narration, it's a blue Yeti."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Um, I'm forgetting actually the name of the lapel mic,

weird when you hear your own voice."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So you hear it, you're like, this sounds weird and it's hard to notice it sound weird because you're not used to your own voice or they're like actual audio artifacts at play."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "Um, so, uh, and then video is just for the lockdown, just the camera, like you said, it was probably streaming somehow through the, yeah, there were two GH five cameras."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "One that was mounted overhead over a piece of paper."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "You could also use like an iPad or a Wacom tablet

actually the one to ask this cause I like animate stuff usually, but, uh, each of them like has a compressor object that makes it such that the camera output goes into the computer USB, but like gets compressed before it does that."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "The, the live aspect of it, do you, do you regret doing it live?"}, {"time": 4761, "text": "Um, I think I do think the content might be like

be one of those handfuls in a world where you have commoditized explanation, right?"}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Most of the lectures should be done just normally."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "Um, so put

like he teaches his main thing, his thing he's deeply passionate about."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "And from a selfish perspective, it's also just like, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's like publishing a

just, you can't put fences around it."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "But anyway, the reason I bring that up is Joe's going to remove his entire library from YouTube."}, {"time": 5354, "text": "Whoa, really?"}, {"time": 5356, "text": "His full length, the clips are going to stay, but the full length videos are all, I mean, made private or deleted."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "That's part of the deal."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "And like, that's the first time where I was like, Oh, YouTube videos might not live forever."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "Like things you find like, okay, I'm sorry."},

all of these videos that we're hosting are pretty costly."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "So we're just, we're going to start deleting the ones that aren't watched that much and tell people to like try to back them up on their own or whatever it is."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "Um, or even if it does exist in some form forever, it's like if people are, um, not habituated to watching YouTube in 50 years,

beautiful aspect of neural networks and machine learning to you, like for making those videos from watching how the field is evolving?"}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Is there something mathematically or in applied sense, just beautiful to you about them?"}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Well, I think what I would go to is the layered structure and how, um, you can have what feel like qualitatively distinct things happening, going from one layer to another, but that are, um, following the same mathematical rule because you look at it as a piece of math."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "It's like you got a non

the visualizations that, uh, like Chris Ola has done with respect to, um, like convolutional nets that have been trained on image net trying to say, what does this neuron do?"}, {"time": 5594, "text": "What do this, uh, does this family of neurons do?"}, {"time": 5597, "text": "What you can see is that, um, the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low level ideas like the texture,

it's the same piece of math on each one."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "So that's a pretty beautiful idea that you can have like a generalizable object that, um, runs through the layers of abstraction,

abstracting, which, I mean, that just feels very powerful."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "Um, and the idea that it can be so simply mathematically represented."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "I mean, a ton of like modern ML research seems a little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc things, then you decide which one worked and then you retrospectively come up with the mathematical reason that it always had to work."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Um, but you know, who cares how you came to it when you have like that elegant piece of math?"}, {"time": 5660, "text": "Uh, it's hard not to just smile seeing it work in action."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Well, and when you talked about topology before, one of the really interesting things is, is beginning to be investigated under kind of the field of like science and deep learning, which is like the craziness of the surface that, uh, is trying to be optimized, uh, in neural networks."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "I mean, the, the amount of local minima,

dimensional, like GPT three, what did it have?"}, {"time": 5710, "text": "175 billion parameters."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "So it doesn't feel as mesmerizing to think about, Oh, there's some surface of intelligent behavior in this crazy high dimensional space."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Um, yeah, it's just that, that there's so many good solutions, probably infinitely infinitely many good solutions, not best solutions, but good solutions."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "That's that's what's interesting."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "It's similar to, uh, Steven Wolfram has this idea of like the, if you just look at all space of computations of all space of basically algorithms that you'd be surprised how many of them are actually intelligent."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "Like if you just randomly pick from the bucket, uh, that's surprising."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "We tend to think like a tiny, tiny minority of them would be intelligent, but his sense is like, it seems weirdly easy to find computations that do something interesting."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "Well, okay, so that from like a calm agor, calm agor of complexity standpoint, almost everything will be interesting."},

you know, um, Shannon's noisy coding and theorem, uh, noisy coding theorem and, uh, information theory that basically says if, you know, I want to send some bits to you, um, maybe, uh, some of them are going to get flipped."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "Uh, there's some noise along the channel."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "I can come up with some way of coding it."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "That's resilient to that noise."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "Um, and then he quantitatively describes what very good is."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "What's funny about how he proves the existence of good error correction codes is rather than saying like, here's how to construct it or even like a sensible nonconstructive proof."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "The nature of his nonconstructive proof is to say, um, if we chose a random encoding, it would be almost at the limit, which is weird because then it took decades for people to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limit."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And what his proof was saying is choose a random one."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "And it's like the best kind of encoding you'll ever find."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "But what's what that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element from this ungodly huge set, that's a very different task from finding an efficient way to actively describe it."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "Cause in that case, the random element to actually implement it as a bit of code, you would just have this huge table of like, um, telling you how to encode one thing into another."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "That's totally computationally infeasible."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "So on the side of like how many possible programs are interesting in some way, it's like, yeah, tons of them."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "But the much, much more delicate question is when you can have a low information description of something that still becomes interesting."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And thereby this kind of gives you a blueprint for how to engineer that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "Chaos theory is another good instance there where it's like, yeah, a ton of things are hard to describe, but how do you have ones that have a simple set of governing equations that remain like arbitrarily hard to describe?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "Well, let me ask you, uh, you mentioned GPT three."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "It's interesting to ask, uh, what are your thoughts about the recently released open AI GPT three model that I believe is already trying to learn how to communicate like Grant Sanderson?"}, {"time": 5927, "text": "You know, I think I got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to, um, try to use GPT three with manum where you would like give it a high level description of something and then it'll like automatically create the mathematical animation, like trying to put me out of a job here."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "I mean, it probably won't put you out of a job, but it'll create something visually beautiful for sure."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "I would be surprised if that worked as stated, but maybe there's like variants of it like that you can get to."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "Um, I mean like a lot of those demos, it's interesting."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "I think, uh, there's a lot of failed experiments, like depending on how you prime the thing, you're going to have a lot of failed, I'm certainly with code and program synthesis."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "Most of it won't even run, but eventually I think if you, if you're, if you pick the right examples, you'll be able to generate something cool."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "And I think that even that's good enough, even though if it's, if it's, if you're being very selective, it's still cool that something can be generated."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "That's a huge value."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "Um, I mean, think of the writing process."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "Sometimes a big part of it is just getting a bunch of stuff on the page and then you can decide what to whittle down to."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "So if it can be used in like a man machine symbiosis where it's just giving you a spew of potential ideas that then you can refine down, um, like it's serving as the generator and then the human serves as the refiner."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "That seems like a pretty powerful dynamic."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Have you, uh, have you gotten a chance to see any of the demos like on Twitter?"}, {"time": 6014, "text": "Is there a favorite you've seen or?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "Oh, my absolute favorite."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "Uh, so Tim Blay who runs a channel called acapella science, he was like tweeting a bunch about playing with it."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "Um, and so he, so GPT three was trained on the internet from before COVID."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "So in a sense it doesn't know about the Corona virus."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "So what he seeded it with was just a short description about like, um, a novel virus, uh, emerges in Wuhan, China and starts to spread around the globe."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "What follows is a month by month description of what happens, January, colon, right?"}, {"time": 6046, "text": "That's what he sees it with."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "So then what GPT three generates is like January, then a paragraph of description, February and such."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And it's the funniest thing you'll ever read because, um, it predicts a zombie apocalypse, which of course it would because it's trained on like the internet, the stories, but what you see unfolding is a description of COVID 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "And like the early aspects of it are kind of shockingly in line with what's reasonable and then it gets out of hand so quickly."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And the other flip side of that is, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's onto something at some point here when, you know, 2020 has been full of surprises, who knows, like we might all be in like this crazy militarized zone as it predicts just a couple of months off."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "I think there's definitely an interesting tool of storytelling."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "I honestly haven't dug into like what's going on within it, uh, in a way that I can speak intelligently to, I guess it doesn't surprise me that it's bad at numerical patterns because I mean, maybe I should be more impressed with it, but like that requires having, um, a weird combination of intuitive and, uh, and formulaic worldview."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So you're not just going off of intuition."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "When you see Fibonacci numbers, you're not saying like intuitively, what do I think will follow the 13?"}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Like I've seen patterns a lot where like 13s are followed by 21s instead."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "It's the, like the way you're starting to see a shape of things is by knowing what hypotheses to test where you're saying, oh, maybe it's generated based on the previous terms or maybe it's generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you like have a bunch of different hypotheses and your intuitions are around those hypotheses, but you still need to actively test it."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "Um, and it seems like GPT three is extremely good at, um, like that sort of pattern matching recognition that usually is very hard for computers."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "That is what humans get good at through expertise and exposure to lots of things."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "It's why it's good to learn from as many examples as you can rather than just from the definitions it's to get that level of intuition, but to actually concretize it into a piece of math, you do need to, um, like test your hypotheses and if not prove it, um, like have an actual explanation for what's going on, not just a, uh, a pattern that you've seen."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And, but then the flip side to play devil's advocate, that's a very kind of probably correct intuitive understanding of just like we said, a few, a few layers creating abstractions, but it's been able to form something that looks like, uh, a compression of the data that it's seen that looks awfully a lot like it understands what the heck it's talking about."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "Well, I think a lot of understanding is like, I don't mean to denigrate pattern recognition."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "Pattern recognition is most of understanding and it's super important and it's super hard."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "Um, and so like when it's demonstrating this kind of real understanding, compressing down some data, like that, that might be pattern recognition at its finest."}, {"time": 6260, "text": "My only point would be that like what differentiates math, I think to a large extent is that, um, the pattern recognition isn't sufficient and that the kind of patterns that you're recognizing are not like the end goals, but instead they're, they are the little bits and paths that get you to the end goal."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "That's certainly true for mathematics in general."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "It's an interesting question if that might, uh, for certain kinds of series of numbers, it might not be true."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "Like you might, um, because that's a basic, you know, like Taylor's like certain kinds of series, it feels like compressing the internet, uh, is, is enough to figure out because those patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Well, I mean, there's, uh, there's all sorts of wonderful examples of false patterns in math where, um, one of the earliest videos I put on the channel was talking about the extent of dividing a circle up using these chords."}, {"time": 6315, "text": "And you see this pattern of one, two, four, eight, 16, I was like, okay, pretty easy to see what that pattern is."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "It's powers of two."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "You've seen it a million times."}, {"time": 6323, "text": "Um, but it's not powers of two."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "The next term is 31."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "And so it's like almost a power of two, but it's a little bit shy."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "And there's, there's actually a very good explanation for what's going on."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "So at best, if it did turn out to be powers of two, it would have only been so very subtly."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "And I think the difference between like, you know, a math student making the mistake and a mathematician who's experienced seeing that kind of pattern is that they, they'll have a sense from what the problem itself is, whether the pattern that they're observing is reasonable and how to test it."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "And like, uh, I w I would just be very impressed if there was any algorithm that, um, was actively accomplishing that goal."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "Like a learning base algorithm."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "Like a little scientist, I guess."}, {"time": 6389, "text": "Basically."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "That's a fascinating thought because GPT three, these language models are already accomplishing way more than I've expected."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "So I'm learning not to doubt, but we'll get there."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "I, I, I'm not saying I'd be impressed, but like surprised, like I'll be impressed, but I think we'll get there on, um, algorithms doing math like that."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So one of the amazing things you've done for the world is to some degree, open sourcing the tooling that you use to make your videos with Madam, uh, this Python library."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "Now it's quickly evolving because I think you're inventing new things every time you make a video."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "In fact, I wanted, um, I've been working on playing around with something."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "I wanted to do like an ode to three blue on Brown."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "Like I love playing Hendrix."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "I wanted to do like a cover, you know, of a concept I wanted to visualize and use Madam."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "And I saw that you had like a little piece of code on like Mobia strip and I tried to do some cool things with spinning a Mobia strip, like continue, um, twisting it, I guess is the term, uh, and it was easier to, uh, it was tough."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "So I haven't figured it out yet."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "Well, so I guess the question I want to ask is so many people love it, uh, that you've put that out there."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "They want to, uh, do the same thing as I do with Hendrix and want to cover it."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "They want to explain an idea using the tool, including Russ."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "How would you recommend they try to, I'm very sorry."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "They try to go, they try to go by, uh, about it and what kind of choices should they choose to be most effective?"}, {"time": 6493, "text": "That I can answer."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "So I always feel guilty if this comes up because, um, I think of it like this scrappy tool."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "It's like a math teacher who put together some code."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "People asked what it was, so they made it open source and they kept scrapping it together."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And there's a lot, like a lot of things about it that make it harder to work with than it needs to be that are a function of like me not being a software engineer."}, {"time": 6513, "text": "Um, I, I've, I've put some work this year trying to like make it better and more flexible."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Um, that is still just kind of like a work in process."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "Um, one thing I would love to do is just get my act together about properly integrating with what like the community wants to work with and like what stuff I work on and making that, um, not like deviate, uh, and just like actually fostering that community in a way that I've, I've been like shamefully neglectful of."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "So I'm just always guilty if it comes up."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "So let's put that guilt aside, just kind of Zen, like I'll pretend like it isn't terrible for someone like Russ."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Um, I think step one is like, make sure that what you're animating should be done so programmatically because a lot of things maybe shouldn't."}, {"time": 6556, "text": "Um, like if you're just making a quick graph of something, uh, if it's a graphical intuition that maybe has a little motion to it, use Desmos, use grapher, use GeoGebra, use Mathematica, certain things that are like really oriented around graph."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "GeoGebra is kind of cool."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "I did super amazing."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "You can get very, very far with it."}, {"time": 6573, "text": "Um, and in a lot of ways, like it would make more sense for STEM stuff that I do to just do in GeoGebra, but I kind of have this cycle of liking to try to improve man and by doing videos and such."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "So, uh, do as I say, not as I do."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "The original like thought I had in making manum was that there's so many different ways of representing functions other than graphs, um, in particular things like transformations, like use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead of like estimate direction and Y

concepts that are like within reach."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "Yeah, I think that's super important."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "I mean, so you see this in math too with, um, the big unsolved

sort of mature to a point where you realize that, uh, you should spend your brain cycles on problems that you will see resolved because then you're going to grow to see what it feels like for these

get in that habit."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "I think the popularization of physics should encourage that habit through things like the physics of simple everyday phenomena, because it can get quite deep."}, {"time": 7310, "text": "And um, yeah, I think I, you know, I've, I've heard a lot of the interest that, you know, people send me messages asking to explain Weinstein's thing or asking to

681, "text": "Like people can tell when a programming language is good or when it was an accident, right?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "And one of the things with Swift in particular is that a tremendous amount of time by a tremendous number of people have been put into really polishing and making it feel good."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But it also has really good nuts and bolts underneath it."},

and you get all these kinds of bugs that then you have spent tons of time debugging and it's a real pain in the butt and you feel unproductive."}, {"time": 737, "text": "And so by subtracting these things from the experience, you get happier people."}, {"time": 742, "text": "But again, keep interrupting."}, {"time": 745, "text": "I'm sorry, but so hard to deal with."}, {"time": 749, "text": "If you look at the people that are most productive on Stack Overflow, they have a set of priorities that may not always correlate perfectly with the experience of the majority of users."}, {"time": 763, "text": "If you look at the most upvoted, quote unquote, correct answer on Stack Overflow, it usually really sort of prioritizes like safe code, proper code, stable code, you know, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 781, "text": "As opposed to like, if I wanna use go to statements in my basic, right?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "I wanna use go to statements."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Like what if 99% of people wanna use go to statements?"}, {"time": 792, "text": "So you use completely improper, you know, unsafe syntax."}, {"time": 796, "text": "I don't think that people actually, like if you boil it down and you get below the surface level, people don't actually care about go tos or if statements or things like this."}, {"time": 804, "text": "They care about achieving a goal, right?"}, {"time": 806, "text": "So the real question is I wanna set up a web server and I wanna do a thing, whatever."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like how quickly can I achieve that, right?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "And so from a programming language perspective, there's really two things that matter there."}, {"time": 819, "text": "One is what libraries exist and then how quickly can you put it together and what are the tools around that look like, right?"}, {"time": 827, "text": "And when you wanna build a library that's missing, what do you do?"}, {"time": 830, "text": "Okay, now this is where you see huge divergence in the force between worlds, okay?"}, {"time": 835, "text": "And so you look at Python, for example."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Python is really good at assembling things, but it's not so great at building all the libraries."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And so what you get because of performance reasons, other things like this, is you get Python layered on top of C, for example, and that means that doing certain kinds of things well, it doesn't really make sense to do in Python."}, {"time": 853, "text": "Instead you do it in C and then you wrap it and then you have, you're living in two worlds and two worlds never is really great because tooling and the debugger doesn't work right and like all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Can you clarify a little bit what you mean by Python is not good at building libraries, meaning it doesn't make it conducive."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Certain kinds of libraries."}, {"time": 871, "text": "No, but just the actual meaning of the sentence, meaning like it's not conducive to developers to come in and add libraries or is it the duality of the, it's a dance between Python and C and... Well, so Python's amazing."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Python's a great language."}, {"time": 890, "text": "I did not mean to say that Python is bad for libraries."}, {"time": 893, "text": "What I meant to say is there are libraries that Python's really good at that you can write in Python, but there are other things, like if you wanna build a machine learning framework, you're not gonna build a machine learning framework in Python because of performance, for example, or you want GPU acceleration or things like this."}, {"time": 910, "text": "Instead, what you do is you write a bunch of C or C++ code or something like that, and then you talk to it from Python, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "And so this is because of decisions that were made in the Python design and those decisions have other counterbalancing forces."}, {"time": 927, "text": "But the trick when you start looking at this from a programming language perspective, you start to say, okay, cool."}, {"time": 933, "text": "How do I build this catalog of libraries that are really powerful?"}, {"time": 937, "text": "And how do I make it so that then they can be assembled into ways that feel good and they generally work the first time?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "Because when you're talking about building a thing, you have to include the debugging, the fixing, the turnaround cycle, the development cycle, all that kind of stuff into the process of building the thing."}, {"time": 956, "text": "It's not just about pounding out the code."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And so this is where things like catching bugs at compile time is valuable, for example."}, {"time": 964, "text": "But if you dive into the details in this, Swift, for example, has certain things like value semantics, which is this fancy way of saying that when you treat a variable like a value, it acts like a mathematical object would."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Okay, so you have used PyTorch a little bit."}, {"time": 985, "text": "In PyTorch, you have tensors."}, {"time": 986, "text": "Tensors are n dimensional grid of numbers, very simple."}, {"time": 991, "text": "You can do plus and other operators on them."}, {"time": 994, "text": "It's all totally fine."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But why do you need to clone a tensor sometimes?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "Have you ever run into that?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Okay, and so why is that?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Why do you need to clone a tensor?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "It's the usual object thing that's in Python."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So in Python, and just like with Java and many other languages, this isn't unique to Python."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "In Python, it has a thing called reference semantics, which is the nerdy way of explaining this."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And what that means is you actually have a pointer do a thing instead of the thing, okay?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "Now, this is due to a bunch of implementation details that you don't want to go into."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "But in Swift, you have this thing called value semantics."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And so when you have a tensor in Swift, it is a value."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "If you copy it, it looks like you have a unique copy."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And if you go change one of those copies, then it doesn't update the other one because you just made a copy of this thing, right?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So that's like highly error prone in at least computer science, math centric disciplines about Python, that like the thing you would expect to behave like math."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Like math, it doesn't behave like math."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And in fact, quietly it doesn't behave like math and then can ruin the entirety of your math thing."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Well, and then it puts you in debugging land again."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Right now, you just want to get something done and you're like, wait a second, where do I need to put clone?"}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And what level of the stack, which is very complicated, which I thought I was reusing somebody's library and now I need to understand it to know where to clone a thing, right?"}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And hard to debug, by the way."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And so this is where programming languages really matter."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Right, and so in Swift having value semantics so that both you get the benefit of math, working like math, right?"}, {"time": 1092, "text": "But also the efficiency that comes with certain advantages there, certain implementation details there really benefit you as a programmer, right?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Can you clarify the value semantics?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Like how do you know that a thing should be treated like a value?"}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Yeah, so Swift has a pretty strong culture and good language support for defining values."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And so if you have an array, so tensors are one example that the machine learning folks are very used to."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Just think about arrays, same thing, where you have an array, you create an array, you put two or three or four things into it, and then you pass it off to another function."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "What happens if that function adds some more things to it?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Well, you'll see it on the side that you pass it in, right?"}, {"time": 1134, "text": "This is called reference semantics."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Now, what if you pass an array off to a function, it scrolls it away in some dictionary or some other data structure somewhere, right?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Well, it thought that you just handed it that array, then you return back and that reference to that array still exists in the caller, and they go and put more stuff in it, right?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "The person you handed it off to may have thought they had the only reference to that, and so they didn't know that this was gonna change underneath the covers."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And so this is where you end up having to do clone."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "So like I was passed a thing, I'm not sure if I have the only version of it, so now I have to clone it."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "So what value semantics does is it allows you to say, hey, I have a, so in Swift, it defaults to value semantics."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Oh, so it defaults to value semantics, and then because most things should end up being like values, then it makes sense for that to be the default."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And one of the important things about that is that arrays and dictionaries and all these other collections that are aggregations of other things also have value semantics."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And so when you pass this around to different parts of your program, you don't have to do these defensive copies."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And so this is great for two sides, right?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "It's great because you define away the bug, which is a big deal for productivity, the number one thing most people care about, but it's also good for performance because when you're doing a clone, so you pass the array down to the thing, it's like, I don't know if anybody else has it, I have to clone it."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Well, you just did a copy of a bunch of data."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "It could be big."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And then it could be that the thing that called you is not keeping track of the old thing."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "So you just made a copy of it, and you may not have had to."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And so the way the value semantics work in Swift is it uses this thing called copy on write, which means that you get the benefit of safety and performance."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And it has another special trick because if you think certain languages like Java, for example, they have immutable strings."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And so what they're trying to do is they provide value semantics by having pure immutability."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Functional languages have pure immutability in lots of different places, and this provides a much safer model and it provides value semantics."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "The problem with this is if you have immutability, everything is expensive."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Everything requires a copy."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "For example, in Java, if you have a string X and a string Y, you append them together, we have to allocate a new string to hold X, Y."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "If they're immutable."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Well, strings in Java are immutable."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And if there's optimizations for short ones, it's complicated, but generally think about them as a separate allocation."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And so when you append them together, you have to go allocate a third thing because somebody might have a pointer to either of the other ones, right?"}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And you can't go change them."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So you have to go allocate a third thing."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Because of the beauty of how the Swift value semantics system works out, if you have a string in Swift and you say, hey, put in X, right?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "And they say, append on Y, Z, W, it knows that there's only one reference to that."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And so it can do an in place update."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And so you're not allocating tons of stuff on the side."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "You don't have all those problems."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "When you pass it off, you can know you have the only reference."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "If you pass it off to multiple different people, but nobody changes it, they can all share the same thing."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So you get a lot of the benefit of purely immutable design."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And so you get a really nice sweet spot that I haven't seen in other languages."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "Yeah, that's interesting."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I thought there was going to be a philosophical narrative here that you're gonna have to pay a cost for it."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "Cause it sounds like, I think value semantics is beneficial for easing of debugging or minimizing the risk of errors, like bringing the errors closer to the source, bringing the symptom of the error closer to the source of the error, however you say that."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But you're saying there's not a performance cost either if you implement it correctly."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Well, so there's trade offs with everything."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And so if you are doing very low level stuff, then sometimes you can notice a cost, but then what you're doing is you're saying, what is the right default?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So coming back to user interface, when you talk about programming languages, one of the major things that Swift does that makes people love it, that is not obvious when it comes to designing a language is this UI principle of progressive disclosure of complexity."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Okay, so Swift, like many languages is very powerful."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "The question is, when do you have to learn the power as a user?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "So Swift, like Python, allows you to start with like, print hello world, right?"}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Certain other languages start with like, public static void main class, like all the ceremony, right?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And so you go to teach a new person, hey, welcome to this new thing."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Let's talk about public access control classes."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "Wait, what's that?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "String system.out.println, like packages, like, God, right?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And so instead, if you take this and you say, hey, we need packages, modules, we need powerful things like classes, we need data structures, we need like all these things."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "The question is, how do you factor the complexity?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And how do you make it so that the normal case scenario is you're dealing with things that work the right way in the right way, give you good performance by default, but then as a power user, if you want to dive down to it, you have full C performance, full control over low level pointers."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "You can call malloc if you want to call malloc."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "This is not recommended on the first page of every tutorial, but it's actually really important when you want to get work done, right?"}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And so being able to have that is really the design in programming language design, and design is really, really hard."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "It's something that I think a lot of people kind of, outside of UI, again, a lot of people just think is subjective, like there's nothing, you know, it's just like curly braces or whatever."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "It's just like somebody's preference, but actually good design is something that you can feel."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And how many people are involved with good design?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So if we looked at Swift, but look at historically, I mean, this might touch like, it's almost like a Steve Jobs question too, like how much dictatorial decision making is required versus collaborative, and we'll talk about how all that can go wrong or right, but."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Yeah, well, Swift, so I can't speak to in general, all design everywhere."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So the way it works with Swift is that there's a core team, and so a core team is six or seven people ish, something like that, that is people that have been working with Swift since very early days, and so."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And by early days is not that long ago."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Okay, yeah, so it became public in 2014, so it's been six years public now, but so that's enough time that there's a story arc there."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "Okay, yeah, and there's mistakes have been made that then get fixed, and you learn something, and then you, you know, and so what the core team does is it provides continuity, and so you wanna have a, okay, well, there's a big hole that we wanna fill."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "We know we wanna fill it, so don't do other things that invade that space until we fill the hole, right?"}, {"time": 1559, "text": "There's a boulder that's missing here, we wanna do, we will do that boulder, even though it's not today, keep out of that space."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "And the whole team remembers the myth of the boulder that's there."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "Yeah, yeah, there's a general sense of what the future looks like in broad strokes, and a shared understanding of that, combined with a shared understanding of what has happened in the past that worked out well and didn't work out well."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "The next level out is you have the, what's called the Swift evolution community, and you've got, in that case, hundreds of people that really care passionately about the way Swift evolves, and that's like an amazing thing to, again, the core team doesn't necessarily need to come up with all the good ideas."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "You got hundreds of people out there that care about something, and they come up with really good ideas too, and that provides this rock tumbler for ideas."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And so the evolution process is, a lot of people in a discourse forum, they're like hashing it out and trying to talk about, okay, well, should we go left or right, or if we did this, what would be good?"}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So does that group represent like the, how much people will love the user interface?"}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Like, do you think they're able to capture that?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Well, I mean, it's something we talk about a lot, it's something we care about."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "How well we do that's up for debate, but I think that we've done pretty well so far."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Is the beginner in mind?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Like, because you said the progressive disclosure complexity."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Yeah, so we care a lot about that, a lot about power, a lot about efficiency, a lot about, there are many factors to good design, and you have to figure out a way to kind of work your way through that, and."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So if you think about, like the language I love is Lisp, probably still because I use Emacs, but I haven't done anything, any serious work in Lisp, but it has a ridiculous amount of parentheses."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "I've also, you know, with Java and C++, the braces, you know, I like, I enjoyed the comfort of being between braces, you know?"}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Yeah, yeah, well, let's talk."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And then Python is, sorry to interrupt, just like, and last thing to me, as a designer, if I was a language designer, God forbid, is I would be very surprised that Python with no braces would nevertheless somehow be comforting also."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "So like, I could see arguments for all of this."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "But look at this, this is evidence that it's not about braces versus tabs."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Right, exactly, you're good, that's a good point."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "Right, so like, you know, there's evidence that."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "But see, like, it's one of the most argued about things."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Oh yeah, of course, just like tabs and spaces, which it doesn't, I mean, there's one obvious right answer, but it doesn't actually matter."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Let's not, like, come on, we're friends."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Like, come on, what are you trying to do to me here?"}, {"time": 1743, "text": "People are gonna, yeah, half the people are gonna tune out."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Yeah, so these, so you're able to identify things that don't really matter for the experience."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "Well, no, no, no, it's always a really hard, so the easy decisions are easy, right?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "I mean, fine, those are not the interesting ones."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "The hard ones are the ones that are most interesting, right?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "The hard ones are the places where, hey, we wanna do a thing, everybody agrees we should do it, there's one proposal on the table, but it has all these bad things associated with it."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Well, okay, what are we gonna do about that?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Do we just take it?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Do we delay it?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "Do we say, hey, well, maybe there's this other feature that if we do that first, this will work out better."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "How does this, if we do this, are we paying ourselves into a corner, right?"}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And so this is where, again, you're having that core team of people that has some continuity and has perspective, has some of the historical understanding, is really valuable because you get, it's not just like one brain, you get the power of multiple people coming together to make good decisions, and then you get the best out of all these people, and you also can harness the community around it."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And what about the decision of whether in Python having one type or having strict typing?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "Yeah, let's talk about this."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So I like how you put that, by the way."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So many people would say that Python doesn't have types."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "Doesn't have types, yeah."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I haven't listened to you enough to where, I'm a fan of yours and I've listened to way too many podcasts and videos of you talking about this stuff."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "Oh yeah, so I would argue that Python has one type."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And so like when you import Python into Swift, which by the way works really well, you have everything comes in as a Python object."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Now here are their trade offs because it depends on what you're optimizing for."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And Python is a super successful language for a really good reason."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Because it has one type, you get duck typing for free and things like this."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "But also you're pushing, you're making it very easy to pound out code on one hand, but you're also making it very easy to introduce complicated bugs that you have to debug."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And you pass a string into something that expects an integer and it doesn't immediately die."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It goes all the way down the stack trace and you find yourself in the middle of some code that you really didn't want to know anything about."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And it blows up and you're just saying, well, what did I do wrong, right?"}, {"time": 1878, "text": "And so types are good and bad and they have trade offs."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "They're good for performance and certain other things depending on where you're coming from, but it's all about trade offs."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "And so this is what design is, right?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Design is about weighing trade offs and trying to understand the ramifications of the things that you're weighing, like types or not, or one type or many types."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "But also within many types, how powerful do you make that type system is another very complicated question with lots of trade offs."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "It's very interesting by the way, but that's like one dimension and there's a bunch of other dimensions, JIT compiled versus static compiled, garbage collected versus reference counted versus manual memory management versus, like in like all these different trade offs and how you balance them are what make a program language good."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "Concurrency."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So in all those things, I guess, when you're designing the language, you also have to think of how that's gonna get all compiled down to."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "If you care about performance, yeah."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "Well, and go back to Lisp, right?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So Lisp also, I would say JavaScript is another example of a very simple language, right?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "And so one of the, so I also love Lisp."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "I don't use it as much as maybe you do or you did."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "No, I think we're both, everyone who loves Lisp, it's like, you love, it's like, I don't know, I love Frank Sinatra, but like how often do I seriously listen to Frank Sinatra?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "But you look at that or you look at JavaScript, which is another very different, but relatively simple language."},

the most important inherent complexity in the language, then what ends up happening is that complexity gets pushed elsewhere."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And when it gets pushed elsewhere, sometimes

balance that?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Don't put too much stuff in the language because that's really expensive and it makes things complicated."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But how do you model enough of the inherent complexity of the problem that you provide the framework and the structure for people to think about?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "Well, so the key thing to think about with

to interrupt, Swift UI, and then there's a thing called UI Kit."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So can I build an app with Swift?"}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Well, so that's the thing, is the ecosystem is what matters there."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "So Swift UI and UI Kit are Apple technologies."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And so they happen to, like Swift UI happens to be written in Swift, but it's

{"time": 2439, "text": "And so Android has a different ecosystem of things that hasn't been built out and doesn't work as well with Swift."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And so you can totally use Swift to do like arithmetic and things like this, but building UI with Swift on Android is not a great experience right now."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "So if I wanted to learn Swift, what's the, I mean, the one practical different version of that is Swift for TensorFlow, for example."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "And one of the inspiring things for me with both TensorFlow and PyTorch is how quickly the community can like switch from different libraries, like you could see some of the communities switching to PyTorch now, but it's very easy to see."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "And then TensorFlow is really stepping up its game."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And then there's no reason why, I think the way it works is basically it has to be one GitHub repo, like one paper steps up."}, {"time": 2491,

learn and they fall in love with it."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "I mean, that's what happened, PyTorch has it."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "There has to be a reason, a catalyst."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so, and there, I mean, people don't like change, but it turns out that once you've worked with one or two programming languages, the basics are pretty similar."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "And so one of the fun things about learning programming languages, even maybe Lisp, I don't know if you agree with this, is that when you start doing that, you start learning new things."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Cause you have a new way to do things and you're forced to do them."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "And that forces you to explore and it puts you in learning mode."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And when you get in learning mode, your mind kind of opens a little bit and you can see things in a new way, even when you go back to the old place."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Yeah, it's totally, well Lisp is functional."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "But yeah, I wish there was a kind of window, maybe you can tell me if there is, there you go."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "This is a question to ask, what is the most beautiful feature in a programming language?"}, {"time": 2550, "text": "Before I ask it, let me say like with Python, I remember I saw Lisp comprehensions."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "Was like, when I like really took it in."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "I don't know, I just loved it."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "It was like fun to do, like it was fun to do that kind of, something about it to be able to filter through a list and to create a new list all in a single line was elegant."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I could all get into my head and it just made me fall in love with the language."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So is there, let me ask you a question."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Is there, what do you use the most beautiful feature in a programming languages that you've ever encountered in Swift maybe and then outside of Swift?"}, {"time": 2595, "text": "I think the thing that I like the most from a programming language."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "So I think the thing you have to think about with the programming language, again, what is the goal?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "You're trying to get people to get things done quickly."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And so you need libraries, you need high quality libraries and then you need a user base around them that can assemble them and do cool things with them, right?"}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And so to me, the question is what enables high quality libraries?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And there's a huge divide in the world between libraries who enable high quality libraries versus the ones that put special stuff in the language."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So programming languages that enable high quality libraries?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "So, and what I mean by that is expressive libraries that then feel like a natural integrated part of the language itself."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "So an example of this in Swift is that int and float and also array and string, things like this, these are all part of the library."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Like int is not hard coded into Swift."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so what that means is that because int is just a library thing defined in the standard library, along with strings and arrays and all the other things that come with the standard library."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Well, hopefully you do like int, but anything that any language features that you needed to define int, you can also use in your own types."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So if you wanted to find a quaternion or something like this, right?"}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Well, it doesn't come in the standard library."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "There's a very special set of people that care a lot about this, but those people are also important."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "It's not about classism, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "It's not about the people who care about ints and floats are more important than the people who care about quaternions."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And so to me, the beautiful things about programming languages is when you allow those communities to build high quality libraries, they feel native."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "They feel like they're built into the compiler without having to be."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "What does it mean for the int to be part of not hard coded in?"}, {"time": 2713, "text": "So is it like how, so what is an int?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Okay, int is just a integer."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "In this case, it's like a 64 bit integer or something like this."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "But so like the 64 bit is hard coded or no?"}, {"time": 2728, "text": "No, none of that's hard coded."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So int, if you go look at how it's implemented, it's just a struct in Swift."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And so it's a struct."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "And then how do you add two structs?"}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Well, you define plus."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And so you can define plus on int."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Well, you can define plus on your thing too."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "You can define, int is an odd method or something like that on it."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "And so yeah, you can add methods on the things."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "So you can define operators, like how it behaves."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "That's just beautiful when there's something about the language which enables others to create libraries which are not hacky."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "Yeah, they feel native."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And so one of the best examples of this is Lisp, right?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "Because in Lisp, like all the libraries are basically part of the language, right?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "You write, turn, rewrite systems and things like this."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Can you as a counter example provide what makes it difficult to write a library that's native?"}, {"time": 2783, "text": "Is it the Python C?"}, {"time": 2785, "text": "Well, so one example, I'll give you two examples."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Java and C++, there's Java and C. They both allow you to define your own types, but int is hard code in the language."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Okay, well, why?"}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Well, in Java, for example, coming back to this whole reference semantic value semantic thing, int gets passed around by value."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "But if you make like a pair or something like that, a complex number, right, it's a class in Java."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "And now it gets passed around by reference, by pointer."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "And so now you lose value semantics, right?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "You lost math, okay."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Well, that's not great, right?"}, {"time": 2826, "text": "If you can do something with int, why can't I do it with my type, right?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "So that's the negative side of the thing I find beautiful is when you can solve that, when you can have full expressivity, where you as a user of the language have as much or almost as much power as the people who implemented all the standard built in stuff, because what that enables is that enables truly beautiful libraries."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "You know, it's kind of weird because I've gotten used to that."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "That's one, I guess, other aspect of program language design."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "You have to think, you know, the old first principles thinking, like, why are we doing it this way?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "By the way, I mean, I remember, because I was thinking about the walrus operator and I'll ask you about it later, but it hit me that like the equal sign for assignment."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "Like, why are we using the equal sign for assignment?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "It's wrong, yeah."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And that's not the only solution, right?"}, {"time": 2884, "text": "So if you look at Pascal, they use colon equals for assignment and equals for equality."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And they use like less than greater than instead of the not equal thing."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Like, there are other answers here."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "So, but like, and yeah, like I ask you all, but how do you then decide to break convention to say, you know what, everybody's doing it wrong."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "We're gonna do it right."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "So it's like an ROI, like return on investment trade off, right?"}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So if you do something weird, let's just say like not like colon equal instead of equal for assignment, that would be weird with today's aesthetic, right?"}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And so you'd say, cool, this is theoretically better, but is it better in which ways?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "Like, what do I get out of that?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "Do I define away class of bugs?"}, {"time": 2932, "text": "Well, one of the class of bugs that C has is that you can use like, you know, if X equals without equals equals X equals Y, right?"}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Well, turns out you can solve that problem in lots of ways."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "Clang, for example, GCC, all these compilers will detect that as a likely bug, produce a warning."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "I feel like they didn't."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Oh, Clang does."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "GCC didn't."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "It's like one of the important things about programming language design is like, you're literally creating suffering in the world."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "Like, I feel like, I mean, one way to see it is the bicycle for the mind, but the other way is to like minimizing suffering."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "Well, you have to decide if it's worth it, right?"}, {"time": 2973, "text": "And so let's come back to that."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "But if you look at this, and again, this is where there's a lot of detail that goes into each of these things."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Equal and C returns a value."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Is it messed up?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "That allows you to say X equals Y equals Z, like that works in C. Yeah."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "You know, most people think it's messed up, I think."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "It is very, by messed up, what I mean is it is very rarely used for good, and it's often used for bugs."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Right, and so."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "That's a good definition of messed up, yeah."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "You could use, you know, in hindsight, this was not such a great idea, right?"}, {"time": 3014, "text": "One of the things with Swift that is really powerful and one of the reasons it's actually good versus it being full of good ideas is that when we launched Swift 1, we announced that it was public, people could use it, people could build apps, but it was gonna change and break, okay?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "When Swift 2 came out, we said, hey, it's open source, and there's this open process which people can help evolve and direct the language."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So the community at large, like Swift users, can now help shape the language as it is."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And what happened as part of that process is a lot of really bad mistakes got taken out."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So for example, Swift used to have the C style plus plus and minus minus operators."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Like, what does it mean when you put it before versus after, right?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Well, that got cargo culted from C into Swift early on."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "What's cargo culted?"}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Cargo culted means brought forward without really considering it."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "This is maybe not the most PC term, but."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "You have to look it up in Urban Dictionary, yeah."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Yeah, so it got pulled into C without, or it got pulled into Swift without very good consideration."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "And we went through this process, and one of the first things got ripped out was plus plus and minus minus, because they lead to confusion."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "They have very low value over saying x plus equals one, and x plus equals one is way more clear."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And so when you're optimizing for teachability and clarity and bugs and this multidimensional space that you're looking at, things like that really matter."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And so being first principles on where you're coming from and what you're trying to achieve and being anchored on the objective is really important."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Well, let me ask you about the most, sort of this podcast isn't about information, it's about drama."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "Let me talk to you about some drama."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "So you mentioned Pascal and colon equals, there's something that's called the Walrus operator."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "And Python in Python 3.8 added the Walrus operator."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "And the reason I think it's interesting is not just because of the feature, it has the same kind of expression feature you can mention to see that it returns the value of the assignment."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "And then maybe you can comment on that in general, but on the other side of it, it's also the thing that toppled the dictator."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "So it finally drove Guido to step down from BDFL, the toxicity of the community."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So maybe what do you think about the Walrus operator in Python?"}, {"time": 3167, "text": "Is there an equivalent thing in Swift that really stress tested the community?"}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And then on the flip side, what do you think about Guido stepping down over it?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Yeah, well, if I look past the details of the Walrus operator, one of the things that makes it most polarizing is that it's syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "What do you mean by syntactic sugar?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "It means you can take something that already exists in the language and you can express it in a more concise way."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "So, okay, I'm going to play dollars advocate."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So this is great."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "Is that a objective or subjective statement?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Like, can you argue that basically anything isn't syntactic sugar or not?"}, {"time": 3207, "text": "No, not everything is syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So for example, the type system, like can you have classes versus, like, do you have types or not, right?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So one type versus many types is not something that affects syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And so if you say, I want to have the ability to define types, I have to have all this like language mechanics to define classes."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And oh, now I have to have inheritance."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And I have like, I have all this stuff that's just making the language more complicated."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "That's not about sugaring it."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Swift has the sugar."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "So like Swift has this thing called if let, and it has a lot of different types and it has various operators that are used to concisify specific use cases."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So the problem with syntactic sugar, when you're talking about, hey, I have a thing that takes a lot to write and I have a new way to write it."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "You have this like horrible trade off, which becomes almost completely subjective, which is how often does this happen and does it matter?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And one of the things that is true about human psychology, particularly when you're talking about introducing a new thing is that people overestimate the burden of learning something."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "And so it looks foreign when you haven't gotten used to it."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "But if it was there from the beginning, of course it's just part of Python."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "Like unquestionably, like this is just the thing I know."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And it's not a new thing that you're worried about learning."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "It's just part of the deal."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Now with Guido, I don't know Guido well."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Yeah, have you passed cross much?"}, {"time": 3296, "text": "Yeah, I've met him a couple of times, but I don't know Guido well."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "But the sense that I got out of that whole dynamic was that he had put the, not just the decision maker weight on his shoulders, but it was so tied to his personal identity that he took it personally and he felt the need and he kind of put himself in the situation of being the person, instead of building a base of support around him."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "I mean, this is probably not quite literally true, but by too much concentrated on him, right?"}, {"time": 3329, "text": "And that can wear you down."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "Well, yeah, particularly because people then say, Guido, you're a horrible person."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "I hate this thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And sure, it's like maybe 1% of the community that's doing that, but Python's got a big community."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "And 1% of millions of people is a lot of hate mail."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And that just from human factor will just wear on you."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "Well, to clarify, it looked from just what I saw in the messaging for the, let's not look at the million Python users, but at the Python core developers, it feels like the majority, the big majority on a vote were opposed to it."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Okay, I'm not that close to it, so I don't know."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Okay, so the situation is like literally, yeah, I mean, the majority of the core developers are against it."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Were opposed to it."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "So, and they weren't even like against it."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "It was, there was a few, well, they were against it, but the against it wasn't like, this is a bad idea."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "They were more like, we don't see why this is a good idea."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "And what that results in is there's a stalling feeling, like you just slow things down."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "Now, from my perspective, that you could argue this, and I think it's very interesting if we look at politics today and the way Congress works, it's slowed down everything."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "It's a dampener."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "Yeah, it's a dampener, but like, that's a dangerous thing too, because if it dampens things like, you know, if the dampening results."}, {"time": 3418, "text": "What are you talking about?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "Like, it's a low pass filter, but if you need billions of dollars injected into the economy or trillions of dollars, then suddenly stuff happens, right?"}, {"time": 3429, "text": "So you're talking about."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "I'm not defending our political situation, just to be clear."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "But you're talking about like a global pandemic."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "I was hoping we could fix like the healthcare system and the education system, like, you know."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "I'm not a politics person."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "When it comes to languages, the community's kind of right in terms of, it's a very high burden to add something to a language."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "So as soon as you add something, you have a community of people building on it and you can't remove it, okay?"}, {"time": 3458, "text": "And if there's a community of people that feel really uncomfortable with it, then taking it slow, I think, is an important thing to do."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And there's no rush, particularly if it was something that's 25 years old and is very established."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And, you know, it's not like coming into its own."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "What about features?"}, {"time": 3475, "text": "Well, so I think that the issue with Guido is that maybe this is a case where he realized it had outgrown him and it went from being the language."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "So Python, I mean, Guido's amazing, but Python isn't about Guido anymore."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "It's about the users."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And to a certain extent, the users own it."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And, you know, Guido spent years of his life, a significant fraction of his career on Python."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And from his perspective, I imagine he's like, well, this is my thing."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "I should be able to do the thing I think is right."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "But you can also understand the users where they feel like, you know, this is my thing."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "I use this, like, and I don't know, it's a hard thing."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "But what, if we could talk about leadership in this, because it's so interesting to me."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "I'm gonna make, I'm gonna work."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Hopefully somebody makes it."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "If not, I'll make it a Walrus Operator shirt, because I think it represents, to me, maybe it's my Russian roots or something."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "But, you know, it's the burden of leadership."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "Like, I feel like to push back, I feel like progress can only, like most difficult decisions, just like you said, there'll be a lot of divisiveness over, especially in a passionate community."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "It just feels like leaders need to take those risky decisions that if you like listen, that with some nonzero probability, maybe even a high probability would be the wrong decision."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But they have to use their gut and make that decision."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Well, this is like one of the things where you see amazing founders."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "The founders understand exactly what's happened and how the company got there and are willing to say, we have been doing thing X the last 20 years, but today we're gonna do thing Y."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "And they make a major pivot for the whole company."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "The company lines up behind them, they move and it's the right thing."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "But then when the founder dies, the successor doesn't always feel that agency to be able to make those kinds of decisions."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "Even though they're a CEO, they could theoretically do whatever."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "There's two reasons for that, in my opinion, or in many cases, it's always different."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "But one of which is they weren't there for all the decisions that were made."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "And so they don't know the principles in which those decisions were made."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And once the principles change, you should be obligated to change what you're doing and change direction, right?"}, {"time": 3622, "text": "And so if you don't know how you got to where you are, it just seems like gospel and you're not gonna question it."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "You may not understand that it really is the right thing to do, so you just may not see it."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "That's so brilliant."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Like it's so much higher burden when as a leader you step into a thing that's already worked for a long time."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Well, and if you change it and it doesn't work out, now you're the person who screwed it up."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "People always second guess it."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And the second thing is that even if you decide to make a change, even if you're theoretically in charge, you're just a person that thinks they're in charge."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "Meanwhile, you have to motivate the troops."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "You have to explain it to them in terms they'll understand."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "You have to get them to buy into it and believe in it, because if they don't, then they're not gonna be able to make the turn even if you tell them their bonuses are gonna be curtailed."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "They're just not gonna like buy into it, you know?"}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And so there's only so much power you have as a leader, and you have to understand what those limitations are."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Are you still BDFL?"}, {"time": 3678, "text": "You've been a BDFL of some stuff."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "You're very heavy on the B, the benevolent, benevolent dictator for life."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "I guess LLVM?"}, {"time": 3689, "text": "Yeah, so I still lead the LLVM world."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "I mean, what's the role of, so then on Swift you said that there's a group of people."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Yeah, so if you contrast Python with Swift, right, one of the reasons, so everybody on the core team takes the role really seriously, and I think we all really care about where Swift goes, but you're almost delegating the final decision making to the wisdom of the group, and so it doesn't become personal."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "And also, when you're talking with the community, so yeah, some people are very annoyed as certain decisions get made."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "There's a certain faith in the process, because it's a very transparent process, and when a decision gets made, a full rationale is provided, things like this."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "These are almost defense mechanisms to help both guide future discussions and provide case law, kind of like Supreme Court does about this decision was made for this reason, and here's the rationale and what we want to see more of or less of."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "But it's also a way to provide a defense mechanism, so that when somebody's griping about it, they're not saying that person did the wrong thing."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "They're saying, well, this thing sucks, and later they move on and they get over it."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Yeah, the analogy of the Supreme Court, I think, is really good."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "But then, okay, not to get personal on the SWIFT team, but it just seems like it's impossible for division not to emerge."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "Well, each of the humans on the SWIFT Core Team, for example, are different, and the membership of the SWIFT Core Team changes slowly over time, which is, I think, a healthy thing."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "And so each of these different humans have different opinions."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "Trust me, it's not a singular consciousness by any stretch of the imagination."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "You've got three major organizations, including Apple, Google, and SciFive, all kind of working together."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "And it's a small group of people, but you need high trust."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "You need, again, it comes back to the principles of what you're trying to achieve and understanding what you're optimizing for."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "And I think that starting with strong principles and working towards decisions is always a good way to both make wise decisions in general but then be able to communicate them to people so that they can buy into them."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "And that is hard."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "And so you mentioned LLVM."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "LLVM is gonna be 20 years old this December, so it's showing its own age."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "Do you have like a dragon cake plan?"}, {"time": 3833, "text": "No, I should definitely do that."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "Yeah, if we can have a pandemic cake."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "Pandemic cake."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Everybody gets a slice of cake and it gets sent through email."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "But LLVM has had tons of its own challenges over time too, right?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "And one of the challenges that the LLVM community has, in my opinion, is that it has a whole bunch of people that have been working on LLVM for 10 years, right?"}, {"time": 3859, "text": "Because this happens somehow."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And LLVM has always been one way, but it needs to be a different way, right?"}, {"time": 3865, "text": "And they've worked on it for like 10 years."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "It's a long time to work on something."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "And you suddenly can't see the faults in the thing that you're working on."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "And LLVM has lots of problems and we need to address them and we need to make it better."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "And if we don't make it better, then somebody else will come up with a better idea, right?"}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And so it's just kind of of that age where the community is like in danger of getting too calcified."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "And so I'm happy to see new projects joining and new things mixing it up."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Fortran is now a new thing in the LLVM community, which is hilarious and good."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I've been trying to find, on a little tangent, find people who program in Cobalt or Fortran, Fortran especially, to talk to, they're hard to find."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "Yeah, look to the scientific community."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "They still use Fortran quite a bit."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Well, interesting thing you kind of mentioned with LLVM, or just in general, that as something evolves, you're not able to see the faults."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "So do you fall in love with the thing over time?"}, {"time": 3923, "text": "Or do you start hating everything about the thing over time?"}, {"time": 3926, "text": "Well, so my personal folly is that I see, maybe not all, but many of the faults, and they grate on me, and I don't have time to go fix them."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "Yeah, and they get magnified over time."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "Well, and they may not get magnified, but they never get fixed."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And it's like sand underneath, you know, it's just like grating against you."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And it's like sand underneath your fingernails or something."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "It's just like, you know it's there, you can't get rid of it."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "And so the problem is that if other people don't see it, like I don't have time to go write the code and fix it anymore, but then people are resistant to change."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And so you say, hey, we should go fix this thing."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "They're like, oh yeah, that sounds risky."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "It's like, well, is it the right thing or not?"}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Are the challenges the group dynamics, or is it also just technical?"}, {"time": 3971, "text": "I mean, some of these features like, I think as an observer, it's almost like a fan in the, you know, as a spectator of the whole thing, I don't often think about, you know, some things might actually be technically difficult to implement."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "An example of this is we built this new compiler framework called MLIR."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "MLIR is a whole new framework."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "It's not, many people think it's about machine learning."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "The ML stands for multi level because compiler people can't name things very well, I guess."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "Do we dig into what MLIR is?"}, {"time": 4005, "text": "Yeah, so when you look at compilers, compilers have historically been solutions for a given space."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "So LLVM is a, it's really good for dealing with CPUs, let's just say, at a high level."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "You look at Java, Java has a JVM."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "The JVM is very good for garbage collected languages that need dynamic compilation, and it's very optimized for a specific space."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And so hotspot is one of the compilers that gets used in that space, and that compiler is really good at that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Usually when you build these domain specific compilers, you end up building the whole thing from scratch for each domain."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "What's a domain?"}, {"time": 4043, "text": "So what's the scope of a domain?"}, {"time": 4046, "text": "Well, so here I would say, like, if you look at Swift, there's several different parts to the Swift compiler, one of which is covered by the LLVM part of it."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "There's also a high level piece that's specific to Swift, and there's a huge amount of redundancy between those two different infrastructures and a lot of re implemented stuff that is similar but different."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "What does LLVM define?"}, {"time": 4069, "text": "LLVM is effectively an infrastructure."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "So you can mix and match it in different ways."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "It's built out of libraries."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "You can use it for different things, but it's really good at CPUs and GPUs."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "CPUs and like the tip of the iceberg on GPUs."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "It's not really great at GPUs."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "But it turns out."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "A bunch of languages that."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "That then use it to talk to CPUs."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And so it turns out there's a lot of hardware out there that is custom accelerators."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "So machine learning, for example."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "There are a lot of matrix multiply accelerators and things like this."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "There's a whole world of hardware synthesis."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So we're using MLIR to build circuits."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "And so you're compiling for a domain of transistors."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "And so what MLIR does is it provides a tremendous amount of compiler infrastructure that allows you to build these domain specific compilers in a much faster way and have the result be good."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "If we're thinking about the future, now we're talking about like ASICs."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "So anything."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "So if we project into the future, it's very possible that the number of these kinds of ASICs, very specific infrastructure architecture things like multiplies exponentially."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So that's MLIR."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "So what MLIR does is it allows you to build these compilers very efficiently."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "Right now, one of the things that coming back to the LLVM thing, and then we'll go to hardware, is LLVM is a specific compiler for a specific domain."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "MLIR is now this very general, very flexible thing that can solve lots of different kinds of problems."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "So LLVM is a subset of what MLIR does."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "So MLIR is, I mean, it's an ambitious project then."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "Yeah, it's a very ambitious project, yeah."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And so to make it even more confusing, MLIR has joined the LLVM Umbrella Project."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's part of the LLVM family."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "But where this comes full circle is now folks that work on the LLVM part, the classic part that's 20 years old, aren't aware of all the cool new things that have been done in the new thing, that MLIR was built by me and many other people that knew a lot about LLVM, and so we fixed a lot of the mistakes that lived in LLVM."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "And so now you have this community dynamic where it's like, well, there's this new thing, but it's not familiar, nobody knows it, it feels like it's new, and so let's not trust it."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And so it's just really interesting to see the cultural social dynamic that comes out of that."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And I think it's super healthy because we're seeing the ideas percolate and we're seeing the technology diffusion happen as people get more comfortable with it, they start to understand things in their own terms."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And this just gets to the, it takes a while for ideas to propagate, even though they may be very different than what people are used to."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "So maybe let's talk about that a little bit, the world of Asics."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "Actually, you have a new role at SciFive."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "What's that place about?"}, {"time": 4247, "text": "What is the vision for their vision for, I would say, the future of computer?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "Yeah, so I lead the engineering and product teams at SciFive."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "SciFive is a company who was founded with this architecture called RISC5."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "RISC5 is a new instruction set."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "Instruction sets are the things inside of your computer that tell it how to run things."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "X86 from Intel and ARM from the ARM company and things like this are other instruction sets."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "I've talked to, sorry to interrupt, I've talked to Dave Patterson, who's super excited about RISC5."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Dave is awesome."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "Yeah, he's brilliant, yeah."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "The RISC5 is distinguished by not being proprietary."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "And so X86 can only be made by Intel and AMD."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "ARM can only be made by ARM."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "They sell licenses to build ARM chips to other companies, things like this."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "MIPS is another instruction set that is owned by the MIPS company, now Wave."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And then it gets licensed out, things like that."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "And so RISC5 is an open standard that anybody can build chips for."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And so SciFive was founded by three of the founders of RISC5 that designed and built it in Berkeley, working with Dave."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "And so that was the genesis of the company."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "SciFive today has some of the world's best RISC5 cores and we're selling them and that's really great."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "They're going to tons of products, it's very exciting."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "So they're taking this thing that's open source and just trying to be or are the best in the world at building these things."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "Yeah, so here it's the specifications open source."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "It's like saying TCP IP is an open standard or C is an open standard, but then you have to build an implementation of the standard."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And so SciFive, on the one hand, pushes forward and defined and pushes forward the standard."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "On the other hand, we have implementations that are best in class for different points in the space, depending on if you want a really tiny CPU or if you want a really big, beefy one that is faster, but it uses more area and things like this."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "What about the actual manufacturer chips?"}, {"time": 4361, "text": "So like, where does that all fit?"}, {"time": 4363, "text": "I'm going to ask a bunch of dumb questions."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "That's okay, this is how we learn, right?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And so the way this works is that there's generally a separation of the people who designed the circuits and then people who manufacture them."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And so you'll hear about fabs like TSMC and Samsung and things like this that actually produce the chips, but they take a design coming in and that design specifies how the, you turn code for the chip into little rectangles that then use photolithography to make mask sets and then burn transistors onto a chip or onto a, onto silicon rather."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So, and we're talking about mass manufacturing, so."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Yeah, they're talking about making hundreds of millions of parts and things like that, yeah."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "And so the fab handles the volume production, things like that."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "But when you look at this problem, the interesting thing about the space when you look at it is that these, the steps that you go from designing a chip and writing the quote unquote code for it and things like Verilog and languages like that, down to what you hand off to the fab is a really well studied, really old problem, okay?"}, {"time": 4436, "text": "Tons of people have worked on it."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "Lots of smart people have built systems and tools."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "These tools then have generally gone through acquisitions."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "And so they've ended up at three different major companies that build and sell these tools."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "They're called the EDA tools like for electronic design automation."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "The problem with this is you have huge amounts of fragmentation, you have loose standards and the tools don't really work together."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "So you have tons of duct tape and you have tons of loss productivity."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "Now these are, these are tools for designing."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So the RISC 5 is a instruction."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "Like what is RISC 5?"}, {"time": 4472, "text": "Like how deep does it go?"}, {"time": 4473, "text": "How much does it touch the hardware?"}, {"time": 4475, "text": "How much does it define how much of the hardware is?"}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Yeah, so RISC 5 is all about given a CPU."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "So the processor and your computer, how does the compiler like Swift compiler, the C compiler, things like this, how does it make it work?"}, {"time": 4490, "text": "So it's, what is the assembly code?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so you write RISC 5 assembly instead of XA6 assembly, for example."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "But it's a set of instructions as opposed to instructions."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Why do you say it tells you how the compiler works?"}, {"time": 4503, "text": "Sorry, it's what the compiler talks to."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And then the tooling you mentioned that the disparate tools are for what?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "For when you're building a specific chip."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "So RISC 5."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "In hardware."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "In hardware, yeah."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "So RISC 5, you can buy a RISC 5 core from SciFive and say, hey, I want to have a certain number of, run a certain number of gigahertz."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "I want it to be this big."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "I want it to be, have these features."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "I want to have like, I want floating point or not, for example."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And then what you get is you get a description of a CPU with those characteristics."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Now, if you want to make a chip, you want to build like an iPhone chip or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 4541, "text": "You have to take both the CPU, but then you have to talk to memory."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "You have to have timers, IOs, a GPU, other components."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "And so you need to pull all those things together into what's called an ASIC, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "So a custom chip."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And then you take that design and then you have to transform it into something that the fabs, like TSMC, for example, know how to take to production."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So, but yeah, okay."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "And so that process, I will, I can't help but see it as, is a big compiler."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "It's a whole bunch of compilers written without thinking about it through that lens."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Isn't the universe a compiler?"}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Yeah, compilers do two things."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "They represent things and transform them."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "And so there's a lot of things that end up being compilers."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "But this is a space where we're talking about design and usability and the way you think about things, the way things compose correctly, it matters a lot."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And so SciFi is investing a lot into that space."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And we think that there's a lot of benefit that can be made by allowing people to design chips faster, get them to market quicker and scale out because at the alleged end of Moore's law, you've got this problem of you're not getting free performance just by waiting another year for a faster CPU."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And so you have to find performance in other ways."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And one of the ways to do that is with custom accelerators and other things and hardware."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And so, well, we'll talk a little more about ASICs, but do you see that a lot of people, a lot of companies will try to have different sets of requirements that this whole process to go for?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "So like almost different car companies might use different and like different PC manufacturers."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "So is RISC 5 in this whole process, is it potentially the future of all computing devices?"}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Yeah, I think that, so if you look at RISC 5 and step back from the Silicon side of things, RISC 5 is an open standard."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And one of the things that has happened over the course of decades, if you look over the long arc of computing, somehow became decades old."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "Is that you have companies that come and go and you have instruction sets that come and go."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "Like one example of this out of many is Sun with Spark."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "Yeah, it's on one way."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Spark still lives on at Fujitsu, but we have HP had this instruction set called PA RISC."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So PA RISC was this big server business and had tons of customers."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "They decided to move to this architecture called Itanium from Intel."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "This didn't work out so well."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Right, and so you have this issue of you're making many billion dollar investments on instruction sets that are owned by a company."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "And even companies as big as Intel don't always execute as well as they could."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "They even have their own issues."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "HP, for example, decided that it wasn't in their best interest to continue investing in the space because it was very expensive."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "And so they make technology decisions or they make their own business decisions."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And this means that as a customer, what do you do?"}, {"time": 4737, "text": "You've sunk all this time, all this engineering, all this software work, all these, you've built other products around them and now you're stuck, right?"}, {"time": 4745, "text": "What RISC 5 does is provide you more optionality in the space because if you buy an implementation of RISC 5 from SciFive, and you should, they're the best ones."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "But if something bad happens to SciFive in 20 years, right?"}, {"time": 4759, "text": "Well, great, you can turn around and buy a RISC 5 core from somebody else."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "And there's an ecosystem of people that are all making different RISC 5 cores with different trade offs, which means that if you have more than one requirement, if you have a family of products, you can probably find something in the RISC 5 space that fits your needs."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "Whereas with, if you're talking about XA6, for example, it's Intel's only gonna bother to make certain classes of devices, right?"}, {"time": 4785, "text": "I see, so maybe a weird question, but like if SciFive is like infinitely successful in the next 20, 30 years, what does the world look like?"}, {"time": 4798, "text": "So like how does the world of computing change?"}, {"time": 4801, "text": "So too much diversity in hardware instruction sets, I think is bad."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "Like we have a lot of people that are using lots of different instruction sets, particularly in the embedded, the like very tiny microcontroller space, the thing in your toaster that are just weird and different for historical reasons."}, {"time": 4821, "text": "And so the compilers and the tool chains and the languages on top of them aren't there."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "And so the developers for that software have to use really weird tools because the ecosystem that supports is not big enough."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So I expect that will change, right?"}, {"time": 4835, "text": "People will have better tools and better languages, better features everywhere that then can serve as many different points in the space."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And I think RISC5 will progressively eat more of the ecosystem because it can scale up, it can scale down, sideways, left, right."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "It's very flexible and very well considered and well designed instruction set."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "I think when you look at SciFive tackling silicon and how people build chips, which is a very different space, that's where you say, I think we'll see a lot more custom chips."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "And that means that you get much more battery life, you get better tuned solutions for your IoT thingy."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "You get people that move faster, you get the ability to have faster time to market, for example."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So how many custom..."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So first of all, on the IoT side of things, do you see the number of smart toasters increasing exponentially?"}, {"time": 4890, "text": "So, and if you do, like how much customization per toaster is there?"}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Do all toasters in the world run the same silicon, like the same design, or is it different companies have different design?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Like how much customization is possible here?"}, {"time": 4909, "text": "Well, a lot of it comes down to cost, right?"}, {"time": 4912, "text": "And so the way that chips work is you end up paying by the... One of the factors is the size of the chip."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "And so what ends up happening just from an economic perspective is there's only so many chips that get made in a year of a given design."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And so often what customers end up having to do is they end up having to pick up a chip that exists that was built for somebody else so that they can then ship their product."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "And the reason for that is they don't have the volume of the iPhone."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "They can't afford to build a custom chip."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "However, what that means is they're now buying an off the shelf chip that isn't really good, isn't a perfect fit for their needs."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And so they're paying a lot of money for it because they're buying silicon that they're not using."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "Well, if you now reduce the cost of designing the chip, now you get a lot more chips."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "And the more you reduce it, the easier it is to design chips."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "The more the world keeps evolving and we get more AI accelerators, we get more other things, we get more standards to talk to, we get 6G, right?"}, {"time": 4970, "text": "You get changes in the world that you wanna be able to talk to these different things."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "There's more diversity in the cross product of features that people want."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "And that drives differentiated chips in another direction."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "And so nobody really knows what the future looks like, but I think that there's a lot of silicon in the future."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Speaking of the future, you said Moore's law allegedly is dead."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "So do you agree with Dave Patterson and many folks that Moore's law is dead?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Or do you agree with Jim Keller, who's standing at the helm of the pirate ship saying it's still alive?"}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Well, so I agree with what they're saying and different people are interpreting the end of Moore's law in different ways."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "So Jim would say, there's another thousand X left in physics and we can continue to squeeze the stone and make it faster and smaller and smaller geometries and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "So Jim is absolutely right that there's a ton of progress left and we're not at the limit of physics yet."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "That's not really what Moore's law is though."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "If you look at what Moore's law is, is that it's a very simple evaluation of, okay, well you look at the cost per, I think it was cost per area and the most economic point in that space."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And if you go look at the now quite old paper that describes this, Moore's law has a specific economic aspect to it and I think this is something that Dave and others often point out."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "And so on a technicality, that's right."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "I look at it from, so I can acknowledge both of those viewpoints."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "They're both right."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "I'll give you a third wrong viewpoint that may be right in its own way, which is single threaded performance doesn't improve like it used to."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "And it used to be back when you got a, you know, a Pentium 66 or something and the year before you had a Pentium 33 and now it's twice as fast, right?"}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Well, it was twice as fast at doing exactly the same thing."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "Okay, like literally the same program ran twice as fast."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "You just wrote a check and waited a year, year and a half."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "Well, so that's what a lot of people think about Moore's law and I think that is dead."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "And so what we're seeing instead is we're pushing, we're pushing people to write software in different ways."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "And so we're pushing people to write CUDA so they can get GPU compute and the thousands of cores on GPU."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "We're talking about C programmers having to use P threads because they now have, you know, a hundred threads or 50 cores in a machine or something like that."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "You're now talking about machine learning accelerators that are now domain specific."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "And when you look at these kinds of use cases, you can still get performance and Jim will come up with cool things that utilize the silicon in new ways for sure, but you're also gonna change the programming model."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And now when you start talking about changing the programming model, that's when you come back to languages and things like this too, because often what you see is like you take the C programming language, right?"}, {"time": 5159, "text": "The C programming language is designed for CPUs."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "And so if you want to talk to a GPU, now you're talking to its cousin CUDA, okay?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "CUDA is a different thing with a different set of tools, a different world, a different way of thinking."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And we don't have one world that scales."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "And I think that we can get there."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "We can have one world that scales in a much better way."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "And a small tangent then, I think most programming languages are designed for CPUs, for single core, even just in their spirit, even if they allow for parallelization."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "So what does it look like for a programming language to have parallelization or massive parallelization as it's like first principle?"}, {"time": 5201, "text": "So the canonical example of this is the hardware design world."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So Verilog, VHDL, these kinds of languages, they're what's called a high level synthesis language."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "This is the thing people design chips in."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And when you're designing a chip, it's kind of like a brain where you have infinite parallelism."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Like you're like laying down transistors."}, {"time": 5225, "text": "Transistors are always running, okay?"}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And so you're not saying run this transistor, then this transistor, then this transistor."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "It's like your brain, like your neurons are always just doing something."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "They're not clocked, right?"}, {"time": 5236, "text": "They're just doing their thing."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "And so when you design a chip or when you design a CPU, when you design a GPU, when you design, when you're laying down the transistors, similarly, you're talking about, well, okay, well, how do these things communicate?"}, {"time": 5251, "text": "And so these languages exist."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "Verilog is a kind of mixed example of that."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "None of these languages are really great."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "You have a very low level, yeah."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "Yeah, they're very low level and abstraction is necessary here."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And there's different approaches with that."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "And it's itself a very complicated world, but it's implicitly parallel."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "And so having that as the domain that you program towards makes it so that by default, you get parallel systems."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "If you look at CUDA, CUDA is a point halfway in the space where in CUDA, when you write a CUDA kernel for your GPU, it feels like you're writing a scalar program."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "So you're like, you have ifs, you have for loops, stuff like this, you're just writing normal code."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "But what happens outside of that in your driver is that it actually is running you on like a thousand things at once, right?"}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And so it's parallel, but it has pulled it out of the programming model."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "And so now you as a programmer are working in a simpler world and it's solved that for you, right?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "How do you take the language like Swift?"}, {"time": 5316, "text": "If we think about GPUs, but also ASICs, maybe if we can dance back and forth between hardware and software."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "How do you design for these features to be able to program and get a first class citizen to be able to do like Swift for TensorFlow to be able to do machine learning on current hardware, but also future hardware like TPUs and all kinds of ASICs that I'm sure will be popping up more and more."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "Yeah, well, so a lot of this comes down to this whole idea of having the nuts and bolts underneath the covers that work really well."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "So you need, if you're talking to TPUs, you need MLIR or XLA or one of these compilers that talks to TPUs to build on top of, okay?"}, {"time": 5357, "text": "And if you're talking to circuits, you need to figure out how to lay down the transistors and how to organize it and how to set up clocking and like all the domain problems that you get with circuits."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "Then you have to decide how to explain it to a human."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "What is ZY, right?"}, {"time": 5371, "text": "And if you do it right, that's a library problem, not a language problem."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "And that works if you have a library or a language which allows your library to write things that feel native in the language by implementing libraries, because then you can innovate in programming models without having to change your syntax again."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "Like you have to invent new code formatting tools and like all the other things that languages come with."}, {"time": 5397, "text": "And this gets really interesting."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And so if you look at the space, the interesting thing once you separate out syntax becomes what is that programming model?"}, {"time": 5407, "text": "And so do you want the CUDA style?"}, {"time": 5410, "text": "I write one program and it runs many places."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Do you want the implicitly parallel model?"}, {"time": 5416, "text": "How do you reason about that?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "How do you give developers, chip architects, the ability to express their intent?"}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And that comes into this whole design question of how do you detect bugs quickly?"}, {"time": 5429, "text": "So you don't have to tape out a chip to find out it's wrong, ideally, right?"}, {"time": 5432, "text": "How do you, and this is a spectrum, how do you make it so that people feel productive?"}, {"time": 5438, "text": "So their turnaround time is very quick."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "All these things are really hard problems."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And in this world, I think that not a lot of effort has been put into that design problem and thinking about the layering in other pieces."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "Well, you've, on the topic of concurrency, you've written the Swift concurrency manifest."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "I think it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "Anything that has the word manifest on it is very interesting."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "Can you summarize the key ideas of each of the five parts you've written about?"}, {"time": 5467, "text": "So what is a manifesto?"}, {"time": 5469, "text": "How about, we start there."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "So in the Swift community, we have this problem, which is on the one hand, you wanna have relatively small proposals that you can kind of fit in your head, you can understand the details at a very fine grain level that move the world forward."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "But then you also have these big arcs, okay?"}, {"time": 5488, "text": "And often when you're working on something that is a big arc, but you're tackling it in small pieces, you have this question of, how do I know I'm not doing a random walk?"}, {"time": 5497, "text": "Where are we going?"}, {"time": 5498, "text": "How does this add up?"}, {"time": 5499, "text": "Furthermore, when you start the first small step, what terminology do you use?"}, {"time": 5506, "text": "What is better and worse in the space?"}, {"time": 5508, "text": "What are we trying to achieve?"}, {"time": 5510, "text": "And so what a manifesto in the Swift community does is it starts to say, hey, well, let's step back from the details of everything."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "Let's paint a broad picture to talk about what we're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Let's give an example design point."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Let's try to paint the big picture so that then we can zero in on the individual steps and make sure that we're making good progress."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "And so the Swift concurrency manifesto is something I wrote three years ago."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "It's been a while, maybe more."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Trying to do that for Swift and concurrency."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It starts with some fairly simple things like making the observation that when you have multiple different computers and multiple different threads that are communicating, it's best for them to be asynchronous."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "And so you need things to be able to run separately and then communicate with each other."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "And this means asynchrony."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "And this means that you need a way to modeling asynchronous communication."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "Many languages have features like this."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "Async await is a popular one."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "And so that's what I think is very likely in Swift."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "But as you start building this tower of abstractions, it's not just about how do you write this, you then reach into the how do you get memory safety because you want correctness, you want debuggability and sanity for developers."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And how do you get that memory safety into the language?"}, {"time": 5586, "text": "So if you take a language like Go or C or any of these languages, you get what's called a race condition when two different threads or Go routines or whatever touch the same point in memory, right?"}, {"time": 5597, "text": "This is a huge like maddening problem to debug because it's not reproducible generally."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "And so there's tools, there's a whole ecosystem of solutions that built up around this, but it's a huge problem when you're writing concurrent code."}, {"time": 5611, "text": "And so with Swift, this whole value semantics thing is really powerful there because it turns out that math and copies actually work even in concurrent worlds."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "And so you get a lot of safety just out of the box, but there are also some hard problems."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And it talks about some of that."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "When you start building up to the next level up and you start talking beyond memory safety, you have to talk about what is the programmer model?"}, {"time": 5633, "text": "How does a human think about this?"}, {"time": 5634, "text": "So a developer that's trying to build a program think about this, and it proposes a really old model with a new spin called Actors."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "Actors are about saying, we have islands of single threadedness logically."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "So you write something that feels like it's one program running in a unit, and then it communicates asynchronously with other things."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And so making that expressive and natural feel good be the first thing you reach for and being safe by default is a big part of the design of that proposal."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "When you start going beyond that, now you start to say, cool, well, these things that communicate asynchronously, they don't have to share memory."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "Well, if they don't have to share memory and they're sending messages to each other, why do they have to be in the same process?"}, {"time": 5678, "text": "These things should be able to be in different processes on your machine."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "And why just processes?"}, {"time": 5683, "text": "Well, why not different machines?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And so now you have a very nice gradual transition towards distributed programming."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "And of course, when you start talking about the big future, the manifesto doesn't go into it, but accelerators are things you talk to asynchronously by sending messages to them."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "And how do you program those?"}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Well, that gets very interesting."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "That's not in the proposal."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And how much do you wanna make that explicit like the control of that whole process explicit to the program?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So when you're designing any of these kinds of features or language features or even libraries, you have this really hard trade off you have to make, which is how much is it magic or how much is it in the human's control?"}, {"time": 5729, "text": "How much can they predict and control it?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "What do you do when the default case is the wrong case?"}, {"time": 5737, "text": "And so when you're designing a system, and so when you're designing a system, I won't name names, but there are systems where it's really easy to get started and then you jump."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "So let's pick like logo."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "Okay, so something like this."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "So it's really easy to get started."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "It's really designed for teaching kids, but as you get into it, you hit a ceiling and then you can't go any higher."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "And then what do you do?"}, {"time": 5764, "text": "Well, you have to go switch to a different world and rewrite all your code."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "And this logo is a silly example here."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "This exists in many other languages."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "With Python, you would say like concurrency, right?"}, {"time": 5775, "text": "So Python has the global interpreter block."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "So threading is challenging in Python."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "And so if you start writing a large scale application in Python, and then suddenly you need concurrency, you're kind of stuck with a series of bad trade offs, right?"}, {"time": 5790, "text": "There's other ways to go where you say like, foist all the complexity on the user all at once, right?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And that's also bad in a different way."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "And so what I prefer is building a simple model that you can explain that then has an escape hatch."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "So you get in, you have guardrails, memory safety works like this in Swift, where you can start with, like by default, if you use all the standard things, it's memory safe, you're not gonna shoot your foot off."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "But if you wanna get a C level pointer to something, you can explicitly do that."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "But by default, there's guardrails."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "There's guardrails."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Okay, so but like, whose job is it to figure out which part of the code is parallelizable?"}, {"time": 5837, "text": "So in the case of the proposal, it is the human's job."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "So they decide how to architect their application."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "And then the runtime in the compiler is very predictable."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And so this is in contrast to like, there's a long body of work, including on Fortran for auto parallelizing compilers."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And this is an example of a bad thing in my, so as a compiler person, I can drag on compiler people."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "Often compiler people will say, cool, since I can't change the code, I'm gonna write my compiler that then takes this unmodified code and makes go way faster on this machine."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "Okay, application, and so it does pattern matching."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "It does like really deep analysis."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "Compiler people are really smart."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "And so they like wanna like do something really clever and tricky."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And you get like 10X speed up by taking like an array of structures and turn it into a structure of arrays or something, because it's so much better for memory."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "Like there's bodies, like tons of tricks."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "They love optimization."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "Yeah, you love optimization."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "Everyone loves optimization."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "Everyone loves it."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Well, and it's this promise of build with my compiler and your thing goes fast, right?"}, {"time": 5900, "text": "But here's the problem, Lex, you write a program, you run it with my compiler, it goes fast."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "You're very happy."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "Wow, it's so much faster than the other compiler."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "Then you go and you add a feature to your program or you refactor some code."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "And suddenly you got a 10X loss in performance."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "What just happened there?"}, {"time": 5917, "text": "What just happened there is the heuristic, the pattern matching, the compiler, whatever analysis it was doing just got defeated because you didn't inline a function or something, right?"}, {"time": 5928, "text": "As a user, you don't know, you don't wanna know."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "That was the whole point."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "You don't wanna know how the compiler works."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "You don't wanna know how the memory hierarchy works."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "You don't wanna know how it got parallelized across all these things."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "You wanted that abstracted away from you, but then the magic is lost as soon as you did something and you fall off a performance cliff."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "And now you're in this funny position where what do I do?"}, {"time": 5948, "text": "I don't change my code."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "I don't fix that bug."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "It costs 10X performance."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "Now what do I do?"}, {"time": 5953, "text": "Well, this is the problem with unpredictable performance."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "If you care about performance, predictability is a very important thing."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And so what the proposal does is it provides architectural patterns for being able to lay out your code, gives you full control over that, makes it really simple so you can explain it."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "And then if you wanna scale out in different ways, you have full control over that."}, {"time": 5976, "text": "So in your sense, the intuition is for a compiler, it's too hard to do automated parallelization."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "Cause the compilers do stuff automatically that's incredibly impressive for other things, but for parallelization, we're not close to there."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "Well, it depends on the programming model."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "So there's many different kinds of compilers."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "And so if you talk about like a C compiler or Swift compiler or something like that, where you're writing imperative code, parallelizing that and reasoning about all the pointers and stuff like that is a very difficult problem."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Now, if you switch domains, so there's this cool thing called machine learning, right?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "So machine learning nerds among other endearing things like solving cat detectors and other things like that have done this amazing breakthrough of producing a programming model, operations that you compose together that has raised levels of abstraction high enough that suddenly you can have auto parallelizing compilers."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "You can write a model using a TensorFlow and have it run on 1024 nodes of a TPU."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "I didn't even think about like, cause there's so much flexibility in the design of architectures that ultimately boil down to a graph that's parallelized for you."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "And if you think about it, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "That's pretty cool, yeah."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "And you think about batching, for example, as a way of being able to exploit more parallelism."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Like that's a very simple thing that now is very powerful."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "That didn't come out of the programming language nerds, those people, like that came out of people that are just looking to solve a problem and use a few GPUs and organically developed by the community of people focusing on machine learning."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And it's an incredibly powerful abstraction layer that enables the compiler people to go and exploit that."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "And now you can drive supercomputers from Python."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "Well, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "So just to pause on that, cause I'm not sufficiently low level, I forget to admire the beauty and power of that, but maybe just to linger on it, like what does it take to run a neural network fast?"}, {"time": 6102, "text": "Like how hard is that compilation?"}, {"time": 6105, "text": "So we just skipped, you said like, it's amazing that that's a thing, but yeah, how hard is that of a thing?"}, {"time": 6111, "text": "It's hard and I would say that not all of the systems are really great, including the ones I helped build."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "So there's a lot of work left to be done there."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Is it the compiler nerds working on that or is it a whole new group of people?"}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Well, it's a full stack problem, including compiler people, including APIs, so like Keras and the module API and PyTorch and Jax."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "And there's a bunch of people pushing on all the different parts of these things, because when you look at it as it's both, how do I express the computation?"}, {"time": 6141, "text": "Do I stack up layers?"}, {"time": 6142, "text": "Well, cool, like setting up a linear sequence of layers is great for the simple case, but how do I do the hard case?"}, {"time": 6148, "text": "How do I do reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 6149, "text": "Well, now I need to integrate my application logic in this."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "Then it's the next level down of, how do you represent that for the runtime?"}, {"time": 6156, "text": "How do you get hardware abstraction?"}, {"time": 6159, "text": "And then you get to the next level down of saying like, forget about abstraction, how do I get the peak performance out of my TPU or my iPhone accelerator or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 6167, "text": "And all these different things."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And so this is a layered problem with a lot of really interesting design and work going on in the space and a lot of really smart people working on it."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "Machine learning is a very well funded area of investment right now."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And so there's a lot of progress being made."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "So how much innovation is there on the lower level, so closer to the ASIC, so redesigning the hardware or redesigning concurrently compilers with that hardware?"}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Is that like, if you were to predict the biggest, the equivalent of Moore's law improvements in the inference and the training of neural networks and just all of that, where is that gonna come from, you think?"}, {"time": 6206, "text": "Sure, you get scalability of different things."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And so you get Jim Keller shrinking process technology, you get three nanometer instead of five or seven or 10 or 28 or whatever."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And so that marches forward and that provides improvements."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "You get architectural level performance."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "And so the TPU with a matrix multiply unit and a systolic array is much more efficient than having a scalar core doing multiplies and adds and things like that."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "You then get system level improvements."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "So how you talk to memory, how you talk across a cluster of machines, how you scale out, how you have fast interconnects between machines."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "You then get system level programming models."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "So now that you have all this hardware, how to utilize it."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "You then have algorithmic breakthroughs where you say, hey, wow, cool."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "Instead of training in a resonant 50 in a week, I'm now training it in 25 seconds."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "And it's a combination of new optimizers and new just training regimens and different approaches to train."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And all of these things come together to push the world forward."}, {"time": 6276, "text": "That was a beautiful exposition."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "But if you were to force to bet all your money on one of these."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "Why do we have to?"}, {"time": 6288, "text": "Unfortunately, we have people working on all this."}, {"time": 6290, "text": "It's an exciting time, right?"}, {"time": 6292, "text": "So, I mean, OpenAI did this little paper showing the algorithmic improvement you can get."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "It's been improving exponentially."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "I haven't quite seen the same kind of analysis on other layers of the stack."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "I'm sure it's also improving significantly."}, {"time": 6309, "text": "I just, it's a nice intuition builder."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "I mean, there's a reason why Moore's Law, that's the beauty of Moore's Law is somebody writes a paper that makes a ridiculous prediction."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And it becomes reality in a sense."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "There's something about these narratives when you, when Chris Ladner on a silly little podcast makes, bets all his money on a particular thing, somehow it can have a ripple effect of actually becoming real."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "That's an interesting aspect of it."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "Cause like it might've been, we focus with Moore's Law, most of the computing industry really, really focused on the hardware."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "I mean, software innovation, I don't know how much software innovation there was in terms of efficient."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "What Intel Giveth Bill takes away, right?"}, {"time": 6360, "text": "Yeah, I mean, compilers improved significantly also."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "Well, not really."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "So actually, I mean, so I'm joking about how software has gotten slower pretty much as fast as hardware got better, at least through the nineties."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "There's another joke, another law in compilers, which is called, I think it's called Probstine's Law, which is compilers double the performance of any given code every 18 years."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "So they move slowly."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "Yeah, also."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "Well, yeah, it's exponential also."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "Yeah, you're making progress, but there again, it's not about, the power of compilers is not just about how do you make the same thing go faster?"}, {"time": 6399, "text": "It's how do you unlock the new hardware?"}, {"time": 6401, "text": "A new chip came out, how do you utilize it?"}, {"time": 6403, "text": "You say, oh, the programming model, how do we make people more productive?"}, {"time": 6406, "text": "How do we have better error messages?"}, {"time": 6411, "text": "Even such mundane things like how do I generate a very specific error message about your code actually makes people happy because then they know how to fix it, right?"}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it comes back to how do you help people get their job done."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "Yeah, and yeah, and then in this world of exponentially increasing smart toasters, how do you expand computing to all these kinds of devices?"}, {"time": 6436, "text": "Do you see this world where just everything is a computing surface?"}, {"time": 6440, "text": "You see that possibility?"}, {"time": 6442, "text": "Just everything is a computer?"}, {"time": 6443, "text": "Yeah, I don't see any reason that that couldn't be achieved."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "It turns out that sand goes into glass and glass is pretty useful too."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And why not?"}, {"time": 6455, "text": "So very important question then, if we're living in a simulation and the simulation is running a computer, like what's the architecture of that computer, do you think?"}, {"time": 6471, "text": "So you're saying is it a quantum system?"}, {"time": 6474, "text": "Yeah, like this whole quantum discussion, is it needed?"}, {"time": 6477, "text": "Or can we run it with a RISC 5 architecture, a bunch of CPUs?"}, {"time": 6485, "text": "I think it comes down to the right tool for the job."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "Yeah, and so."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "And what's the compiler?"}, {"time": 6490, "text": "Yeah, exactly, that's my question."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "Did I get that job?"}, {"time": 6493, "text": "Feed the universe compiler."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "And so there, as far as we know, quantum systems are the bottom of the pile of turtles so far."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "And so we don't know efficient ways to implement quantum systems without using quantum computers."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "Yeah, and that's totally outside of everything we've talked about."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But who runs that quantum computer?"}, {"time": 6517, "text": "Right, so if we really are living in a simulation, then is it bigger quantum computers?"}, {"time": 6524, "text": "Is it different ones?"}, {"time": 6525, "text": "Like how does that work out?"}, {"time": 6526, "text": "How does that scale?"}, {"time": 6527, "text": "Well, it's the same size."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "It's the same size."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "But then the thought of the simulation is that you don't have to run the whole thing, that we humans are cognitively very limited."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "We do checkpoints."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "We do checkpoints, yeah."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "And if we, the point at which we human, so you basically do minimal amount of, what is it, Swift does on right, copy on right."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "So you only adjust the simulation."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "Parallel universe theories, right?"}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And so every time a decision's made, somebody opens the short end of your box, then there's a fork."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "And then this could happen."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And then, thank you for considering the possibility."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "But yeah, so it may not require the entirety of the universe to simulate it."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "But it's interesting to think about as we create this higher and higher fidelity systems."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "But I do wanna ask on the quantum computer side, because everything we've talked about, whether you work with SciFive, with compilers, none of that includes quantum computers, right?"}, {"time": 6595, "text": "So have you ever thought about this whole serious engineering work of quantum computers looks like of compilers, of architectures, all of that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 6610, "text": "So I've looked at it a little bit."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "I know almost nothing about it, which means that at some point, I will have to find an excuse to get involved, because that's how it works."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "But do you think that's a thing to be, like with your little tingly senses of the timing of when to be involved, is it not yet?"}, {"time": 6626, "text": "Well, so the thing I do really well is I jump into messy systems and figure out how to make them, figure out what the truth in the situation is, try to figure out what the unifying theory is, how to like factor the complexity, how to find a beautiful answer to a problem that has been well studied and lots of people have bashed their heads against it."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "I don't know that quantum computers are mature enough and accessible enough to be figured out yet, right?"}, {"time": 6653, "text": "And I think the open question with quantum computers is, is there a useful problem that gets solved with a quantum computer that makes it worth the economic cost of like having one of these things and having legions of people that set it up?"}, {"time": 6671, "text": "You go back to the fifties, right?"}, {"time": 6672, "text": "And there's the projections of the world will only need seven computers, right?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Well, and part of that was that people hadn't figured out what they're useful for."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "What are the algorithms we wanna run?"}, {"time": 6683, "text": "What are the problems that get solved?"}, {"time": 6684, "text": "And this comes back to how do we make the world better, either economically or making somebody's life better or like solving a problem that wasn't solved before, things like this."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "And I think that just we're a little bit too early in that development cycle because it's still like literally a science project, not a negative connotation, right?"}, {"time": 6701, "text": "It's literally a science project and the progress there is amazing."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And so I don't know if it's 10 years away, if it's two years away, exactly where that breakthrough happens, but you look at machine learning, we went through a few winners before the AlexNet transition and then suddenly it had its breakout moment."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And that was the catalyst that then drove the talent flocking into it."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "That's what drove the economic applications of it."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "That's what drove the technology to go faster because you now have more minds thrown at the problem."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "This is what caused like a serious knee in deep learning and the algorithms that we're using."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "And so I think that's what quantum needs to go through."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "And so right now it's in that formidable finding itself, getting the like literally the physics figured out."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "And then it has to figure out the application that makes this useful."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "Yeah, but I'm not skeptical that I think that will happen."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "I think it's just 10 years away, something like that."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "I forgot to ask, what programming language do you think the simulation is written in?"}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Ooh, probably Lisp."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "So not Swift."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Like if you're a Tibet, I'll just leave it at that."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So, I mean, we've mentioned that you worked with all these companies, we've talked about all these projects."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "It's kind of like if we just step back and zoom out about the way you did that work."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "And we look at COVID times, this pandemic we're living through that may, if I look at the way Silicon Valley folks are talking about it, the way MIT is talking about it, this might last for a long time."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Not just the virus, but the remote nature."}, {"time": 6808, "text": "The economic impact."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "I mean, all of it, yeah."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "Yeah, it's gonna be a mess."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "Do you think, what's your prediction?"}, {"time": 6814, "text": "I mean, from sci fi to Google, to just all the places you worked in, just Silicon Valley, you're in the middle of it."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "What do you think is, how is this whole place gonna change?"}, {"time": 6826, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, I really can only speak to the tech perspective."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "I am in that bubble."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "I think it's gonna be really interesting because the Zoom culture of being remote and on video chat all the time has really interesting effects on people."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "So on the one hand, it's a great normalizer."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "It's a normalizer that I think will help communities of people that have traditionally been underrepresented because now you're taking, in some cases, a face off because you don't have to have a camera going, right?"}, {"time": 6858, "text": "And so you can have conversations without physical appearance being part

years, a hundred years from now, how do we evaluate the decisions are being made right now?"}, {"time": 7566, "text": "I think that's really the way you can frame that and look at it."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And you say, you know, you integrate across all the short term horribleness that's happening and you look at what that means and is the improvement across the world or the regression across the world significant enough to make it a good or a bad thing?"}, {"time": 7584, "text": "I think that's the question."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "And for that, it's good to study history."},

it's everything is just, I just see parallels and it means it's, you have to be really careful not to overstep it, but just the thing that worries me the most is the pain that people feel when a few things combine, which is like economic depression, which is quite possible in this country."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "And then just being disrespected in some kind of way, which the German people

make a decision where you're predicting the future based on what you've seen in the recent past."}, {"time": 7684, "text": "And so if something's always been, it's rained every single day, then of

history for this."}, {"time": 7704, "text": "Like what is the catalyst that led to that explosion that led to that bill that led to the, like you can kind of work your way backwards from that."},

a longterm optimist on pretty much everything and human nature."}, {"time": 7739, "text": "We can look to all the negative things that humanity has, all the pettiness and all the like self servingness

gonna happen in this 100 years."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "It's scary, like exciting."}, {"time": 7779, "text": "Like scary in a sense that it's kind of sad that the kind of technology is gonna come out in 10, 20, 30 years."}, {"time": 7785, "text": "We're probably too old to really appreciate if you don't grow up with it."}, {"time": 7789, "text": "It'll be like kids these days with their virtual reality and their TikToks and stuff like this."}, {"time": 7794, "text": "Like, how does this thing and like, come on, give me my static photo."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "My Commodore 64."},

computation actually, is of language models that are huge and take many, many computers, not just to train, but to also do inference on."}, {"time": 7840, "text": "Well, I mean, it depends on what you're speaking to there."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "But I mean, I think that there's been a pretty well understood maximum in deep learning that if you make the model bigger and you shove more data into it, assuming you train it right and you have a good model architecture, that you'll get a better model out."}, {"time": 7855, "text": "And so on one hand, GPT3 was not that surprising."},

"I think that when GPT2 came out, there was a very provocative blog post from OpenAI talking about, we're not gonna release it because of the social damage it could cause if it's misused."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "I think that's still a concern."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "I think that we need to look at how technology is applied and well meaning tools can be applied in very horrible ways and they can have very profound impact on that."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "I think that GPT3 is a huge technical achievement."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "And what will GPT4 be?"}, {"time": 7895, "text": "Well, it'll probably be bigger, more expensive to train."}, {"time": 7898, "text": "Really cool architectural tricks."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "What do you think, is there, I don't know how much thought you've done on distributed computing."}, {"time": 7908, "text": "Is there some technical challenges that are interesting that you're hopeful about exploring in terms of a system that, like a piece of code that with GPT4 that might have, I don't know, hundreds of trillions of parameters which have to run on thousands of computers."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "Is there some hope that we can make that happen?"}, {"time": 7935, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, today you can write a check and get access to a thousand TPU cores and do really interesting large scale training and inference and things like that in Google Cloud, for example, right?"}, {"time": 7947, "text": "And so I don't think it's a question about scale, it's a question about utility."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "And when I look at the transformer series of architectures that the GPT series is based on, it's really interesting to look at that because they're actually very simple designs."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "They're not recurrent."}, {"time": 7964, "text": "The training regimens are pretty simple."}, {"time": 7967, "text": "And so they don't really reflect like human brains, right?"}, {"time": 7971, "text": "But they're really good at learning language models and they're unrolled enough that you can simulate some recurrence, right?"}, {"time": 7979, "text": "And so the question I think about is, where does this take us?"}, {"time": 7983, "text": "Like, so we can just keep scaling it, have more parameters, more data, more things, we'll get a better result for sure."}, {"time": 7989, "text": "But are there architectural techniques that can lead to progress at a faster pace, right?"}, {"time": 7995, "text": "This is when, you know, how do you get, instead of just like making it a constant time bigger, how do you get like an algorithmic improvement out of this, right?"}, {"time": 8004, "text": "And whether it be a new training regimen, if it becomes sparse networks, for example, the human brain is sparse, all these networks are dense."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "The connectivity patterns can be very different."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "I think this is where I get very interested and

networks, one of the things that Jeff Dean likes to talk about and he's given a few talks on is this idea of having a sparsely gated mixture of experts kind of a model where you have, you know, different nets that are trained and are really good at certain kinds of tasks."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "And so you have this distributor across a cluster and so you have a lot of different computers that end up being kind of locally specialized in different demands."}, {"time": 8049, "text": "And then when a query comes in, you gate it and you use learn techniques to route to different parts of the network."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And then you utilize the compute resources of the entire cluster by having specialization within it."}, {"time": 8060, "text": "And I don't know where that goes or when it starts to work, but I think things like that could be really interesting as well."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "And on the data side too, if you can think of data selection as a kind of programming."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "I mean, essentially, if you look at it, like Karpathy talked about software 2.0, I mean, in a sense, data is the program."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "So let me try to summarize Andre's position really quick before I disagree with it."}, {"time": 8091, "text": "So Andre Karpathy is amazing."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "So this is nothing personal with him."},

"text": "You know, he's just an amazing person."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "He's also really sweet."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "So his basic premise is that software is suboptimal."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "I think we can all agree to that."}, {"time": 8111, "text": "He also points out that deep learning and other learning based techniques are really great because you can solve problems in more structured ways with less like ad hoc code that people write out and don't write test cases for in some cases."}, {"time": 8125, "text": "And so they don't even know if it works in the first place."},

programming paradigms, when you look across demands, is structured programming where you go from go tos to if, then, else, or functional programming from Lisp."}, {"time": 8202, "text": "And you start talking about higher order functions and values and things like this."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "Or you talk about object oriented programming."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "You're talking about

the other scenario it is that you're working in."}, {"time": 8462, "text": "You have to combine that thing with the robot control for the arm, right?"}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And so now it's not just about that one paradigm, it's about integrating that with all the other systems that you have, including often legacy systems and things like this, right?"}, {"time": 8478, "text": "And so to me, I think that the interesting thing to say is like, how do you get the best out of this domain and how do you enable people to achieve things that they otherwise couldn't do without excluding all the good things we already know how to do?"}, {"time": 8491, "text": "Right, but okay, this is a crazy question, but we talked a little bit about GPT3, but do you think it's possible that these language models that in essence, in the language domain, Software 2.0 could replace some aspect of compilation, for example, or do program synthesis, replace some aspect of programming?"}, {"time": 8517, "text": "So I think that learned models in general are extremely powerful, and I think that people underestimate them."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "Maybe you can suggest what I should do."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "So if I have access to the GPT3 API, would I be able to generate Swift code, for example?"}, {"time": 8534, "text": "Do you think that could do something interesting and would work?"},

want filled in?"}, {"time": 8564, "text": "You can definitely write scaffolding of code and say, fill in the hole, and sort of put in some for loops, or put in some classes or whatever."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "And the power of these models is impressive, but there's an unsolved question, at least unsolved to me, which is, how do I express the intent of what to fill in?"}, {"time": 8581,

end."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "And the assertions always pass."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "And so you want a generative model on the one hand, yes."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "Oh, that's fascinating, yeah."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "Right, but you also want some loop back, some reinforcement learning system or something, where you're actually saying like, I need to hill climb towards something that is more correct."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "And I don't know that we have that."}, {"time": 8609, "text": "So it would generate not only a bunch of the code, but like the checks that do the testing."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "It would generate the tests."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "I think the humans would generate the tests, right?"}, {"time": 8619, "text": "But it would be fascinating

photograph."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "I'm like, yeah, but it's the only one that I had that was like, where my hair was kind of similar to what it is now, and he's like, Lisa, like, do I have to

to pick up the person I'm gonna marry."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I mean, like, I really, but I really, you know, like, our conversations were just very authentic and very moving and we really connected."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And I really felt like he understood me, actually, in a way that a lot of people don't."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And what was really nice was, at the time, you know, the airport was this tiny little airport out in a cornfield, basically."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And so driving back to the town, we were in the car for 15 minutes, completely in the dark, as I was driving."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And so it was very similar to, we had just spent, you know, 20 something hours on the telephone, sitting in the dark, talking to each other."}, {"time": 1151,

end of the weekend, I said, okay, you know, if we're gonna give this a shot, we probably shouldn't see other people."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So it's a risk, you know?"}, {"time": 1175, "text":

these conversations actually from the, really from the second weekend we were together."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "So he flew back the next weekend to State College because it was my birthday."},

sitting on a cliff over this overlook and talking to each other."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "And I was thinking, and I actually said to him, like I haven't really known you very long, but I feel like I'm falling in love with you, which can't possibly be happening."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I must be projecting, but it certainly feels that way."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Like I don't believe in love at first sight."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So this can't really be happening, but it sort of feels like it is."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And he was like, I know what you mean."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And so for the first three months or four months, we would say things to each other."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Like, I feel like I'm in love with you, but you know, but that can't, but things don't really work like that."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "So, but you know, so, and then it became a joke."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Like I feel like I'm in love with you."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And then eventually, you know, I think, but I think that was one moment where we were talking about just, you know, not just all the great aspirations you have or all the things, but also things you don't like about yourself, things that you're worried about, things that you're scared of."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And then I think that was sort of solidified the relationship."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "And then there was one weekend where we went to Maine in the winter, which I mean, I really love the beach always, but in the winter, particularly."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "Because it's just beautiful and calm and whatever."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And I also, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Like, so there's this grand majestic scene of, you know, this very powerful ocean and it's all these like beautiful blue grays and it's just stunning."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And so we were sitting on this huge rock in Maine and where we'd gone for the weekend, it was freezing cold."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And I honestly can't remember what he said or what I said or what, but I definitely remember having this feeling of, I absolutely wanna stay with this person."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And I don't know what my life will be like if I'm not with this person."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "Like I need to be with this person."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Can we, from a scientific and a human perspective, dig into your belief that first love at first sight is not possible?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "You don't believe in it?"}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Cause there is, you don't think there's like a magic where you see somebody in the Jack Kerouac way and you're like, wow, that's something."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "That's a special little glimmer or something."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Oh, I definitely think you can connect with someone instant, in an instance."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And I definitely think

engineering room."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Think from first principles, how do we build the thing that creates this kind of behavior?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "And then you go into the romantic

on the conversation that led up to that point."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "Depends how much, it's like the music, because you have a very, you're both from the, my experiences with you as a fan, you have both a romantic niche, but you have a very pragmatic, like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And there's something about a six way plug that cuts through

not bothered by snow."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "Well, I mean, I'm a little bothered by snow, but he's very bothered by snow."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "So I'm like, okay, you can park your car in the

to detail."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "He doesn't fuss about detail, but he definitely pays attention to detail."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And it is very, very romantic in the sense that he loves me

maybe one way I could ask before we talk about the details, you also have the author of another book as we talked about how emotions are made."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So it's interesting to talk about the process of writing."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "You mentioned you were in New York."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "What have you learned from writing these two books about the actual process of writing?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And maybe, I don't know what's the most interesting thing to talk about there."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "Maybe the biggest challenges or the boring, mundane,

the thing I learned."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "If you think that it's gonna take you a year to write your book, it's going to take you three years to write your book."}, {"time": 2355, "text":

it."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "Some of the topics really take on a life of their own and to some extent you wanna let them have their voice."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "You wanna follow leads until you

the eight ball in terms of time."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "But it is the exploration and the foraging for information is incredibly fun."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "For me anyways, I found it really enjoyable."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "And if I wasn't also running a lab at the same time and trying to keep my family going, the whole thing would have just been fun."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "But I would say the hardest thing about, the most important thing I think I learned is also the hardest thing and that for me, which is knowing what to leave out."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "A really good

notes is attached to a web note, which is also long."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "So I mean, it's, and it start, and I mean the final draft, I mean, I wrote three drafts of that book actually."},

down to like 110."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "So obviously it's, I struggle with what to leave out."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Brevity is not my strong suit."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "I'm always telling people that it's a warning."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So that's why this book was, I'd always been really fascinated with essays."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "I love reading essays."}, {"time":

essays?"}, {"time": 2532, "text": "They are, they're called familiar essays."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So the topics are like everyday topics, like mail, coffee, chocolate."}, {"time": 2542, "text":

book."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And how did you learn to write essays like this?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "And she gave me a reading list of essays that I should read like writers."}, {"time": 2607,

violating the validity of the science."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "That was a, I just set myself this, what I thought of as a really, really big challenge in part because it was an incredibly hard

embodies brevity, right?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "The whole point throughout is just, I mean, you could tell that there's editing, like there's pain in trying to bring it as brief as possible, as clean as possible, yeah."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "Yeah, so it's, the way I think of it is, it's a little book of big science and big ideas."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Yeah, really big ideas in brief little packages."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "And I wrote it so that people could read it."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "I love reading on the beach."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "I love reading essays on the

scientists or is this for the civilians, right?"}, {"time": 2874, "text": "So he speaks for the people, for the civilians."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "He speaks for the people and I'd be like, no, you have to."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And so he made, after one terrible argument that we had where it was really starting to affect our relationship because we were so mad at each other all the time, he made these little signs, writing and science."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "And we only use them, this was like, when you pulled out a sign, that's it."}, {"time": 2900, "text": "Like the other person just wins and you have to stop fighting about it and that's it."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And so we just did that."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "And we didn't really have to use it too much for this book because this book was in some ways, I didn't have to learn a lot of new things for this book."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "I had to learn some, but a lot of what I learned for How Emotions Are Made really stood me in good stead for this book."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So there was a little bit, each essay was a little bit of learning."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "A couple were, was a little more than the small amount."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "But I didn't have so much trouble here."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "I had a lot of trouble with the first book."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "But still even here, he would tell me that I could take something out and I really wanted to keep it."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "And I think we only use the signs once."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book, I would love that."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Can we talk about, so one of the essays looks at evolution."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It looks at evolution."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Let me ask the big question."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "Did the human brain evolve to think?"}, {"time": 2973, "text": "That's essentially the question that you address in the essay."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "The big caveat here is that we don't really know why brains evolved."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "The big why questions are called teleological questions."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "And in general, scientists should avoid those questions because we don't know really why, we don't know the why."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "However, for a very long time, the assumption was that evolution worked in a progressive upward scale, that you start off with simple organisms and those organisms get more complex and more complex and more complex."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "Now, obviously that's true in some like really general way, right, that life started off as single cell organisms and things got more complex."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "But the idea that brains evolved in some upward trajectory from simple brains in simple animals to complex brains in complex animals is called a phylogenetic scale."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "And that phylogenetic scale is embedded in a lot of evolutionary thinking, including Darwin's actually."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And it's been seriously challenged, I would say, by modern evolutionary biology."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And so thinking is something that, rationality is something that humans, at least in the West, really prize as a great human achievement."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story is that brains evolved in like sedimentary rock with a layer for instincts, that's your lizard brain, and a layer on top of that for emotions, that's your limbic system, limbic meaning border."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So it borders the parts that are for instincts."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And then the neocortex or new cortex where rationality is supposed to live."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "That's the sort of traditional story."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "It just keeps getting layered on top by evolution."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "And so you can think about, I mean, sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "The way I sometimes like to think about it is thinking about the cerebral cortex like icing on an already baked cake, where the cake is your inner beast."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions that have to be contained by the cortex."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "And it's just, it's a fiction, it's a myth."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "It's a myth that you can trace all the way back to stories about morality in ancient Greece."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "But what you can do is look at the scientific record and say, well, there are other stories that you could tell about brain evolution and the context in which brains evolved."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "So when you look at creatures who don't have brains and you look at creatures who do, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "And you can look at some animals."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "So we call, scientists call an environment that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "What are the things, what are the parts of the environment that matter to that animal?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "And so there are some animals whose niche hasn't changed in 400 million years."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "So they're not, these creatures are modern creatures but they're living in a niche that hasn't changed much."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "And so their biology hasn't changed much."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes that lurk deep in the molecular structure of cells."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And so you can, by looking at various animals in their developmental state, meaning not, you don't look at adult animals, you look at embryos of animals and developing animals, you can see, you can piece together a different story."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And that story is that brains evolved under the selection pressure of hunting."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "That in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene where animals deliberately ate one another."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And what, so before the Cambrian period, the animals didn't really have, well, they didn't have brains, but they also didn't have senses really, the very, very rudimentary senses."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons is called an amphioxus or a lancelet."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "And little amphioxus has no eyes, it has no ears, it has no nose, it has no eyes."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark for circadian rhythm purposes."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And it can't hear, it has a vestibular cell to keep its body upright."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It has a very rudimentary sense of touch and it doesn't really have any internal organs other than this like basically stomach."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "It's like a, just like a, it doesn't have an enteric nervous system."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "It doesn't have like a gut that moves like we do."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "It just has basically a tube."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "So it's like a little container, yeah."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "And so, and really it doesn't move very much."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "It can move, it just sort of wriggles."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "It doesn't have very sophisticated movement."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "And it's this really sweet little animal."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "It sort of wriggles its way to a spot and then plants itself in the sand and just filters food as the food goes by."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And then when the food concentration decreases, it just ejects itself, wriggles to some spot randomly where probabilistically there will be more food and plants itself again."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "So it's not really aware, very aware that it has an environment."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "It has a niche, but that niche is very small and it's not really experiencing that niche very much."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "So it's basically like a little stomach on a stick."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "That's really what it is."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And, but when animals start to literally hunt each other, all of a sudden it becomes important to have, to be able to sense your environment."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Cause you need to know, is that blob up ahead gonna eat me or should I eat it?"}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And so all of a sudden you want, distance senses are very useful."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "And so in the water, distance senses are vision and a little bit hearing."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "Olfaction, smelling and touch, because in the water touch is a distance sense cause you can feel the vibration, so it's right."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So on land, you know, vision is a distance sense, touch not so much, but for elephants maybe, right?"}, {"time": 3418, "text": "The vibrations."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "Vibrations, olfaction definitely because of the distance sense."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "And so it's very important to have a sense of touch and olfaction definitely because of the concentration of, you know, the more concentrated something is, the more likely it is to be close to you."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "So animals developed senses."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "They developed a head, like a literal head."}, {"time": 3440, "text": "So amphyoxus doesn't even have a head really."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "It's just a long."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "What's the purpose of a head?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Is it to have a jaw?"}, {"time": 3450, "text": "So jaw, so yes, jaws are a major."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "Useful feature."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Yeah, obviously they're a major adaptation after there's a split between vertebrates and invertebrates."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So amphyoxus is thought to be very, very similar to the animal that's before that split."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "But then after the development, very quickly after the development of a head is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "And what goes along with that is the development of a brain."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "It's weird, is that just a coincidence that the thing, the part of our body, of the mammal, I think, body that we eat with and attack others with is also the thing that contains all the majority of the brain type of stuff."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "Well, actually the brain goes with the development of a head and the development of a visual system and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "So your senses are developing and the other thing that's happening is that animals are getting bigger because they're, and also their niche is getting bigger."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Well, this is the, just sorry to take a tiny tangent on the niche thing is it seems like the niche is getting bigger, but not just bigger, like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "So predation seems to create, the whole world becomes your oyster, whatever, but you also start to carve out the places in which you can operate the best."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "Yeah, and in fact, that's absolutely right."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind, your ability to make inferences about the inner life of other creatures actually developed under the selection pressure of predation because it makes you a better predator."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Do you ever look at, you just said you looked at babies as these wiring creatures."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "Do you ever think of humans as just clever predators?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Like that there's, underneath it all is this the Nietzschean will to power in all of its forms?"}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Or are we now friendlier?"}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Yeah, so it's interesting."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "I mean, there are zeitgeists in how humans think about themselves, right?"}, {"time": 3599, "text": "And so if you look in the 20th century, you can see that the idea of an inner beast that we're just predators, we're just basically animals, baseless animals, violent animals that have to be contained by culture and by our prodigious neocortex really took hold, particularly after World War I, and really held sway for much of that century."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say, you know, we're talking mainly about Western scientific writing, Western philosophical writing."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And then, you know, late 90s maybe, you start to see books and articles about our social nature, that we're social animals."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And we are social animals, but what does that mean exactly?"}, {"time": 3657, "text": "And about."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "It's us carving out different niches in the space of ideas, it looks like."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "I think so, I think so."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "So, you know, do humans, can humans be violent?"}, {"time": 3675, "text": "Can humans be really helpful?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And humans are interesting creatures because, you know, other animals can also be helpful to one another."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "In fact, there's a whole literature, booming literature on how other animals support one another."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "They regulate each other's nervous systems in interesting ways, and they will be helpful to one another, right?"}, {"time": 3703, "text": "So for example, there's a whole literature on rodents and how they signal one another what is safe to eat, and they will perform acts of generosity to their conspecifics that are related to them, or who they were raised with."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "So if an animal was raised in a litter that they were raised in, although not even at the same time, they'll be more likely to help that animal."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So there's always some kind of physical relationship between animals that predicts whether or not they'll help one another."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "For humans, you know, we have ways of categorizing who's in our group and who isn't by nonphysical ways, right?"}, {"time": 3752, "text": "Even by just something abstract, like an idea."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "And we are much more likely to extend help to people in our own group, whatever that group may be at that moment, whatever feature you're using to do that."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Feature you're using to define who's in your group and who isn't."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "We're more likely to help those people than even members of our own family at times."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So humans are much more flexible in their, in the way that they help one another, but also in the way that they harm one another."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "So I don't think I subscribe to, I don't think I subscribe to, you know, we are primarily this or we are primarily that."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "I don't think humans have essences in that way, really."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "I apologize to take us in this direction for a brief moment, but I've been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently in terms of reading."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And is there something that you think about in terms of the nature of evil from a neuroscience perspective?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "Is there some lessons that are sort of hopeful about human civilization that we can find in our brain with regard to the Hitlers of the world?"}, {"time": 3841, "text": "Do you think about the nature of evil?"}, {"time": 3847, "text": "I don't know that what I have to say is so useful from a, I don't know that I can say as a neuroscientist, well, here's a study that, you know, so I sort of have to take off my lab coat, right?"}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And now I'm gonna now conjecture as a human who just also, who has opinions, but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "It's just, the question is really how much encouragement does it take from the environment to get them to do something bad?"}, {"time": 3911, "text": "That's what I kind of, when I look at the life of Hitler, it seems like there's so many places where... Something could have intervened."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "Intervene, no, it could change completely the person."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "I mean, there's like the caricature, like the obvious places where he was an artist and if he wasn't rejected as an artist, he was a reasonably good artist."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So that could have changed, but just his entire, like where he went in Vienna and all these kinds of things, like little interactions could have changed and there's probably millions of other people who are capable, who the environment may be able to mold in the same way it did this particular person to create this particular kind of charismatic leader in this particular moment of time."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "Absolutely, and I guess the way that I would say it, I would agree 100% and I guess the way that I would say it is like this, in the West, we have a way of reasoning about causation, which focuses on single, simple causes for things."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "There's an essence to Hitler, there's an essence to his character."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "He was born with that essence or it was forged very, very early in his life and that explains the horrible landscape of his behavior."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "But there's another way to think about it, a way that actually is much more consistent with what we know about biology, how biology works in the physical world."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "And that is that most things are complex, not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard, but complex as in complexity, that is more than the sum of their parts and that most phenomena have many, many weak nonlinear interacting causes."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And so little things that we might not even be aware of can shift someone's developmental trajectory from this to that and that's enough to take it on a whole set of other paths and that these things are happening all the time."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So it's not random and it's not really, it's not deterministic in the sense that like everything you do determines your outcome, but it's a little more like you're nudging someone from one set of possibilities to another set of possibilities."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "But I think the thing that I find optimistic is that the other side of that coin is also true."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "So look at all the people who risked their lives to help people they didn't even know."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "And the thing that I came away with, but the thing I came away with was, look at how generous people were in that."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Oh, he's making, there are a lot of people he makes fun of and that's fine, but think about like those two people two guys, those."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "The Trump supporter guys."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Those guys."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "That was cool, there was kindness in them, right?"}, {"time": 4113, "text": "They took a complete stranger in a pandemic into their house."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "Who does that?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Like that's a really nice thing."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "Or there's one scene, I mean, I don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but there's one scene where he goes in, he dresses up as a Jew, I laugh myself sick at that scene, seriously, but he goes in and there are these two old Jewish ladies."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "What a bunch of sweethearts, oh my gosh."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "Like really, I mean, that was what I was struck by actually."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter, right?"}, {"time": 4155, "text": "I mean, she was really kind."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "And yeah, so that's really what I was more struck by."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Like sure, there are other people who do very bad things or say bad things or whatever, but like there's one guy who's completely stoic, like the guy who's sending the messages, I don't know if it's facts or whatever."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "He's just completely stoic, but he's doing his job actually."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "Like you don't know what he was thinking inside his head, you don't know what he's feeling, but he was totally professional doing his job."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So I guess I just, I had a bit of a different view, I guess."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "So I also think that about people, I think everybody is capable of kindness, but the question is how much does it take and what are the circumstances?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "So for some people it's gonna take a lot and for some people it only takes a little bit, but are we actually cultivating an environment for the next generation that provides opportunities for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness or, and I'm not saying that as like a Pollyanna ish person."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "I think there's a lot of room for competition and debate and so on, but I don't see Hitler as an anomaly and I never have, that was even before I learned anything about neuroscience."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "And now I would say knowing what we know about developmental trajectories and life histories and how important that is, knowing what we know about that the whole question of like nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "We have the kind of nature that requires nurture, we have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born with unfinished brains where the brains, their brains are wired across a 25 year period with wiring instructions from the world that is created for them."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And so I don't think Hitler is an anomaly, even if it's less probable that that would happen, it's possible that it could happen again and it's not like, you know, he's a bad seed."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "I mean, that doesn't, I just wanna say for like, of course he's completely 100% responsible for his actions and all the bad things that happen."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "So I'm not in any way, this is not me saying."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "But the environment is also responsible in part for creating the evil in this world."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "So like Hitler's in different versions of even more subtle, more smaller scale versions of evil."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But I tend to believe that there's a much stronger, I don't like to talk about evolutionary advantages, but it seems like it makes sense for love to be a more powerful emergent phenomena of our collective intelligence versus hate and evil and destruction."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "Because from a survival, from a niche perspective, it seems to be like in my own life and my thinking about the intuition about the way humans work together to solve problems, it seems that love is a very useful tool."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "I definitely agree with you."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "But I think the caveat here is that, you know, humans, the research suggests that humans are capable of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity to people in their in group."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "Right, so we're also tribal."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's the kitschy way to say it."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "We're tribes, we're tribal, yeah."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So that's the kitschy way to say it."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "What I would say is that, you know,

individual people, they're talking about, you know, the species, what's better for the species, the survivability of the species."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "And what's better for the survivability of the species is variation, that we have lots of cultures with lots of different solutions because if the environment were to change drastically, some of those solutions will work better than others."},

using, you know, those movies like the War of the Worlds or Pacific Rim, you know, where like aliens come down from outer space and they, you know, wanna kill humans."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "And so all the humans band together as a species and they all, like all the, you know, little squabbling from countries and whatever all, you know, goes away and everyone is just one big, you know."},

4709, "text": "And that's not what you see happening."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "What you do see happening, it is true that some people, I mean, we could use this as an example of essentialism also."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "So just to say, like exposure to the virus does not mean that you will become infected with a disease."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "So, I mean, in controlled studies, one of which was actually a coronavirus, not COVID, but this was, these are studies from 10 or so years ago, you know, only somewhere between 20 and 40% of people were developed respiratory illness

in these studies, the dose was consistent across all people and everything, you know, they were sequestered in hotel rooms and what they ate was, you know, measured out by scientists and so on."},

illness."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "You will be a carrier and you will spread the virus to other people, but you yourself may not, your immune system may be in a state that you can make enough

is the cause of a common cold or, you know, most people, if I asked this question, I can tell you, because I asked this question."}, {"time": 4821, "text": "So do you think a virus is the cause of a cold?"}, {"time": 4825, "text": "Most people would say, yes, I think it is."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "And then I say, yeah, well, only 20 to 40% of people develop respiratory illness in exposure to a

that, you know, when the environment changes, that is, there's a mutation of a virus that is incredibly infectious, some cultures will succumb, people in some cultures will succumb faster because of the particular norms and practices that they've developed in their culture versus other cultures."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Now, there could be some other, you know, thing that changes that where

disk, only a couple Earth masses."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So then from that remnant population, annulus of material, over a hundred million years, by just collisions, you grow the Earth and the

to know what's true though."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "I tried to have humility and always assume I don't really know the full story and keep pulling at the string, keep learning more and more."},

Heard, trials going on, it's a quick pause, it's going to resume next week."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "So again, this is one of those situations where, you know, I have very limited information

know that if I go there, then I'm going to want to watch it all."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "It's raw human relationships that is most toxic and it's most deep also because there's you can tell there's love probably still there's love, which is the interesting thing."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "They probably still love each other even though they hate each other."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "And like there's a lot of lying going on."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "It looks like it's Amber Heard lying to my foolish eyes."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "It seems like she's lying nonstop."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "But, you know, I want to know the full story and we'll never get to know it."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "But you see this raw, like postmortem on a relationship on a love affair that was clearly passionate."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "There was clearly something deep of a connection there."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "And it just that's the sad thing about love."}, {"time": 6805, "text":

{"time": 6813, "text": "So people who feel strongly are, I think, particularly vulnerable."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "Yeah, it's it's hard to talk about because I've dipped into like a podcast or something where other people are discussing bad vegan and like a pop culture way and they're analyzing it."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "And it's so annoying to listen to."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "So I'm like, oh, my God, that's totally wrong."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "That's totally wrong."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "Well, if they only knew this, well, I have no that's wrong."}, {"time": 6843,

difference because the world doesn't know much about you except for the Netflix documentary."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "There's a lot more information about both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and The Trial is revealing the real people."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "This one is so interesting."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "But I haven't watched it all."}, {"time": 6870, "text": "OK, but there's a

to."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "And sorry."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "I keep interrupting you."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "But on top of this, there are actors, too, which is very annoying."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "Because like I don't know if they're putting it be sure as hell looks like Amber Heard is putting on like a soap opera act."}, {"time": 6906, "text": "Soap opera meaning like really bad acting and lies."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "But I would say all of these things are really hard."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "People would say about me, I don't look like a victim."}, {"time": 6917,

Andrew told me that I'm like, are you sure?"}, {"time": 6936, "text": "Because it just does seem like an asshole thing to do."}, {"time": 6939, "text": "I guess it depends on the context."}, {"time": 6941, "text": "If we're in a business meeting and somebody talks over you to kind of make their point heard."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "But if it's a one on one situation, then it's not."}, {"time": 6948, "text": "I could argue that forever."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "But so a long time ago, I listened to there was a audio call, an audio that was released of a taped argument between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "And I don't remember why, like which one of them had taped it and if they knew it was being taped."}, {"time": 6966, "text": "But it was like an hour and a half."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "And I listened to it almost like you would listen to a podcast where I was doing other things, like cleaning my apartment."}, {"time": 6972, "text": "And I was fascinated listening to it to a fight."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "So I was and it's interesting, too, because it was just the audio, not so you're not looking at their body language, which can be completely misleading."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "And there was another podcast where they talked about how judges make worse decisions on whether or not somebody deserves parole or to be released on bail when they see the person in person versus if they're just looking at the information on paper."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "So I think body language and those kinds of things can be can actually be misleading."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "Or we think that like by looking somebody in the eye will know if they're lying or not, but the skilled liars are able to bypass that or they because I'm jumping all over the place."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "But one of the things about sociopaths is they're not going to have the same tell."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "So like if I was lying, somebody would know because I'm like stressed out, mortified, I'm probably doing all the things that we do when we lie because it's stressful for me, whereas they don't have those things."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "So I think that, you know, they could, for example, I think that they could pass a lie detector test."}, {"time": 7039, "text": "They also don't have like a startle response."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "So the activity in their brain, like if you and I watch something graphic and tragic on TV or watch something happen, like things would happen in our brains that don't happen in the brains of sociopaths."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "So they don't react to things in the same way that that we do."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "Again, you keep assuming I'm not associated."}, {"time": 7060, "text":

7066, "text": "Let's get back to the what were we talking about?"}, {"time": 7069, "text": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "So the audio that I heard made me, without knowing anything else, made me very inclined to be Team Johnny Depp."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "Based on that, just based on that audio."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "Well, that's how the people are feeling about this whole interaction."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "By the way, I do think it's a very healthy thing to do in a relationship is to record each other for months at a time."}, {"time": 7092,

suppose you could look back at all human relations and be like, this was ridiculous."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "But when you're in it, you don't."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "I wondered that too."},

me wonder what's real at all."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "Because you have to remember they're actors too."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Yeah, I don't think he would have filed a lawsuit."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "No, I mean, I'm joking."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "But no, I mean, my point is if somebody was trying to make the argument that like he's the abuser and that he's lying and he's full of shit, it sort of doesn't make sense that he would have filed a lawsuit unless he's trying to have this all come out in the open because he believes he's in the right."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "You know, again, I have no idea."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "As a fan of love and human nature, I appreciate the fact that they went through this."}, {"time": 7191, "text": "I know it's probably extremely painful."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "But it's fascinating to watch human relationships be presented in such a wrong way and it made me realize how rare it is to get a glimpse like that."}, {"time": 7204, "text": "Yeah, and I think one of the reasons I like that book Confessions of a Sociopath also is it's, you know, female who's writing it."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "And I think statistically men are more likely to be sociopaths, maybe not."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "I mean, these are all things where a lot of times there exist statistics that would be inherently hard to get."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "So who knows?"}, {"time": 7230, "text": "But I think that people tend to think of sociopaths more as men and then which probably gives female sociopaths the advantage in that people are less likely to like the Elizabeth Holmes, like people who are really manipulative and really good at it."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "And part of how they're able to succeed is that people don't

"text": "Whereas, you know, the way things happened and he dragged me around the country and like, what were we doing in Tennessee?"}, {"time": 7285, "text": "And then why didn't like nothing really makes any sense."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "But and also all of the things that he did to me and had me do, it was as if all of those things together only make sense if his primary goal was to maximally destroy me and also make it like have me burn all my bridges and make it so I'll never recover."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And when you read a book like that, you understand that that's that's what he wanted."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "Like, that's his life."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "It's like a game."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "Like, what do you think?"}, {"time": 7321, "text":

are just different."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "So, you know, he spent a year incarcerated because he never got out on bail."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But then he got out."}, {"time": 7350, "text":

infuriated."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "But anyway, so I think for him, you know, the consequence of spending time in jail is sort of like an inconvenience."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "You know, it's like life is a game."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "And so he wouldn't feel if you're not capable of being emotionally hurt, then you're, you know, you have immense power because you can go around and do things."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "And people can't hurt you."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "It's like a superpower."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "And he did this for people who are not familiar."}, {"time":

Florida."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "Strong, strong words."}, {"time": 7418, "text": "Well, it's just like when there's the weirdest story about, you know, people eating Tide pods and then doing crazy."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "It's like it's always in, it's always in Florida."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "So I feel like whenever crazy things, so to me it makes sense that he would have spent time in Florida before and that's where."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "Crazy in a good way."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "And I mean that on an insult on him."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "I also like she's an

things."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "Well, jumping around, but one of the things you said that was disturbingly misleading is the ending of the documentary."}, {"time": 7457, "text": "And the ending has a phone call, I think, of you and Anthony talking."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "So high level, let me ask."}, {"time": 7467, "text": "How many times have you talked with Anthony since you got out of prison and what did you talk about?"}, {"time": 7475, "text": "And why is that quote misleading, that segment of audio misleading?"}, {"time": 7481, "text": "My issue with it also was that it was deliberately misleading, which was what was particularly infuriating about it."}, {"time": 7492, "text": "And then also there was, it was like there were things, one major thing that was incorrect that I think helped allow people to make an incorrect conclusion at the end was in the film it talks about, I say something about how my accountant made a joke about if I married him, he could easily transfer me money without tax consequences."}, {"time": 7513, "text": "And then the film has me saying something like, you know, and then within 24 hours we were married."}, {"time": 7520, "text":

he could give me money and that wasn't the case."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So you're part mastermind of some kind of scheme that involve money transfer and you got married and that kind of thing."},

know, New York is full of legitimate people with loads of money."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "If I really wanted to marry somebody for money in New York, it wouldn't be that hard to do."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "But anyway, it was like it was just a deliberate making it seem like my intention was, you know, to marry him for his fictitious money."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "Okay, so that's one."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "And either way."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "Let's go to that ending thing because we're on that sort of topic."}, {"time": 7569, "text": "When you got out of prison, you know, what the film implies is that whatever, there's a small aspect of your mind that still wants to continue a relationship with Anthony."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "Yeah, that's not the case."}, {"time": 7586, "text": "And not just that, but there's still flirtation and that kind of a body and collide."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And then I was laughing."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "Like, we got the world like at our fingertips, we're playing."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "So, I mean, one of the exciting things about being like a couple that's fucking with the world that's getting away with something is that there's all these powerful forces that want to catch you in a crime and you keep getting away with it."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "In some romantic world, it could be."}, {"time": 7627, "text": "And also, I always have to keep reminding people like, get away with what?"}, {"time": 7631, "text": "Because I lost everything and all these people lost other, you know, people I cared about lost a lot."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "My mother lost a lot, but I lost everything too."}, {"time": 7642, "text": "Yeah, your restaurant, your dream."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "Yeah, my reputation, my stuff, my home, you know, ending up with millions of dollars of debt."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "Like, it's not even like I lost it all and then it's a clean slate."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "It's like I lost it all and now I have this like giant boulder of, or like this wobbly, unclear how to like, yeah."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "So when people say, got away with something, I'm always like, got away with what?"}, {"time": 7676, "text": "Destroying my life and ending up in debt?"}, {"time": 7678, "text": "Because that's, it's not even like, you can't even sort of point to like, as if I was trying to do something and then oops, that happened."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "It's like, there's no, nothing that logically makes sense if somebody was trying to decipher my, you know, whatever motives I might have had."}, {"time": 7699, "text": "Yeah, you didn't walk away from the explosion, you were inside the explosion."}, {"time": 7703, "text": "Okay, but that said, the movie implied, and so, I mean, it's interesting to ask, not just in clarifying the movie, but just as a human being, you're out of prison, he's out of prison."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "There was, you know, there was that toxic connection, but it was there, and there's a depth to it, so toxic connections can be pretty deep."}, {"time": 7733, "text": "So how, what was the conversation like and how often have you talked with him?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "Well, we don't speak anymore, and that call at the end was... Not even on Gchat?"}, {"time": 7746, "text": "Was recorded on, like, I recorded the call and gave it to them, you know, so I was like, deliberately recording him."}, {"time": 7746, "text": "It's not like I was caught on a hot mic, like, I made that call."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "It's part of the documentary."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "I recorded him intentionally, I was trying to get him to repeat some of like, the kookier things he would say about like, his meat suit or some of the weird like, the things about something not being real."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "The more like, fantastical things, I was trying to get him to repeat those things."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "It was probably like a 40 minute call, which I mean, it's actually on my phone, I still have it, I haven't gone back to listen to it, but...

it self serving?"}, {"time": 8035, "text": "Why did you talk to him anyway?"}, {"time": 8040, "text": "Because he was getting out, he was going to be out free out in the open while I was going to be

his account."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "Can I just say, because Joe has an account for his dog, too."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "I just love when people do that."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "Because I

could tell were directed at me, you know, like little things that only I would know, you know, like random things, like things that were like the equivalent of like an inside joke that you have."},

in a twisted, but I think understandable way."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "Sort of a sick way that I was fully aware of is that here I am having gone through this completely like messed up thing that now I'm in trouble for."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "Everybody's looking at and nobody understands."}, {"time": 8228, "text": "And so there was this unfortunate situation of the only person who

it in the same way that which is why."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "I was able to later on, like in the context of recording those calls, I was able to talk to him in this detached way because I know he doesn't give a shit that like he doesn't give any shits about what he did to my mother or me or anybody or anything just doesn't care."}, {"time": 8280, "text": "So he's certainly not going to care if I, you know, he's never going to say like I'm sorry or I did a bad thing or or like he's not going to be affected."}, {"time": 8292, "text": "Like if I yelled and screamed at him, that would just be frustrating for me."}, {"time": 8292, "text": "And he would actually probably be gratified by that."}, {"time": 8300, "text": "So that gave you that empowered you in being cold and sort of distant."},

he could still manipulate me one day or whatever."}, {"time": 8343, "text": "It was like safer to keep that there than to not know where he was and if I was going to like be walking Leon and turn the

like, I hate that."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "I hate that ending."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "But I sort of assumed a lot of people saw it for what it was."}, {"time": 8426, "text": "They saw that it was like the director doing a weird thing and that it was kind of just weird and off and like, that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 8433, "text": "But they didn't draw conclusions from it."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "So it was basically you joking around, like flirting almost."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "It made it seem like as if we're still friendly."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "And there's more to come."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "It's almost like there's going to be a bad vegan too."}, {"time": 8448, "text": "And then also, I mean, it made it seem like, you know, if I was laughing with him that

it, I mean, like, how did you allow that to happen?"}, {"time": 9448, "text": "Or maybe a better way to ask is, how did he make that happen?"}, {"time": 9460, "text": "Well, I was conditioned to it before because before he was always checking my phone, which was wildly infuriating."}, {"time": 9460, "text": "And I feel like, like."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "You fixed it by giving him the phone."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "Well, I mean, the conditions were different later on."}, {"time": 9479, "text": "But in some sense, I didn't want my phone because everything, like I was in a state

up."}, {"time": 9486, "text": "So there was no, like, I wasn't going to fight back on anything."}, {"time": 9496, "text": "Before, when he would take my phone and look through it, it was, it was infuriating."}, {"time": 9496, "text": "And he sort of forced me to get used to it."}, {"time": 9505, "text": "And this is, again, something that, like, people who've been in cults would understand because it's like they condition you to not react negatively to things that you would normally react negatively to."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "And like, if I was in a relationship, like, if somebody,

mentioned that he might help make Leon immortal."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "All of that was always really vague."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "Intentionally, like a lot of what he talked about was always very vague."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "But a lot of that stuff was very vague."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "And again, like, slowly over time."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "And a lot of those things, too, are things that, you know, conveniently, you kind of can't disprove."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "So it's almost like, you know, people believe in God or religious people believe certain things."},

"text": "He acted like he had lived many lifetimes, and had all kinds of wisdom from having lived all these prior lifetimes, and being aware of it."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "So was that, and it was vague, but it was somehow believable?"}, {"time": 9644, "text": "Or is it just like part of the charm?"}, {"time": 9644, "text": "Like, what, how do you, how do you not call bullshit?"}, {"time": 9660, "text": "Not necessarily bullshit."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "I understand when you're smitten in whatever way."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "But like, a little more details, proof."}, {"time":

after."}, {"time": 9697, "text": "I may have gone looking for it."}, {"time": 9697, "text": "But anyway, it was in the conversation with Joe where Darren explains, he's somebody I would love to meet, a mentalist and an illusionist, because they understand a lot of the ways in which the mind can be manipulated."}, {"time": 9716, "text": "So I feel like they would, if they looked at everything about my situation, they would be able to understand better how he was able to get me to believe things or go along with things."}, {"time": 9716, "text": "Because Darren Brown is pretty fascinating what he does."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And he's really seems like a very kind person, and he's very open about it."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And when he was talking to Joe, he said this thing that, and I use this quote in my book."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And again, I'm paraphrasing because I don't have it in front of me."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "But it's like, he says something about how we want to believe the lie, because we'd rather believe that it's something amazing than just that ugly and pathetic a lie."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "And whatever he said was said in a much better way."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "And so he was explaining it in the context of the way that an illusionist or whatever they're called is able to pull off certain things, which is about somebody who was watching and watched that person leverage people's tendency to want to believe that something amazing and cool is about to happen versus this is just a really ugly, pathetic lie."}, {"time": 9794, "text": "So I think that a lot of the things that Mr. Fox, that he put forward, I couldn't understand it from the perspective of it being a lie because it just seemed too weird and crazy."}, {"time": 9794, "text": "So I think that this happens sometimes where you believe somebody because it seems so weird that they would lie about it."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "I think that somebody has, or it's been said sometimes that the more fantastical the lie, the more believable it is because you don't believe that somebody would tell that lie."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "And I think something also that Mr. Fox, people like him are capable of doing is going out and lying in very brazen ways that normal people would be terrified to do."}, {"time": 9842, "text": "And that kind of also makes it more believable."}, {"time": 9842, "text": "So if somebody could go out on a world stage and lie and not kind of feel weird about that or even knowing that it's a lie that can be pointed out as being a lie."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "There's also the layer of to what extent is this person in some way also delusional themselves and sort of believing their lies because people have asked me that and I've wondered the same thing."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "To what extent did he believe some of the stuff he was saying?"}, {"time": 9874, "text": "And I think probably there was some sort of delusional aspect, almost like he was sort of halfway aware of playing his own sort of virtual reality game, like he was in some kind of metaverse in his brain."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "So you think he believed some of the things he was saying?"}, {"time": 9894, "text": "In some way, yeah."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "Or he wanted to, because he wanted to be his own, he wanted to be a superhero."},

with Black Ops that is by definition under the radar."}, {"time": 9926, "text": "So I mean, that's obviously a huge red flag now going forward."}, {"time": 9945, "text": "First of all, if somebody tells you that information pretty quickly, that's itself a red flag."}, {"time": 9952, "text": "You crossed that off my list of pickup lines."}, {"time": 9958, "text": "But, you know, conveniently, if he say in some world he actually did work for like Blackwater or one of those places, I wouldn't be able to just call someplace and verify it."}, {"time": 9976, "text": "Anyway, I think that in some psychological way that I don't understand, he probably did in some way halfway exists in this world where he was this, you know, like fighter and he would say things like, it's because of people like me that people like you can sleep at night, which is probably a line out of a movie that I've never seen."}, {"time": 9999, "text": "I feel like a lot of things."}, {"time": 9999, "text": "That is a great."}, {"time": 9999, "text": "Who said that?"}, {"time": 9999, "text": "Is that really a line out of a movie?"}, {"time": 9999, "text": "It's not a movie."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "You know what would happen at Rikers is when these things would happen where one of us couldn't think of something and you're like, oh, who was that actor in that movie in that thing?"}, {"time": 10019, "text":

on those who would harm us."}, {"time": 10064, "text": "And there's a lot of variations of this, but basically we depend, our entire society depends on bad motherfuckers who are willing to fight to protect our freedoms, to protect our wellbeing."}, {"time": 10084, "text": "And one of the things about the United States is because we're surrounded by water, we don't get to see the violence that's

charm."}, {"time": 10956, "text": "So, you know, when you look at I think it was like James Mattis invested a bunch of money with Elizabeth Holmes and all these people were involved with her and nobody really did their due diligence where they just sort of trusted her."}, {"time": 10969, "text": "And Jeffrey Epstein, I think it's still unclear where he got all of his money, but the guy Wexner, Les Wexner, who had, you know, an enormous amount of money and somehow very quickly turned over management of it to Jeffrey Epstein."}, {"time": 10986, "text": "And so people wonder, like, why

very, very crafty and getting another thing that people like him do and cults do also is to get is to get you somehow compromised because then they've got you."}, {"time": 11024, "text": "So I think some kind of usually sex related."}, {"time": 11029, "text": "And with Epstein, certainly, you know, he was known to have cameras everywhere."}, {"time": 11029, "text": "And so if he got any of these

know."}, {"time": 11160, "text": "But I think I feel like I find the whole situation gut wrenching because I think Jeffrey Epstein is a straight up like straight up sociopath, like no question with her."}, {"time": 11184, "text": "Everybody's calling her evil."}, {"time": 11184, "text": "And for her to have enabled and done a lot of the things that she did could potentially require."}, {"time":

not enough of a good person to have, you know, horribly victimized these young girls and destroy their lives."}, {"time": 11230, "text": "But she could have, I feel like I'm gonna get bashed for

just the way that things that are described about the way that she like was so subservient to him in this kind of astonishing way that seems really weird and abnormal."}, {"time": 11316, "text": "And

out again by extreme circumstances."}, {"time": 11429, "text": "He got in a car accident and almost died."}, {"time": 11429, "text": "And that's what ended up getting him out of the cult that he was in."}, {"time": 11429, "text": "But really smart guy, was targeted when he was young, got pulled into The Moonies."}, {"time": 11441, "text": "But watching this interview of him on her show, he's

triggering, it's like, I use air quotes."}, {"time": 11582, "text": "Yeah, it's funny because good words get taken up and then they get destroyed."}, {"time": 11586, "text": "Or overusing

like I've been drunk at a party and eaten a bunch of stuff that one would think I would never eat."}, {"time": 12028, "text": "But it's not like I ran to the store and bought it or went to a

something that's not quite functional."}, {"time": 12074, "text": "Sometimes I'll be like, I must have avocado, or I'll want to eat an entire parsley salad."}, {"time": 12074, "text": "And then it's

the grass fed butter?"}, {"time": 12107, "text": "Because it wasn't regular butter."}, {"time": 12107, "text": "Ew, no."}, {"time": 12107, "text": "But this grass fed butter, I felt like I just wanted, I needed it."}, {"time": 12121, "text": "So there's probably something in there, and maybe I could have gone and just taken a lot of vitamin K and then not eaten the butter."}, {"time": 12128,

little."}, {"time": 12211, "text": "So I think all of those things have calcium and other minerals in common, so there's probably something there that I needed."}, {"time": 12211, "text": "Because you'd think as a little kid, I wouldn't be drawn to oily fish and bones and eggshells."}, {"time": 12231, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting because you're saying the explanation for the craving is probably the nutrients you're getting."}, {"time": 12231, "text": "But when you're imagining the craving, you're not obviously imagining the nutrients, you're imagining the texture, the taste, the

tomatoes?"}, {"time": 12254, "text": "Well, I think we determine that love is impossible to define."}, {"time": 12267, "text": "Maybe it's generational because it's a big Russian thing with potatoes

wasn't coming up with new dishes."}, {"time": 12298, "text": "It was the people that worked there."}, {"time": 12298, "text": "So I feel like if I could take credit for something, it would be recognizing talent."}, {"time": 12298, "text": "And when dishes were developed, this is when I was on my own."}, {"time": 12317, "text": "So it was opened with Matthew and Jeffrey."}, {"time": 12317, "text": "And then within a year, Matthew was out and Jeffrey was still involved as like the corporate sort of side of it."}, {"time": 12329, "text": "But then over time, I separated from that infrastructure as well and then was completely on my own."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "And in part, I did that because I was growing One Lucky Duck on the side and that was growing and growing and growing."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "And I knew there was something there."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "And yet the two businesses were completely intertwined."}, {"time": 12348, "text": "And so potential investors would come at me and they would see this very messy situation where I owned One Lucky Duck and Jeffrey Chatterot owned the restaurant."}, {"time": 12348, "text": "And how do we move forward from there?"}, {"time": 12360, "text": "And then people would say I should shut down the restaurant and just focus on One Lucky Duck."}, {"time": 12360, "text": "And I wanted them all to be together under one umbrella and to move forward where everybody's incentives were aligned."}, {"time": 12371, "text": "What was the magic?"}, {"time": 12371, "text": "Why was it so successful so quickly, would you say?"}, {"time": 12375, "text": "I want to half jokingly, but not joking, but sort of say that it was about the love and the food and the space."}, {"time": 12383, "text": "Can you define love?"}, {"time": 12386, "text": "But there was something special."}, {"time": 12386, "text": "So when people ask me about opening a restaurant, I say I don't want to get back into the restaurant business unless it's the same restaurant in the same space."}, {"time": 12396, "text": "Because there was something about that space that felt, I guess, felt magical, for lack of a better word, and the energy of a lot of the people there."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "And I think that people really cared about it."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "And so for whatever reason, there was an energy about the place."}, {"time": 12418, "text": "Would you ever do it again?"}, {"time": 12421, "text": "Would you ever consider reopening?"}, {"time": 12422, "text": "In the same space."},

I should have an answer prepared."}, {"time": 12460, "text": "It's too difficult to sort of pick favorites, but if somebody would force you to choose, you'd have to."}, {"time": 12469, "text": "I was eating something once and I had the thought that if I was going to die, I would come here and order plate after plate of this and eat this."}, {"time": 12478, "text": "Do you remember what it was?"},

bar, which had an entrance on 17th Street."}, {"time": 12492, "text": "So it was kind of like this L shape."}, {"time": 12493, "text": "And then there was a huge garden in the back."}, {"time": 12495,

12514, "text": "This is just a funny that we surrounded it, but Bar Jamon was this tiny little bar."}, {"time": 12521, "text": "And I went in there once with Tobin late and I don't know why we ended up going there, but it was right before they closed and drank red wine and they had tomato bread."}, {"time": 12534, "text": "And it's just like a baguette, although it's a Spanish or whatever."},

it."}, {"time": 12547, "text": "It's like they rub it and the tomato juice is all over it."}, {"time": 12551, "text": "It was just bread and tomato juice and probably some garlic flavor and really good salt and some wine and red wine."}, {"time": 12560, "text": "And we sat there and ordered a plate, ate it, ordered another one, ate it, ordered another one."}, {"time": 12565, "text": "I think we had like six plates."}, {"time": 12567, "text": "And I remember sitting there thinking I could just eat this until my stomach bursts."}, {"time": 12572, "text": "And then, and so if this is like, if somebody was like, what's the last, I would just want to sit there and eat plate after plate."}, {"time": 12579, "text": "I think if you went back there and ate the same thing, it wouldn't taste nearly as good."}, {"time": 12582, "text": "And like, was there something magical about that night, about the way that bread was made on that night, the way you felt at that night, the wine, the something?"}, {"time": 12596, "text": "Or do you think like, where's the power from that food come from?"}, {"time": 12600, "text": "Is it the food itself or is it the environment?"}, {"time": 12604,

12740, "text": "Like say you started dating somebody who then would get jealous or upset if you spent too much time working on something, right?"}, {"time": 12751, "text": "But that's like your life."}, {"time": 12753, "text": "So if you're working on some robotics thing and you're having some breakthrough and so you just want to spend a lot of time wherever you spend a lot of time doing those things, and then that other person got all bent out of shape and it became like a competition."}, {"time": 12767, "text": "That to me seems very unhealthy because if somebody, if it was like a

actually, or the easiest way to achieve that, at least for me, is actually legitimately be excited by the things the other person is excited by."}, {"time": 12800, "text": "So like not in some generic sense, it's good for them to be doing the robotics thing."}, {"time": 12806, "text": "It's more like you become a fan of all the cool things that they're doing in their life."}, {"time": 12814,

it's good for them to have their own thing."}, {"time": 12851, "text": "It's like I legit get excited by their own thing."}, {"time": 12856, "text": "Right, but that's what I mean."}, {"time": 12858,

that's possible."}, {"time": 12877, "text": "It's possible for that to be the case for somebody that might have an appreciation for what you're doing, but that's not what that person is going to go

the stuff, the easiest way you can talk about it is humor."}, {"time": 13082, "text": "The same with trauma, like personal trauma, the easiest stuff for him to talk about is laugh about it."},

there's no way you could redraw the whole screen."}, {"time": 473, "text": "And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably."}, {"time": 490, "text": "You could do a listing and it would scroll things up."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode and I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then."}, {"time": 510, "text": "So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things."}, {"time": 517, "text": "So I found out that I could draw a screen."}, {"time": 519, "text": "I could do a line feed at the bottom."}, {"time": 520, "text": "It would scroll it up once."}, {"time": 522, "text": "I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom."}, {"time": 524, "text": "And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the id Software days as well."}, {"time": 533, "text": "So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output."}, {"time": 545, "text": "Where so much of, until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do."}, {"time": 553, "text": "Where it's easy to say, OK, I want to scroll the screen."}, {"time": 556, "text": "You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset."}, {"time": 559,

wanted to do."}, {"time": 570, "text": "But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience."}, {"time": 576, "text": "Either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So much of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen."}, {"time": 591, "text": "It just has to happen 2 to 10 times faster than the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way, and it still works out."}, {"time": 606,

those virtual experiences from the very beginning."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And in the modern era of virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone and you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences, it does require work."}, {"time": 703, "text": "It's not at the level of what an old school console game

Python."}, {"time": 818, "text": "You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library."}, {"time": 827,

earth could do 10 years ago."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy paste it out of a website."}, {"time": 842, "text": "So that is really great."}, {"time": 844, "text": "When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things."}, {"time": 858, "text": "I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction."}, {"time": 863, "text": "I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of the historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things."}, {"time": 873, "text": "And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things."}, {"time": 878, "text": "And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially, it's the whole lifespan of the program."}, {"time": 900, "text": "And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between the continuous kind of revolving door of programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And there's all these other different aspects of it."}, {"time": 927, "text": "So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Probably not the best."}, {"time": 959,

more significant languages."}, {"time": 992, "text": "Like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways, but the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It's all of the things you've built on top of that."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these longterm supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, okay, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And it was interesting to see how when Google made

flabbergasted about that."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you

does not force you to."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions, but at the

that you can get and the different stuff that you can, ways you can deploy it, the portability that it gives you."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it because clearly there's enormous value here."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there and it's not falling apart."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs and you just see all of these bad things that are happening but it's still kind of limping along and

robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways where there's interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And that could change our engineering trade offs for the way we build certain things where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "I mean, that's one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And one of my pet ideas there is like, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And there would be ways that, you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less, but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation

doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything, even if it winds up being less efficient."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "So that applies a lot in programming where it's always good to know what you could do."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "If you really sat down and took it far, because sometimes there's discontinuities like around user reaction times, there are some points where the difference

command, twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold, but there are broad basins in the

the end."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort, it seems like efficiency isn't the thing that's being optimized for."},

go a lot of places with that where in the earliest days of programming, when you had finite, you could count the bytes that you had to work on this, you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf

you're building things of value."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "Now you can get into the argument about how you, what is user value?"}, {"time": 2089, "text": "How do you actually quantify that?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And there can be big arguments about that but it's easy to be able to say, okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're doing."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "This user over there with the big smile on their face, the moment of delight when something happened, there's a value that's happened there."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "I mean, you have to at least accept that there is a concept of user value even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it, you can usually make relative arguments about it."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "Well, this was better than this, we've improved things."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So being a servant to the user is your job when you're a developer, you wanna be producing something that other people are gonna find valuable."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "And if you are technically inclined then finding the right levers to be able to pull to be able to make a design that's going to produce the most value for the least amount of effort."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "And it always has to be kind of divided, there's a ratio there where you, it's a problem at the big tech companies, whether it's Meta Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, companies that have almost infinite money."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "I mean, I know their CFO will complain that it's not infinite money but from most developers standpoints it really does feel like it."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And it's almost counterintuitive that if you're working hard as a developer on something, there's always this thought, if only I had more resources, more people, more RAM, more megahertz, then my product will be better."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And that sense that at certain points, it's certainly true that if you are really hamstrung by this, removing an obstacle will make a better product, make more value."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "But if you're not making your core design decisions in this fiercely competitive way where you're saying feature A or feature B, you can't just say, let's do both."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Because then you're not making a value judgment about them."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "You're just saying, well, they both seem good."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "I don't wanna necessarily have to pick out which one is better or how much better and tell team B that, sorry, we're not gonna do this because A is more important."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "But that notion of always having to really critically value what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend, even the opportunity cost of doing something else, that's super important."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "Well, let me ask you about the big debates that you're mentioning of how to measure value."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route of imagining sort of somebody using a thing and imagining a smile on their face, imagining the experience of love and joy that you have when you use the thing."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "That's from a design perspective or if you're building more like a lower level thing for like Linux, you imagine a developer that might come across this and use it and become happy and better off because of it."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So where do you land on those things?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "Is it measurable?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "So I imagine like Meta and Google will probably try to measure the thing."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "They'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement or something, let's measure engagement."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And then I think there is a kind of, I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like, think of a future that's immeasurable and you try to make somebody in that future that's different from today happy."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So I do usually favor, if you can get any kind of a metric that's good, by all means, listen to the data."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "But you can go too far there where we've had problems where it's like, hey, we had a performance regression because our fancy new telemetry system is doing a bazillion file writes to kind of archive this stuff because we needed to collect information to determine if we were doing, if our plans were good."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "So when information is available, you should never ignore it."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "I mean, all of it."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "For actual users using the thing, human beings using the thing, large number of human beings, and you get to see sort of a lot of large numbers."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "So there's the zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new, you do kind of have to make a guess."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "But one of the points that I've been making at Meta is we have more than enough users now that anything somebody wants to try in VR, we have users that will be interested in that."},

everyone."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "There are going to be people, whether it's working in VR on your, like on your desktop replacement or communicating with people in different ways or playing the games."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "There are going to be probably millions of people, or at least if you pick some tiny niche that we're not in right now, there's still going to be thousands of people out there that have the headsets that would be your target market."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "And I tell people, pay attention to them."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Don't invent fictional users."},

you've got real users that you could be working with."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "But on the other hand, there is value to having a kind of wholeness of vision for a product."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "And companies like Meta have, they understand the trade offs where you can have a company like SpaceX or Apple in the Steve Jobs era, where you have a very powerful leading personality that can micromanage at a very low level and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different or that icon needs to change the tint there."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And they clearly get a lot of value out of it."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "They also burn through a lot of employees that have horror stories to tell about working there afterwards."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "My position is that you're at your best when you've got a leader that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend of everything below them."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "And they can have an informed opinion about everything that's going on."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you take somebody, you've got to believe that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience, you would hope that they've got wisdom that the just out of bootcamp person contributing doesn't have."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And that if they're like, well, that's wrong there, you probably shouldn't do it that way or even just don't do it that way, do it another way."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "So there's value there, but it can't go beyond a certain level."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying things that are just wrong right in front of me about technical things because he was not operating at that level."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "But when it does work and you do get that kind of passionate leader that's thinking about the entire product and just really deeply cares about not letting anything slip through the cracks, I think that's got a lot of value."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "But the other side of that is the people saying that, well, we wanna have these independent teams that are bubbling up the ideas because it's almost it's anti capitalist or anti free market to say, it's like I want my grand, my great leader to go ahead and dictate all these points there where clearly free markets bring up things that you don't expect."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things like it didn't turn out at all the way the early people thought were gonna be the key applications and things that would not have been approved by the dark cabal making the decisions about what gets into the store turn out to in some cases be extremely successful."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "So yeah, I definitely kind of wanted to be, there was a point where I did make a pitch."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "It's like, hey, make me VR dictator and I'll go in and get shit done."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "I am, and that's just, it's not in the culture at Meta."}, {"time":

fascinating because VR and we'll talk about it more."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "It's still unclear to me in what way VR will change the world because it does seem clear that VR will somehow fundamentally transform this world and it's unclear to me how yet."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "Let me know when you wanna get into that."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Who will?"}, {"time": 2578, "text":

nighters going through work for 20 hours straight."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "It's like my brain generally starts turning to mush after 12 hours or so."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "But the hard work is really important and I would work for decades."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "I would work 60 hours a week."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "I would work a 10 hour day, six days a week and try to be productive

cycling schedules where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day and roll around through the entire time and I'd wind up kind of pulling in at two or three in the afternoon sometimes and then working again past midnight or two in the morning."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "And that was, when it was just me trying to make things happen and I was usually isolated off in my office, people generally didn't bother me much at in and I could get a lot of programming work done that way."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "I did settle into a more normal schedule when I was taking kids to school and things like that."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up at the same time each day."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference in the productivity with that where I kind of feel, if I just get up when I feel like it, it's usually a little later each day but I just recently made the focusing decision to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier to getting up at eight in the morning and trying to shift things around."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "Like I'm often doing experiments with myself about what should I be doing to be more productive and one of the things that I did realize was happening in recent months where I would go for a walk or a run."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So I'm still playing with factors like this as I kind of optimize my work efforts but it's always been, it was 60 hours a week for a very long time."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming, that's fine when you're doing that but it never, you're not doing smart work much after, at least I'm not, but there's a range of people."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I mean, that's something that a lot of people don't really get in their gut where there are people that work on four hours of sleep and are smart and can continue to do good work but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So I do tell people that I always try to get eight hours of sleep."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "It's not this, you know, push yourself harder, get up earlier, I just do worse work where, you know, you can work a hundred hours a week and still get eight hours of sleep if you just kind of prioritize things correctly but I do believe in working hard, working a lot."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "And we had, I kind of came back around to that a couple of years ago where I was using the fictional example of, all right, some people say, they'll say with a straight face, they think, no, you are less productive if you work more than 40 hours a week."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "And they're generally misinterpreting things where your marginal productivity for an hour after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours but you're not literally getting less done."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "There is a point where you start breaking things and getting worse behavior and everything out of it where you're literally going backwards but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And the fictional example I would use was, imagine there's an asteroid coming to

least I believe, depending on the person, depending on the task, working more and harder will make you better for the next week in those peak hours."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "So there's something about a deep dedication to a thing that kind of gets deep in you."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "So the hard work isn't just about the raw hours of productivity, it's the thing it does to you in the weeks

for a programmer where working hard does lead to greater productivity in it."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "But it also raises the question of sort of personal relationships and all that kind of stuff,

impact me, the things that I want to do, my goals are different, and sort of the levers to impact things are different, where I have literally never felt burnout, and I know there's lots of brilliant,

my gaze to something else and have a great time working on that."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "And so much of the ability to actually work hard is the ability to have multiple things to choose from and

doesn't work for most people."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "But what I am always trying to do in those cases is I don't want to let somebody that might be a person like that be told by someone else that

debugger and you would say, well, I'm just going to change this right here."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "And yep, that did the job and fix it and go on."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "And for people who don't know, GDB is a sort of popular, I guess, Linux debugger primarily for C++."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "They handle most of the languages, but it's based on C as the original kind of Unix heritage."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And it's kind of like command line."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "It's not user friendly."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "It doesn't allow for clean visualizations and you're exactly right."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "So that you're using this kind of debugger usually when you're at what's end and there's a problem that you can't figure out why by just looking at the codes, you have to find it."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "That's how I guess normal programmers use it."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "But you're saying there should be tools that kind of visualize and help you as part of the programming process, just the normal programming process to understand the code deeper."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "Yeah, when I'm working on like my C, C++ code, I'm always running it from the debugger."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "Just I type in the code, I run it many times."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "The first thing I do after writing code is set a break point and step through the function."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Now other people will say, it's like, oh, I do that in my head."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "Well, your head is a faulty interpreter of all those things there."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "And I've written brand new code."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "I wanna step in there and I'm gonna single step through that, examine lots of things and see if it's actually doing what I expected it to."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "It is a kind of companion, the debugger."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Like you're now coding in an interactive way with another being."},

that don't like being scolded by a program for how they've written something where it's like, oh, I know better."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "And sometimes you do, but that was something that it was very, very valuable for me when, and not too many people get an opportunity like this to have."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "This is almost one of those spiritual experiences as a programmer, an awakening to, the id software code bases were a couple of million lines of code."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And at one point I had used a few of the different analysis tools, but I made a point to really go through and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "And it was eyeopening where we had a reputation for having some of the most robust, strongest code, where there were some great things that I remember hearing from Microsoft telling us about crashes on Xbox."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And we had this tiny number that they said were probably literally hardware errors."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "And then you have other significant titles that just have millions of faults that are getting recorded all the time."}, {"time": 3784, "text": "So

you can say, okay, this was a copy paste, not changing something right here."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "Lots of things that were, the most common problem was something in a printf format string that was the wrong data type that could cause crashes there."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And you really want the warnings for things like that."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Then the next most common was missing a check for null that could actually happen, that could blow things up."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And those are obviously like top C, C++ things."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "Everybody has those problems."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "But the long tail of all of the different little things that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers and my own code, stuff that I'd be looking at,

dictatorial rule of like, this should be true at this point."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "And too many times I've made mistakes that shouldn't have been made."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "And I would assume I wouldn't be the kind of person that would make that mistake, but I keep making that mistake."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "Therefore, an assert really catches me, really helps all the time."},

will never fire."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "But even if you have it right and you wrote the code right initially, then circumstances change."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "The world outside your program changes."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "And in fact, that's one of the things where I'm kind of fond in a lot of cases of static array size declarations, where I went through this period where it's like, okay, now we have general collection classes."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "We should just make everything variable because I had this history of in the early days, you get doom, which had some fixed limits on it."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "Then everybody started making crazier and crazier things."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "And they kept bumping up the different limits, this many lines, this many sectors."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And it seemed like a good idea, well, we should just make this completely generic."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "It can go kind of go up to whatever."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "And there's cases where that's the right thing to do, but it also, the other aspect of the world changing around you is it's good to be informed when the world has changed more than you thought it would."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And if you've got a continuously growing collection, you're never gonna find out."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "You might have this quadratic slow down on something where you thought, oh, I'm only ever gonna have a handful of these, but something changes and there's a new design style."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "And all of a sudden you've got 10,000 of them."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "So I kind of like in many cases, picking a number, some nice brown power of two number and setting it up in there and having an assert saying, it's like, hey, you hit this limit."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "You should probably think are the choices that you've made around all of this still relevant if somebody's using 10 times more than you thought they would."},

way."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink the initial stuff."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And it's nice for it to do that."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "Is there any stuff like a keyboard or monitors?"}, {"time": 4101, "text": "I'm a fairly pedestrian on a lot of that where I did move to triple monitors like in the last several years ago."}, {"time": 4107, "text":

week on it."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "I used Anki to like teach myself the different little key combinations for things like that."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And in the end, it was just like, all right, this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase."}, {"time": 4168, "text": "It's like, I'm going out there doing it like they used to in the old days."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And it was kind of fun in that regard."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "So many people right now."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "They're screaming as they're listening to this."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim, but still, yes, I was very happy to get back to my visual studio at the end."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "Yeah, I'm actually, I struggle with this a lot because I use a Kinesis keyboard and I use Emacs primarily."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "And I feel like I can, exactly as you said, I can understand the code."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "I can navigate the code."},

better ideas are constantly being built."}, {"time": 4221, "text": "And that puts a kind of, I need to take the same kind of retreat as you're talking about, but now I'm still fighting the civil war."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "I need to kind of move into the 21st century."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And it does seem like the world is, or a large chunk of the world is moving towards visual

still uses visual studio six."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And on a modern computer, everything is just absolutely instant on something like that, because it was made to work on a computer that's 10,000

like, oh, why is this refreshing the screen and moving around and updating over here?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And something blinks down there and you should update this."}, {"time": 4281, "text":

still continue to play a role?"}, {"time": 4315, "text": "Back in the early, early days of id Software, one of our big things that was unique with what we did is I had adopted next stations or kind of next step systems from Steve Jobs's out in the woods away from Apple company."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And they were basically, it was kind of interesting because I did not really have a background with the Unix system."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So many of the people they get immersed in that in college and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "And I didn't have any of that, but I knew that my background was, I was a huge Apple II fan boy."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "I was always a little suspicious of the Mac."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "I was not really what kind of I wanted to go with."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started Next, this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things from the future where it had all of this cool stuff in it."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "And we were still back in those days working on DOS, everything blew up."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "You had reset buttons because your computer would just freeze."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "If you're doing development work, literally dozens of times a day, your computer was just rebooting constantly."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "And so this idea of, yes, any of the Unix workstations would have given a stable development platform where you don't crash and reboot all the time."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "But Next also had this really amazing graphical interface and it was great for building tools."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "And it used Objective C as kind of an interesting dead end for things like that."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "So Next was Unix based, it said Objective C. So it has a lot of the elements."}, {"time": 4407, "text": "That became Mac."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "I mean, the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by Next where that took over and became what the modern Mac system is."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "And to find some of the developer, like the tools and the whole community."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Yeah, you've still got, if you're programming on Apple stuff now, there's still all these NS somethings, which was originally Next step objects of different kinds of things."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "But one of the aspects of those Unix systems was they had this notion of a.plan file where a.file is an invisible file."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "Usually in your home directory or something."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "And there was a trivial server running on most Unix systems at the time that when somebody ran a trivial little command called finger, you could do finger and then somebody's address, it could be anywhere on the internet if you were connected correctly."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "Then all that server would do was read the.plan file in that user's home directory and then just spit it out to you."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "And originally the idea was that could be whether you're on vacation, what your current project was."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "It's supposed to be like the plan of what you're doing."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "And people would use it for various purposes, but all it did was dump that file over to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "And at one point I started just keeping a list of what I was doing in there, which would be what I was working on in the day."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "And I would have this little syntax."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "I kind of got to myself about, here's something that I'm working on."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "I put a star when I finish it."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I could have a few other little bits of punctuation."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And at the time it was, it started off as being just like my to do list."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And it would be these trivial, obscure little things like I fixed something with collision detection code, made Fireball do something different and just little one liners that people that were following the games could kind of decipher."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "But I did wind up starting to write much more in depth things."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "I would have little notes of thoughts and insights and then I would eventually start having little essays."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "But it was interesting enough that there were a lot of people that were interested in this."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So most of the people didn't have Unix workstation."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So there were the websites back in the day that would follow the Doom and Quake development that would basically make a little service that would go grab all the changes and then people could just get it with a web browser."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And there was a period where like all of the little kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people that were at all in that orbit, there were a couple dozen plan files going on, which was, and this was some years before blogging really became kind of a thing."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "And it was kind of a premonition of sort of the way things would go."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "And there was, it's all been collected."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "It's available online in different places."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "And it's kind of fun to go back and look through what I was thinking, what I was doing in the different areas."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "Have you had a chance to look back?"}, {"time": 4593, "text": "Is there some interesting, very low level specific to do items, maybe things you've never completed, all that kind of stuff and high level philosophical essay type of stuff that stands out?"}, {"time": 4606, "text": "Yeah, there's some good stuff on both where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details about game dev and I've learned enough things where there's no project that I worked on that I couldn't go back and do a better job on now."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "I mean, you just, you learn things, hopefully if you're doing it right, you learn things as you get older and you should be able to do a better job at all of the early things."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And there's stuff in Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like, oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this, whether it's something in the rendering engine side or how I implemented the monster behaviors or managed resources or anything like that."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?"}, {"time": 4644, "text": "Like looking back?"}, {"time": 4647, "text": "I mean, sometimes I'll get the, I'll look at it and say, yeah, I had a pretty clear view of I was doing good work there."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "And I haven't really hit the point where there was another programmer, Graham Devine, who was, he had worked at ID and Seventh Guest and he made some comment one time where he said he looked back at some of his old notes and he was like, wow, I was really smart back then."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "And I don't hit that so much where, I mean, I look at it and I always know that, yeah, there's all the, you know, with aging, you get certain changes in how you're able to work problems, but all of the problems that I've worked, I'm sure that I could do a better job on all of them."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "So you can still step right in."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy, you would teach him a few things."}, {"time": 4695, "text": "What about the high level philosophical stuff?"}, {"time": 4698, "text": "Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?"}, {"time": 4700, "text": "There's things that I was understanding about development and, you know, in the industry and so on that were in a more primitive stage where I definitely learned a lot more in the later years about business and organization and team structure."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "There were, I mean, there were definitely things that I was not the best person or even a very good person about managing, like how a team should operate internally, how people should work together."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "I was just, you know, just get out of my way and let me work on the code and do this."}, {"time": 4739, "text": "And more and more, I've learned how, in the larger scheme of things, how sometimes relatively unimportant some of those things are,

you know, my earlier years."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "And there's things that, you know, I could have gotten more out of people handling things in different ways."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "I am, you know, I could have made, you know, in some ways more successful products by following things in different ways."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "There's mistakes that we made that we couldn't really have known how things would have worked out, but it was interesting to see in later years companies like Activision showing that, hey, you really can just do the same game, make it better every year."},

say, it's like, no, are the people buying it still enjoying it?"}, {"time": 4795, "text": "Are they enjoying it more than what they might have bought otherwise?"}, {"time": 4799, "text": "And you can say, no, that's actually a great value creation engine to do that if you're in a position where you can."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "I, you know, don't be forced into reinventing everything just because you think that you need to."}, {"time": 4812, "text": "You know, lots of things about business and team stuff that could be done better, but the technical work, the kind of technical visionary

on it now, that fight to keep OpenGL relevant for a number of years there meant that OpenGL was there when mobile started happening and OpenGL ES was the thing that drove all of the acceleration of

devices wound up with an appropriate capable graphics API due in no small part to me thinking that that was really important that we not just give up and use Microsoft's at that time really terrible API."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay terrible."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "They were terrible at the start, but a few versions on, they were actually quite good."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "And there was a completely fair argument to be made that by the time DX9 was out, it was probably a better programming environment than OpenGL, but it was still a wonderful good thing that we had an open standard that could show up on Linux and Android and iOS and eventually WebGL still to this day."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "So that was one, that would be on my greatest hits list of things that I kind of pushed with."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "The impact it had on billions of devices, yes."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "Can you tell the origin story of id

thing that made me realize what computers are capable of in terms of graphics, in terms of performance, it just unlocked something deep in me and understanding what these machines are all about as games can do that."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "So Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake, and just all the incredible engineering innovation that went into that."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So how did it all start?"}, {"time": 4964, "text": "So I'll caveat upfront that I usually don't consider myself the historian of the software side of things."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "I usually do kind of point people at John Romero for stories about the early days where I've never been, like I've commented that I'm a remarkably unsentimental person in some ways where I don't really spend a lot of time unless I'm explicitly prodded to go back and think about the early days of things."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "And I didn't necessarily make the effort to archive everything exactly in my brain."}, {"time": 4997,

5005, "text": "But having said all of that, from my view, the way everything happened that led up to that was after I was an adult and kind of taking a few college classes and deciding to drop out, I was doing, I was hardscrabble contract programming work, really struggling to kind of keep groceries and pay my rent and things."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "And the company that I was doing the most work for was a company called Softdisk Publishing, which had the sounds bizarre now business model of monthly subscription software."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "Before there was an internet that people could connect to and get software, you would pay a certain amount and every month they would send you a disc that had some random software on it."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "And people that were into

things that I was doing again to keep my head above water here was I decided that I could make one program and I could port it to multiple systems."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "So I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs and I would develop it on the Apple II, the 2GS and the IBM PC, which apparently was the thing that really kind of piqued the attention of the people working down there."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Like Jay Wilbur was my primary editor and Tom Hall was a secondary editor."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "And they kept asking me, it's like, hey, you should come down

barely getting by, I loved it."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "I was doing nothing but programming all day, but I did have enough close scrapes with like, damn, I'm just really out of money that maybe I should get an actual job rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "And Jay Wilbur was great."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "I had to kind of get over whatever hump I was at."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So I took the, I finally took them up on their offer to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "I was in Kansas city at the time, drove down to through the Ozarks and everything down to Louisiana and saw the soft disk offices, went through, talked to a bunch of people, met the people I had been working with remotely at that time."}, {"time": 5157, "text": "But the most important thing for me was I met two programmers there, John Romero

"But all I had to learn from was these few books at the library."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "It was not much at all."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "And there were some aspects of programming that were kind of black magic to me."}, {"time": 5187, "text": "Like, it's like, oh, he knows how to format a track on, I am on a low level drive programming interface."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "And this was, I was still not at all sure I was gonna take the job, but I met these awesome programmers that were doing cool stuff."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "And Romero had worked at Origin Systems and he had done like, so many different games ahead of time that I did kind of quickly decide, it's like, yeah, I'll go take the job down there."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "And I settled down there, moved in and started working on more little projects."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "And the first kind of big change that happened down there was the company wanted to make a gaming focused, a PC gaming focused

or two games just every month and no choice in what you get, but we think it'll be fun."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And that was the model they were comfortable with and they said, all right, we're gonna start this gamers edge department."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "And all of us that were interested in that, like me, Romero, Tom Hall was kind of helping us from his side of things, Jay would peek in and we had a few other programmers working with us at the time."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "And we were going to just start making games, just the same model."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And we dived in and it was fantastic."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "Do you have to make new games?"}, {"time": 5270, "text": "And this, in retrospect, looking back at it, that sense that I had done all this contract programming and John Romero had done like far more of this where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "It's that sense of like, I'm just gonna go make 26 different games, give them a different theme."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "And you learn so much when you go through and you crank these things out like on a biweekly, monthly basis, something like that."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "From start to finish."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "It's not like just an idea."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "It's not just from

opportunity to craft all of their skills before they were famous, that was very critical to their later successes."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And I think there's a lot of that here where we did these games that nobody remembers, lots of little things that contributed to building up the skillset for the things that eventually did make us famous."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "Yeah, Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "I had to write it in a month, just to make money."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "And nobody remembers that probably because he had to figure out, because it's literally, he didn't have enough time to write it fast enough."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "So he had to come up with hacks."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Literally, it again comes down to that point where pressure and limitation of resources is surprisingly important."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And it's counterintuitive in a lot of ways where you just think that if you've got all the time in the world and you've got all the resources in the world, of course, you're gonna get something better."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "But sometimes it really does work out that the innovations, mother necessity,

games written in that time?"}, {"time": 5392, "text": "Would you say?"}, {"time": 5393, "text": "Some of them are still fun to go back and play where you get the, they were all about kind of, the more modern term is game feel, about how just the exact feel that things, it's not the grand strategy of the design, but how running and jumping and shooting and those things I feel in the moment."},

move over and you're like, bang, jump, bang."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "It's like, hey, that's kind of cool still."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "So you can get lost in the rhythm of the game."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "Is that what you mean by feel?"}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Just like there's something about it that pulls you in?"}, {"time": 5431, "text": "Nowadays, again, people talk about

of ways, but there are better and worse ways to do all of them."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "And we did so many of these games that we got a lot of practice with it."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "So one of the kind of weird things that was happening at this time is John Romero was getting some strange fan mail."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And back in the days, this was before email."}, {"time": 5469,

directly, that he would get intercepted."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "So he was trying to get him to contact him through like back channel fan mail, because he basically was saying, hey, I'm making all this money on shareware games."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "I want you to make shareware games, because he had seen some of the games that Romero had done."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And we looked at Scott Miller's games and we didn't think they were very good."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "We're like, that can't be making the kind of money that he's saying he's making 10 grand or something off of this game."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "And we really thought that he was full of shit, that it was a lie trying to get him into this."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "But so that was kind of going on at one level."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "And it was funny the moment when Romero realized that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall, like all of his fans."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And then we

before him."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident with that was I was working on a lot of the new technologies where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time, where I was really a long hold out on Apple II forever."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "And I loved my Apple II."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "It was the computer I always wished I had when I was growing up."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And when I finally did have one, I was kind of clinging on to that well past it sort of good use by day."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "Is it the best computer ever made you would you say?"}, {"time": 5570, "text": "I wouldn't make judgments like that about it, but it was positioned in such a way, especially in the school systems that it impacted a whole lot of

the total focus because I had moved to another city where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "I had a little apartment and then at Softdisk, again, the things that drew me to it, I had a couple of programmers that knew more than I did and they had a library."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "They had a set of books and a set of magazines."}, {"time": 5626, "text": "They had a couple of years of magazines, the old Dr. Dobbs journal and all of these magazines that had information about things."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "And so I was just in total immersion mode."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming, particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "And I was digging into a lot of these low level hardware details that people weren't usually paying attention to, the way the IBM EGA cards worked, which was fun for me."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "I hadn't had experience with things at that level."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And back then you could get hardware documentation just down at the register levels."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "This is where the CRTC register is."},

copy of Turbo Pascal."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And so I had a hard one week and this was cutting into what minimal profit margin I had there."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "But I had this computer for a week."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "I had to get my program ported before I had to return the PC and that was kind of what the first thing that I had done on the IBM PC and what led me to taking the job

one of these great examples where Pascal was an academic language and you had things like the UCSDP system that Wizardry was actually written in that they did manage to make a game with that, but it

ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster than most other compilers at the time."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "But it also had very pragmatic access to look, you can just poke at the hardware in these different ways and we have libraries that let you do things."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "And it was a pretty good, it was a perfectly good way to write games and this is one of those things where people have talked about different paths that computer development could have taken where C took over the world for reasons that came out of Unix and eventually Linux."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "And that was not a foregone conclusion at all."}, {"time": 5947, "text": "And people can make real reasoned rational arguments that the world might've been better if it had gone a Pascal route."}, {"time": 5954,

of abstraction."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "It was a systems programming language, but."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "But you said Pascal had a more emphasis on data structures."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "I actually, in the tree of languages, did Pascal come before C?"}, {"time": 5988, "text": "They were pretty contemporaneous."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "So Pascal's lineage went to Modula 2 and

classic academic oriented Pascals were just missing fundamental things like, oh, you can't access this core system thing because we're just using it to teach students."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it really did make it a completely capable language."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "And it had some reasons why you could implement it as a single pass

"And what I had come across was a couple of different techniques for implementing that on the PC."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "And they're not hard, complicated things."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "When I explain them now, they're pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "But just nobody was doing it."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "You sound like Einstein describing his five papers is pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "But they're nevertheless revolutionary."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So side scrolling is a game changer."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "Yeah, and scrolling is a genius invention."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "It's either vertical."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And some of the consoles had different limitations about you could do one but not the other."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And there were similar things going on as advancements, even in the console space, where you'd have the original Mario game was just horizontal scrolling."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And then later, Mario games added vertical aspects to it and different things that you were doing to explore, kind of expand the capabilities there."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "And so much of the early game design for decades was removing limitations, letting you do things that you envisioned as a designer, you wanted the player to experience, but the hardware just couldn't really or you didn't know how to make it happen."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "It felt impossible."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "You can imagine that you want to create like this big world through which you can side scroll, like through which you can walk."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And then you ask yourself a question, how do I actually build that in a way that's like the latency is low enough, the hardware can actually deliver that in such a way that it's a compelling experience."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do because we were playing all of these console games, playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "Clearly, there was a whole world of awesome things there that we just couldn't do on the PC, at least initially."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "Because every programmer can tell, it's like if you want to scroll, you can just redraw the whole screen."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "But then it turns out, well, you're going five frames per second."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "That's not an interactive fun experience."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "You want to be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "And it just didn't feel like that was possible."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster for you to make a playable game there."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And interestingly, I wound up with two completely different solutions for the scrolling problem."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "And this is a theme that runs through everything, where all of these big technical advancements, it turns out there's always a couple different ways of doing them."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "But so the scrolling, the first set of scrolling tricks that I got was the hardware had this ability to, you could shift inside the window of memory."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format, where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors, you had 16 colors, which is four bits."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "So you had four bit planes, 64k a piece."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Of course, 64k is a nice round number for 16 bit addressing."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "So your graphics card had a 16 bit window that you could look at."}, {"time": 6315, "text": "And you could tell it to start the video scan out anywhere inside there."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "So there were a couple games that had taken this approach of you could make a 2 by 2 screen or a 1 by 4 screen."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "And you could do scrolling really easily like that."}, {"time": 6328, "text": "You could just lay it all out and just pan around there."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "But you just couldn't make it any bigger because that's all the memory that was there."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "The first insight to the scrolling that I had was, well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger, and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels, the little classic Mario block that you run into, lots of art gets drawn that way."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "And your screen is a certain number of tiles."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "But if you had one little buffer region outside of that, you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "That could be perfectly smooth."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "But then what happens if you get to the edge and you want to keep going?"}, {"time": 6365, "text": "The first way we did scrolling was what I called adaptive tile refresh, which was really just a matter of you get to the edge and then you go back to the original point and then only change the tiles that have actually that are different between where it was."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "In most of the games at the time, if you think about your classic Super Mario Brothers game, you've got big fields of blue sky, long rows of the same brick texture."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "And there's a lot of commonality."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "It's like a data compression thing."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "If you take the screen and you set it down on top of each other, in general, only about 10% of the tiles were actually different there."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "So this was a way to go ahead and say, well, I'm going to move it back, and then I'm only going to change those 10%, 20%, whatever percent tiles there."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "And that meant that it was essentially five times faster than if you were redrawing all of the tiles."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And that worked well enough for us to do a bunch of these games for Gamer's Edge."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "We had a lot of these scrolling games like Slurred Axe and Shadow Knights and things like that that we were cranking out at this high rate that had this scrolling effect on it."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "And it worked well enough."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "There were design challenges there where if you made the worst case, if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen, you scroll over one and every single tile changes and your frame rate's now five frames per second because it had to redraw everything."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "So the designers had a little bit that they had to worry about."}, {"time": 6449, "text": "They had to make these relatively plain looking levels, but it was still pretty magical."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "It was something that we hadn't seen before."}, {"time": 6457, "text": "And the first thing that we wound up doing with that was I had just gotten this working, and Tom Hall was sitting there with me, and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo on the side there with Super Mario 3 running."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "And we had the technology, we had the tools set up there, and we stayed up all night."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "And we basically cloned the first level of Super Mario Brothers."}, {"time": 6481, "text": "Performance wise as well?"}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And we had our little character running and jumping in there."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "It was close to pixel accurate as far as all the backgrounds and everything, but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together from previous games that I had written."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "I just really kitbashed the whole thing together to make this demo."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "And that was one of the rare cases when I said I don't usually do these all night programming things."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "There's probably only two memorable ones that I can think about."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "One was the all nighter to go ahead and get our Dangerous Dave and copyright infringement is how we titled it."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave running around with a shotgun shooting things, and we were just taking our most beloved game at the time there, the Super Mario 3, and sticking Dave inside that with this new scrolling technology that was going perfectly smooth for them as it ran."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "And Tom and I just blearily the next morning left, and we left a disk on the desk for John Romero and Jay Wilbur to see and just said, run this."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "And we eventually made it back in later in the day, and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And that was the point where they were like, we got to do something with this."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "We're going to make a company."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "We're going to go make our own games, where this was something that we were able to just kind of hit them with a hammer of an experience like, wow, this is just like so much cooler than what we thought was possible there."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "And initially, we tried to get Nintendo to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "That's really what we wanted to do."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "We were like, hey, we can finish this."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "It's line of sight."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "And we sent something to Nintendo, and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan, and they just weren't interested in that."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "But that's another one of those life could have gone a very different way, where we could have been like Nintendo's house PC team at that point."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "And define the direction of Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake could have been a Nintendo creation."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "So at the same time that we were just doing our first scrolling demos, we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said, it's like, hey, we do want to make some games."},

amazing."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And he just popped right up and sent a check to us, where at that point, we still thought he might be a fraud, that he was just lying about all of this."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "But he was totally correct on how much money he was making with his shareware titles."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "And this was his real brainstorm about this, where shareware was this idea that software doesn't have a fixed price."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart some money to the creator."}, {"time": 6651, "text": "And there were a couple of utilities that did make some significant success like that."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "But for the most part, it didn't really work."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Now, there wasn't much software in a pure shareware model that was successful."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "The Apogee innovation was to take something, call it shareware, split it into three pieces."}, {"time": 6670, "text":

part was a demo, where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free and you paid money to get the whole set."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "But it was still play to shareware."}, {"time": 6688,

enough to hand write out a check and put it in an envelope and address it and send it out to Apogee to get the rest of them."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "So it was a really pretty feel good business

that model still brought joy to so many people."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "The 20X people that played it."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "I felt very good about that."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "I would run

a new game for Apogee at the same time."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And this eventually did lead to some legal problems."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "And we had trouble."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It all got worked out in the end, but it was not a good call at the time there."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "And your legal mind at the time was not stellar."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "You were not thinking in

think we were gonna get away with even using our work computers to write software for our breakaway new company?"}, {"time": 6896, "text": "It was not a good plan."}, {"time": 6898, "text": "How did Commander Keen come to be?"}, {"time": 6900, "text": "So the design process, we would start from, we had some idea of what we wanted to do."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "We wanted to do a Mario like game."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "It was gonna be a side scroller."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "It was gonna use the technology."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "We had some sense of what it would have to look like because of the limitations of this adaptive tile refresh technology."}, {"time": 6917, "text": "It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "You couldn't just paint up a background and then move that around."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "The early design or all the design for Commander Keen really came from Tom Hall, where he was kind of the main creative mind for the early id software stuff, where we had an interesting division of things where Tom was all creative and design."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "I was all programming."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "John Romero was an interesting bridge where he was both a very good programmer and also a very good designer and artist and kind of straddled between the areas."}, {"time": 6952, "text": "But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And he came up with all the design and backstory for the different things of kind of a mad scientist, little kid with building a rocket ship and a zap gun and visiting alien worlds and doing all of this that the background that we lay the game inside of."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "And there's not a whole lot to any of these things."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "Design for us was always just what we needed to do to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "And we laid out our first trilogy of games, the shareware formula, it's gonna be three pieces."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "We make Commander Keen one, two, and three."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And we just really started busting on all that work."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And it went together really quickly."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "It was like three months or something that while we were still making games every month for Gamer's Edge, we were sharing technology between that."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "I'd write a bunch of code for this and we'd just kind of use it for both."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "Again, not a particularly good idea there that had consequences for us."}, {"time": 7013, "text": "But in three months, we got our first game out and all of a sudden it was three times as successful as the most successful thing Apogee had had before."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "And we were making like $30,000 a month immediately from the Commander Keen stuff."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And that was again, a surprise to us."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "It was more than we thought that that was gonna make."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "And we said, well, we're gonna certainly roll into another set of titles from this."}, {"time": 7039, "text": "And in that three months, I had come up with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology that was not the adaptive tile refresh, which in some ways was even simpler."}, {"time": 7049, "text": "And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology are things that are back of the envelope designs."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "I make this comment about modern machine learning where all the things that are really important practically in the last decade are, each of them fits on the back of an envelope."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "There are these simple little things."}, {"time": 7066, "text": "They're not super dense, hard to understand technologies."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like, okay, we know we've got this 64K window."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "And the question was always like, well, you could make a two by two, but you can't go off the edge."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "But I finally asked, well, what actually happens if you just go off the edge?"}, {"time": 7089, "text": "If you take your start and you say, it's like, okay, I can move over, I'm scrolling, I can move over, I can move down, I'm scrolling."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "It's like, well, what if I just keep going?"}, {"time": 7101, "text": "And I say, I'm gonna start at, what happens if I start at FFFE at the very end of the 64K block?"}, {"time": 7109, "text": "And it turns out it just wraps back around to the top of the block."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "And I'm like, oh, well, this makes everything easy."}, {"time": 7115, "text": "You can just scroll the screen everywhere and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles, which everything you expose, it might be unaligned off various parts of the screen memory, but it just works."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "That no longer had the problem of you had to have fields of the similar colors because it doesn't matter what you're doing, you could be having a completely unique world and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes on."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "But it might be, like you said, unaligned, so it can be all over the place."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "Yes, and it turns out it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 7144, "text": "I would have two page flipped screens, as long as they didn't overlap, they moved in series through this two dimensional window of graphics."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "This just works, it's faster, there it seemed like there was no downside."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "Funny thing was, it turned out after we shipped titles with this, there were what they called super VGA cards, the cards that would allow higher resolutions and different features that the standard ones didn't."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "And on some of those cards, this was a weird compatibility quirk again, because nobody thought this was not what it was designed to do."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "And some of those cards had more memory."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "They had more than just 256K and four planes."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "They had 512K or a megabyte."}, {"time": 7191, "text": "And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down and then it goes into uninitialized memory that actually exists there rather than wrapping back around at the top."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "And then I was in the tough position of do I have to track every single one of these?"}, {"time": 7206, "text": "And it was a mad house back then with there were 20 different video card vendors with all slightly different implementations of their nonstandard functionality."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "So either I needed to natively program all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory and keep scrolling down through all of that, or I kind of punted and took the easy solution of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen, I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "In the normal ones, when it all worked fine, everything was just beautifully smooth."}, {"time": 7242, "text": "But if you had one of those cards where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to, you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around, and then eventually you'd have a little hitch where 200 milliseconds or something that was not super smooth as it froze a little bit."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "And this is the binary thing."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "Is it one of the standard screens or is it one of the weird ones, the Super VGA ones?"}, {"time": 7263, "text": "And so we would default to, and I think that was one of those that changed over the kind of course of deployment where early on we would have a normal mode and then you would enable the compatibility flag if your screen did this crazy flickery thing when you got to a certain point in the game."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default as just more and more of the cards kind of did not do exactly the right thing."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "And that's the two edged sword of doing unconventional things with technology where you can find something that nobody thought about doing that kind of scrolling trick when they set up those cards."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason when I was relying on that, then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "Let me take a bit of a tangent, but ask you about the hacker ethic."}, {"time": 7310, "text": "Cause you mentioned shareware."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "It's an interesting world."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "The world of people that make money, the business and the people that build systems, the engineers."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "And what is the hacker ethic?"}, {"time": 7325, "text": "You've been a man of the people and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "What did it mean to you at the time?"}, {"time": 7334, "text": "What does it mean to you today?"}, {"time": 7335, "text": "So Steven Levy's book, Hackers, was a really formative book for me as a teenager."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "I mean, I read it several times and there was all of the great lore of the early MIT era of hackers and ending up at the end with, it kind of went through the early MIT hackers and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers and then the game hackers in part three."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And at that time as a teenager, I really was kind of bitter in some ways."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "I thought I was born too late."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "I thought I missed the window there."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "And I

Garriott."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "And it's like, I really wanted to be there."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "And I knew that was now a few years in the past."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "It was not to be, but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days, talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic, that there was this sense that it was about sharing information, being good, not keeping it to yourself, and that it's not a zero sum game, that you can share something with another programmer and it doesn't take it away from you."}, {"time": 7410, "text": "You then have somebody else doing something."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "And I also think that there's an aspect of it where it's this ability to take joy in other people's accomplishments, where it's not the cutthroat bit of like, I have to be first, I have to be recognized as the one that did this in some way, but being able to see somebody else do something and say, holy shit, that's amazing."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing that somebody else does."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "And the big thing that I was able to do through ID Software was this ability to eventually release the source code for most of our, like all of our really seminal game titles."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "And that was a, it was a stepping stone process where we were kind of surprised early on where people were able to hack the existing games."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And of course I had experience with that."}, {"time": 7461, "text": "I remember hacking my copies of Ultima."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "So I'd give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels and break out the sector editor."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And so I was familiar with all of that."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "So it was just, it was with a smile when I started to see people doing that to our games, I am making level editors for Commander Keen or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D, but I made the pitch internally that we should actually release our own tools for like what we did, what we use to create the games."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "And that was a little bit debatable about, well, will this let other, we'll give people leg up."}, {"time": 7497, "text": "It's always like, what's that gonna mean for the competition?"}, {"time": 7500, "text": "But the really hard pitch was to actually release the full source code for the games."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And it was a balancing act with the other people inside the company where it's interesting how the programmers generally did get, certainly the people that I worked closely with, they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit where you wanted to share your code."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "You were proud of it."}, {"time": 7525, "text": "You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "But interestingly, the broader game industry is a little more hesitant to embrace that than like the group of people that we happen to have at id Software, where it was always a little interesting to me seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community were very possessive of their code."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "They did not wanna share their code."}, {"time": 7549, "text": "They wanted it to be theirs."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "It was their claim to fame."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "And that was much more like what we tended to see with artists where the artists understand something about credit and wanting it to be known as their work."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "And a lot of the game programmers felt a little bit more like artists than like hacker programmers, in that it was about building something that maybe felt more like art to them than the more tool based and exploration based kind of hacking culture side of things."}, {"time": 7579, "text": "Yeah, it's so interesting that this kind of fear that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot because I try not to go..."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "I mean, it's easy for me to say because so much credit is heaped on me for the id Software side of things."}, {"time": 7599, "text": "But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight and say, no, it's like that wasn't where first person gaming came from and you can point to some of like things on obscure titles that I was never aware of or like the old Playdoh systems or each personal computer had something that was 3Dish and moving around."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And I'm happy to say it's like, no, I mean, I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "I had seen 3D graphics, I had seen all these things that are standing on the shoulders of lots of other people."}, {"time": 7629, "text": "But sometimes these examples they pull out, it's like, no, I didn't know that existed."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "I mean, I had never heard of that before then that didn't contribute to what I made, but there's plenty of stuff that did."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And I think there's good cases to be made that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein were formative examples for what everything that came after that."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "But I don't feel the need to go fight and say claim primacy or initial invention of anything like that."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "But a lot of people do want to."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "I think when you fight for the credit in that way and it does go against the hacker ethic, you destroy something fundamental about the culture, about the community that builds cool stuff."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "I think credit ultimately, so I had this sort of, there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling called Buvai Sarasateeva."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "And he always preached that you should just focus on the art of the wrestling and let people write your story however they want."}, {"time": 7695, "text": "The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "And that is something about the hacker ethic is just focus on building cool stuff, sharing it with other cool people, and credit will get assigned correctly in the long arc of history."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "Yeah, and I generally think that's true."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "And you've got, there's some things, there's a graphics technique that got labeled CarMax Reverse."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "I am literally named, and it turned out that I wasn't the first person to figure that out."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "Most scientific things or mathematical things you wind up, it's like, oh, this other person had actually done that somewhat before."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "And then there's things that get attributed to me like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn't do."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "I flat out, that wasn't me."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "And it's like, it's weird how the memetic power of the internet, I cannot convince people of that."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "You're like the Mark Twain of programming."}, {"time": 7752, "text": "Everything just gets attributed to you now, even though you've never sought the credit of things."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "But part of the fact of the humility behind that is what attracts the attributions."}, {"time": 7765, "text": "Let's talk about a game."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "I mean, one of the greatest games ever made."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on, but to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "It blew my mind that a world like this could exist."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be in terms of the programming, in terms of the design, in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?"}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And also, actually just something you haven't mentioned is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind, the adaptive side scrolling, the solutions to these technical challenges?"}, {"time": 7803, "text": "So I usually can introspectively pull back pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions and design choices on my part came to be, where technically we had done two games, 3D games like that before, where Hover Tank was the first one, which had flat shaded walls, but did have the scaled enemies inside it."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "And then Catacombs 3D, which had textured walls, scaled enemies, and some more functionality, like the disappearing walls and some other stuff."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "But what's really interesting from a game development standpoint is those games, Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein, they literally used the same code for a lot of the character behavior that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did, where it was an overhead view game, kind of like Gauntlet, you're running around and you can open up doors, pick up items, basic game stuff."}, {"time": 7861, "text": "And the thought was that this exact same game experience just presented in a different perspective."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "It could be literally the same game just with a different view into it, would have a dramatically different impact on the players."}, {"time": 7876, "text": "So it wasn't a true 3D, you're saying that you could kind of fake it, you can like scale enemies, meaning things that are farther away, you can make them smaller."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "So the game was a 2D map, like all of our games use the same tool for creation."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "We use the same map editor for creating Keen as Wolfenstein and Hover Tank and Catacombs and all this stuff."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "And you could say, well, these are walls, these are where the enemies start, then they start moving around."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "And these early games like Catacombs, you played it strictly in a 2D view."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "It was a scrolling 2D view, and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh at the time to be able to do something like that."}, {"time": 7918, "text": "And then the thought that these early games, all it did was take the same basic enemy logic, but instead of seeing it from the God's eye view on top, you were inside it and turning from side to side, yawing your view and moving forwards and backwards and side to side."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "And it's a striking thing where you always talk about wanting to isolate and factor changes in values."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "And this was one of those most pure cases there where the rest of the game changed very little."}, {"time": 7945, "text": "It was our normal kind of change the colors on something and draw a different picture for it, but it's kind of the same thing."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "And it was dramatically different."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian, that had been drawing the pictures for it."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D, and we had these walls that you could get a key and you could make the blocks disappear, get really simple stuff."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "Blocks could either be there or not there."}, {"time": 7972, "text": "So our idea of a door was being able to make a set of blocks just disappear."}, {"time": 7977, "text": "And I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "It was all still keyboard."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "And he practically fell out of his chair."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "It was just like, ah!"}, {"time": 7999, "text": "And games just didn't do that."}, {"time": 8002, "text": "The games were the God's eye view."}, {"time": 8004, "text": "You were a little invested in your little guy."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "You can be like happy or sad when things happen, but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "You weren't inside the game."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened."}, {"time": 8019, "text": "And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is gonna make a difference."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?"}, {"time": 8031, "text": "So not that exact thing."}, {"time": 8033, "text": "So again, we had cases like the arcade games, Battle Zone and Star Wars that you could kind of see a 3D world and things coming at you and you get some sense of it, but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing and the sort of action based things."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "3D at the time was really largely about the simulation thoughts."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "And this is something that really might have trended differently if not for the id Software approach in the games where there were flight simulators, there were driving simulators, you had like hard drive in and Microsoft flight simulator."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D in ways that were more flexible than what we were doing with our games, but they were looked at as simulations."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers because they were trying to simulate reality and they were taking their cues from the big systems, the Evans and Sutherlands and the Silicon Graphics that were doing things."}, {"time": 8092, "text": "But we were taking our cues from the console and arcade games."}, {"time": 8096, "text": "We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters that were doing fast paced things that you could smack you around rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "Quarter eaters."}, {"time": 8108, "text": "And you know, a funny thing is, so much that that built into us that Wolfenstein still had lives and you had like one of the biggest power ups in all these games like was an extra life because you started off with three lives and you lose your lives and then it's game over and there weren't save games in most of this stuff."}, {"time": 8126, "text": "It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this, but it was an innovation in Doom to not have lives."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "You know, you could just play Doom as long as you wanted."}, {"time": 8133, "text": "You just restart at the start of the level and why not?"}, {"time": 8136, "text": "This is like, we aren't trying to take people's quarters."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "They've already paid for the entire game."}, {"time": 8141, "text": "We want them to have a good time and you would have some, you know, some old timer purists that might think that there's something to the epic journey of making it to the end, having to restart all the way from the beginning after a certain number of tries."}, {"time": 8153, "text": "But now more fun is had when you just let people kind of keep trying when they're stuck rather than having to go all the way back and learn different things."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "So you've recommended the book, Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D for technical exploration of the game."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "So looking back 30 years, what are some memorable technical innovations that made this perspective shift into this world that's so immersive that scares you when a monster appears or some things you have to solve?"}, {"time": 8182, "text": "So one of the interesting things that come back to the theme of deadlines and resource constraints, the game Catacombs 3D, we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped."}, {"time": 8196, "text": "I was actually late."}, {"time": 8197, "text": "It slipped like six weeks because this was texture mapped walls doing stuff that I hadn't done before."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And at the six week point, it was still kind of glitchy and buggy."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "There were things that I knew that if you had a wall that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it and you could see some things freak out or vanish or not work."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "And I hated that, but I was up against the wall."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "We had to ship the game."}, {"time": 8223, "text": "It was still a lot of fun to play."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "It was novel, nobody had seen it."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "It gave you that startle reflex reaction."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "So it was worth shipping, but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky and janky and not what I was really proud of."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "So one of the things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein was I went, Catacombs used almost a conventional thing where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons basically that were clipped and back faced and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine from the professionals, but I wasn't getting it done right."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "I was not doing a good enough job."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "I didn't really have line of sight to fix it right."}, {"time": 8265, "text": "There's stuff that of course I look back, it's like, oh, it's obvious how to do this and do the math right, do your clipping right, check all of this, how you handle the precision."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "But I did not know how to do that at that time."}, {"time": 8275, "text": "Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?"}, {"time": 8279, "text": "Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that, but that had the flat shaded walls."}, {"time": 8282, "text": "So the texture mapping on the walls was what was bringing in some of these challenges that was hard for me and I couldn't solve it right at the time."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?"}, {"time": 8293, "text": "So the walls were solid color, one of 16 colors in Hover Tank."}, {"time": 8299, "text": "So that's easy, it's fast, you just draw the solid color for everything."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "Texture mapping is what we all see today where you have an image that is stretched and distorted onto the walls or the surfaces that you're working with."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "And it was a long time for me to just figure out how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs and I had these flaws."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "So that was important enough to me that rather than continuing to bang my head on that when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it, I went with a completely different approach for drawing for figuring out where the walls were which was a ray casting approach, which I had done in Catacombs 3D I had a bunch of C code trying to make this work right and it wasn't working right."}, {"time": 8345, "text": "In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount of assembly code."}, {"time": 8351, "text": "So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it but by making it a smaller amount of work that I could more tightly optimize it worked out and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid."}, {"time": 8362, "text": "It was nothing glitched in there."}, {"time": 8365, "text": "The game just was pretty much flawless through all of that and I was super proud of that."}, {"time": 8371, "text": "But eventually like in the later games I went back to the more span based things where I could get more total efficiency once I really did figure out how to do it."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "So there were two sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach which you still to this day you see people go and say let's write a ray casting engine because it's an understandable way of doing things that lets you make games very much like that."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "So you see ray casters in JavaScript, ray casters in Python, people that are basically going and re implementing that approach to taking a tiled world and casting out into it."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "It works pretty well but it's not the fastest way of doing it."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "Can you describe what ray casting is?"}, {"time": 8411, "text": "So you start off and you've got your screen which is 320 pixels across at the time if you haven't sized down the window for greater speed and at every pixel there's gonna be an angle from you've got your position in the world and you're going to just run along that angle and keep going until you hit a block."}, {"time": 8429, "text": "So up to 320 times across there it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "The performance challenge of that is as it's going out every block it's crossing it checks is this a solid wall."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway it's super efficient for that because you're only stepping across three or four blocks but then if somebody makes a room that covers our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "If you made one room that was nothing but walls at the far space it would go pretty slow because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests or something along the way."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "By the way the physics of our universe seems to be competing in this very thing."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "Yeah you get like I follow a little bit of something like Steven Wolfram's work on interconnected network information states of that and that's it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion on but it's interesting that people are considering things like that and have things that can back it up."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Yeah there's whole different sets of interesting stuff there."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect was what I called compiled scalers where the idea of you'd saw this in the earlier classic arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff where you would take a picture which is normally drawn directly on the screen and then if you have the ability to make it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels or fizzly small drop sampled pixels."}, {"time": 8532, "text": "That's the fundamental aspect of what our characters were doing in these 3D games."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "You would have it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character but now we can make them really big and make them really small and move it around."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "To make them turn there were literally eight different views of them."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "You just had these cardboard cutouts."}, {"time": 8553, "text": "But that was good enough for that startle fight reaction and it was kind of what we had to deal with there."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "So a straightforward approach to do that you could just write out your doubly nested loop of you've got your stretch factor and it's like you've got a point, you stretch by a little bit, it might be on the same pixel, it might be on the next pixel, it might have skipped a pixel."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "You can write that out but it's not gonna be fast enough where especially you get a character for that right in your face monster covering almost the entire screen."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine would have just been much too slow."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "It would have worked when they're small characters but then it would get slower and slower as they got closer to you until right at the time when you most care about having a fast reaction time, the game would be chunking down."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time was to, instead of saying I've got a general purpose version that can handle any scale, I used a program to make essentially a hundred or more separate little programs that was optimized for I will take an image and I will draw it 12 pixels tall."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall up by every two pixels even for that."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "So you would have the most optimized code so that in the normal case where most of the world is fairly large, like the pixels are big, we did not have a lot of memory."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "So in most cases that meant that you would load a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "So that was faster than even copying an image in a normal conventional case because most of the time the image is expanded."}, {"time": 8653, "text": "So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy, you might be doing one read and three or four writes as it got really big."}, {"time": 8660, "text": "And that had the beneficial aspect of just when you needed the performance most when things are covering the screen, it was giving you the most acceleration for that."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "By the way, were you able to understand this through thinking about it or were you testing like the right speed and like that?"}, {"time": 8676, "text": "This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents for things like this."}, {"time": 8681, "text": "So back in the Apple II days, the graphics were essentially single bits at a time."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "And if you wanted to make your little spaceship, if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world, if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next location, you would move by seven pixels at a time, so it'd go chunk, chunk, chunk."}, {"time": 8701, "text": "If you wanted to make it move smoothly, you actually had to make seven versions of the ship that were pre shifted."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "You could write a program that would shift it dynamically, but on a one megahertz processor, that's not going anywhere fast."}, {"time": 8713, "text": "So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game, you made separate versions of each of these sprites."}, {"time": 8720, "text": "Now there were a few more tricks you could pull that if it still wasn't fast enough, you could make a compiled shape where instead of this program that normally copies an image and says like, get this byte from here, stored here, get this byte, store this byte."}, {"time": 8735, "text": "If you've got the memory space, you could say, I'm going to write the program that does nothing but draw this shape."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "It's going to be like, I'm going to load the immediate value 25, which is some bit pattern, and then I'm going to store that at this

values of all of the image right into the program."}, {"time": 8762, "text": "And this was always a horrible trade off there, which you didn't have much memory and you didn't have much speed."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast, you could turn it into a program."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "And that was, knowing about that technique is what made me think about some of these unwinding it for the PC where people that didn't come from that background were less likely to think about that."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "I mean, there's some deep parallels probably to human cognition as well."}, {"time": 8787, "text": "There's something about optimizing and compressing the processing of a new information that requires you to predict the possible ways in which the game or the world might unroll."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "And you have something like compiled scaler is always there."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "So you have like, like you have a prediction of how the world will unroll and you have some kind of optimized data structure for that prediction."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "And then you can modify if the world turns out to be different, you can modify a slight way."}, {"time": 8822, "text": "And as far as building out techniques, so much of the brain is about the associative context."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "You know, they're just, when you learn something, it's in the context of something else and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "And I do think there are some deep things around like sparse distributed memories and boosting."}, {"time": 8838, "text": "That's like, if you can just be slightly above the noise floor of having some hint of something, you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "So having a, being a programmer and having a toolbox of like all of these things that, things that I did in all of these previous lives of programming tasks that still matters to me about how I'm able to pull up some of these things."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple 2 then being relevant for the PC."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "And I have still cases when I would, when I would work on mobile development then be like, okay, I did something like this back in the doom days, but now it's a different environment, but I have still had that tie."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "I can bring it in and I can transform it into what the world needs right now."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "And I do think that's actually one of the very core things with human cognition and brain like, you know, brain like functioning is finding these ways about you've got, your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "You know, it's, it is just a set of all of this stuff that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it."}, {"time": 8896, "text": "And they can just be slightly above the noise floor with a random noise in your neurons and synapses that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up."}, {"time": 8903, "text": "So you're saying some of these very specific solutions for different games, you find that there's a kernel of a deep idea that's generalizable to other, to other things."}, {"time": 8914, "text": "Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be, but that idea of like, I called out that compiled shaders in the forward that I wrote for that, the game engine black book, as you know, this is, it's kind of an end point of unrolling code, but that's one of those things that thinking about that and having that in your mind."}, {"time": 8931, "text": "And I'm sure there are some programmers that, you know, hear about that."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "Think about it a little bit."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "It's kind of the mind blown moment."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "It's like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code."}, {"time": 8940, "text": "And nowadays, you know, you have instruction cache issues and that's not necessarily the best idea, but there are different, it's an idea that has power and has

8965, "text": "What are some memorable technical challenges or innovations within that game?"}, {"time": 8969, "text": "So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out and we were on this crazy arc where Keen one through three, more success than we thought, Keen four through six, even more success, Wolfenstein even more success."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So we were on this crazy trajectory for things."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "So actually our first box commercial project was the Commander Keen game, but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version, 60 new levels."}, {"time": 8997, "text": "So the rest of the team took the game engine pretty much as it was and started working on that."}, {"time": 9002, "text": "We got new monsters, but it's basically reskins of the things there."}, {"time": 9007, "text": "And there's a really interesting aspect about that that I didn't appreciate until much, much later about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit about what you want to play, all the levels and a couple of our license things."}, {"time": 9021, "text": "There was a hard creative wall that you did not really benefit much by continuing to beat on it."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "But a game like Doom and other more modern games like Minecraft or something, there's kind of a Turing completeness level of design freedom that you get in games that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "All the creative people in the world could not go and do a masterpiece just with the technology that Wolfenstein had."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein, but you really couldn't do something crazy and different."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "But it didn't take that much more capability to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines and a little bit more artistic freedom to get to the point where people still announce new Doom levels today, all these years after without having completely tapped out the creativity."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "How did you put it?"}, {"time": 9067, "text": "Turing complete?"}, {"time": 9068, "text": "Yeah, Turing complete design space."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Design space."}, {"time": 9071, "text": "Where it's like, you know, we have the kind of computational universality on a lot of things and how different subsurface work."}, {"time": 9076, "text": "For creativity."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "But yeah, there's things where a box can be too small, but above a certain point, you kind of are at the point where you really have almost unbounded creative ability there."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "And Doom was the first time you crossed that line."}, {"time": 9091, "text": "Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created, and some of them still have something new and interesting to say to the world about it."}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?"}, {"time": 9103, "text": "Is it in the design space?"}, {"time": 9104, "text": "Is it something about the programming capabilities that you were able to add to the game?"}, {"time": 9110, "text": "So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part because the block limitations in Wolfenstein, what we had right there was not enough."}, {"time": 9120, "text": "The full scale blocks, although Minecraft really did show that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D and at one quarter of the scale of that, or one eighth in volume, is then sufficient to have all of that."}, {"time": 9133, "text": "But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein was too much of a creative limitation."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "We licensed the technology to a few other teams."}, {"time": 9141, "text": "None of them made too much of a dent with that."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "It just wasn't enough creative ability."}, {"time": 9147, "text": "But a little bit more, whether it was the variable floors and ceilings and

partitioning?"}, {"time": 9165, "text": "So the."}, {"time": 9165, "text": "Which is one of the technologies."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there."}, {"time": 9171, "text": "So while the team was working on Spirit Destiny for Wolfenstein, we had met another development team, Raven Software, while we were in Wisconsin."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "And they were doing, they had RPG background and I still kind of loved that."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "And I offered to do a game engine for them to let them do a 3D rendered RPG instead of the, like most RPG games were kind of hand drawn."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "They made it look kind of 3D, but it was done just all with artist work rather than a real engine."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world, but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting and the ability to have some sloped floors in different areas."}, {"time": 9208, "text": "And that was my intermediate step for a game called Shadowcaster."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "And it had slowed down enough."}, {"time": 9214, "text": "It was not fast enough to do our type of action things."}, {"time": 9217, "text": "So they had the screen crop down a little bit."}, {"time": 9219, "text": "So you couldn't go the full screen width like we would try to do in Wolfenstein, but I learned a lot."}, {"time": 9226, "text": "I got the floors and ceilings and lightings and it looked great."}, {"time": 9228, "text": "They were great artists up there."}, {"time": 9230, "text": "And it was an inspiration for us to look at some of that stuff."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "But I had learned enough from that, that I had the plan for, I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "And I wanted to do this free form geometry."}, {"time": 9243, "text": "I wanted to break out of this tile based 90 degree world limitations."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "So we had, that was when we got our next stations and we were working with these higher powered systems."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And we built an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary line segments."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "And I was working hard to try to make something that could render this fast enough."}, {"time": 9266, "text": "I was pushing myself pretty hard."}, {"time": 9268, "text": "And we were at a point where we could see some things that looked amazingly cool, but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it."}, {"time": 9277, "text": "For this flexibility, it was no longer, I couldn't just ray cast into it."}, {"time": 9281, "text": "And I had these very complex sets of lines and simple little worlds were okay."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "But the cool things that we wanted to do just weren't quite fast enough."}, {"time": 9289, "text": "And I wound up taking a break at that point."}, {"time": 9292, "text": "And I did the port."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "I did two ports of our games, Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo."}, {"time": 9301, "text": "It was a crazy difficult thing to do, which was an even slower processors, like a couple of megahertz processor."}, {"time": 9310, "text": "And it had been this whole thing where we had farmed out the work and it wasn't going well."}, {"time": 9317, "text": "And I took it back over and trying to make it go fast on there where it really did not have much processing power."}, {"time": 9325, "text": "The pixels were stretched up hugely and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "But in the end, it did come out fast enough to play and still be kind of fun from that."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "But that was where I started using BSP trees or binary space partitioning trees."}, {"time": 9338, "text": "It was one of those things I had to make it faster there."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein where it was all still 90 degree angles."}, {"time": 9349, "text": "BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that."}, {"time": 9353, "text": "And it was a big success."}, {"time": 9356, "text": "Then when I came back to working on Doom, I had this new tool in my toolbox."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "It was gonna be a lot harder with the arbitrary angles of Doom."}, {"time": 9363, "text": "This was where I really started grappling with epsilon problems."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "And just up until that point, I hadn't really had to deal with the fact that I am so many numeric things."}, {"time": 9373, "text": "This almost felt like a betrayal to me where people had told me that I had mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal where I was, people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "I really, everything that I did was really done with a solid high school math understanding."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "Algebra two trigonometry and that was what got me all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that, of just understanding basics of matrices and knowing it well enough to do something with it."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "What's the epsilon problems you ran into?"}, {"time": 9402, "text": "So when you wind up taking like a sloped line and you say, I'm going to intersect it with another sloped line, then you wind up with something that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "With the Wolfenstein tile maps, all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines looking at it from above."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "And if you cut one of them, it's just obvious the other one gets cut exactly at that point."}, {"time": 9424, "text": "But when you have angled lines, you're doing a kind of a slope intercept problem and you wind up with rational numbers there where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer or even on any fixed point value that you've got."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "So everything winds up having to snap to some fixed point value."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "So the lines slightly change their angle."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "You wind up, if you cut something here, this one's going to bend a little this way and it's not going to be completely straight."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "And then you come down to all these questions of, well, this one is a point on an angled line."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "You can't answer that in finite precision unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And later on, I did waste far too much time chasing things like that."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?"}, {"time": 9466, "text": "And it always blows up eventually, exponentially as you do it."}, {"time": 9470, "text": "So these kinds of things are impossible with computers."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "So they're possible."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "Again, there are paths to doing it, but you can't fit them conveniently in any of the numbers."}, {"time": 9480, "text": "You need to start using big nums and different factor trackings of different things."}, {"time": 9484, "text": "So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD and you want to do something perfectly, you're screwed if you're working with floating point."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "So you had to deal with this for the first time."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And there were lots of challenges there about like, okay, they build this cool thing."}, {"time": 9500, "text": "And the way the BSP trees work is it basically takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls in this clever way that you can then take all of these fragments."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "And then you can for sure, from any given point, get an ordering of everything in the world."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "And you can say, this goes in front of this, goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing."}, {"time": 9520, "text": "And that's super valuable for graphics where kind of a classic graphics algorithm would be painter's algorithm."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "You paint the furthest thing first, and then the next thing, and then the next thing, and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you."}, {"time": 9532, "text": "That's slow because you don't want to have to have drawn everything like that, but you can also flip it around and draw the closest thing to you."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "And then if you're clever about it, you can figure out what you need to draw that's visible beyond that."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "And that's what BSP trees allow you to do."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things, but it gives you that ordering."}, {"time": 9552, "text": "It's a clever way of doing things."}, {"time": 9553, "text": "And I remember I had learned this from one of my graphics Bible at the time, a book called Foley and Van Damme."}, {"time": 9560, "text": "And again, it was a different world back there."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "There was a small integer number of books."}, {"time": 9564, "text": "And this book that was big fat college textbook that I had read through many times."}, {"time": 9572, "text": "I didn't understand everything in it."}, {"time": 9574, "text": "Some of it wasn't useful to me, but they had the little thing about finite orderings of you draw a little T shaped thing and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees."}, {"time": 9588, "text": "And I got a little bit more information about that."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake, I got to meet Bruce Naylor, who is one of the original researchers that developed those technologies for academic literature."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And that was kind of fun, but I was very much just finding a tool that can help me solve what I was doing."}, {"time": 9605, "text": "And I was using it in this very crude way in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "The Epsilon problems got much worse in Quake and three dimensionals when things angle in every way."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "But eventually I did sort out how to do it reliably on Doom."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "There were still a few edge cases in Doom that were not absolutely perfect where they even got terminologies in the communities."}, {"time": 9627, "text": "Like when you got to something where it was messed up, it was a hall of mirrors effect because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw something there."}, {"time": 9633, "text": "And you would just wind up with the leftover remnants as you flipped between the two pages."}, {"time": 9639, "text": "But BSP trees were important for it."}, {"time": 9641, "text": "But it's again worth noting that after we did Doom, our major competition came from Ken Silverman and his build engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D and some of the other games for 3D Realms."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "And he used a completely different technology, nothing to do with BSP trees."}, {"time": 9659, "text": "So there's not just a one true way of doing things."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "There were critical things about to make any of those games fast."}, {"time": 9667, "text": "You had to separate your drawing into, you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines, just kind of changing exactly what you would draw with them."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "That was critical for the technologies at that time."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "And like all the games that were kind of like that wound up doing something similar, but there were still a bunch of other decisions that could be made."}, {"time": 9686, "text": "And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "We brought in multiplayer significantly and it was our first game that was designed to be modified by the user community where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs and things that people could build with tools that we released to them."}, {"time": 9704, "text": "And they eventually rewrote to be better than what we released, but they could build things and you could add it to your game without destructively modifying it, which is what you had to do in all the early games."}, {"time": 9714, "text": "You literally hacked the data files or the executable before while Doom was set up in this flexible way so that you could just say, run the normal game with this added on on top and it would overlay just the things that you wanted to there."}, {"time": 9729, "text": "Would you say that Doom was kind of the first true 3D game that you created?"}, {"time": 9734, "text": "So no, it's still, Doom would usually be called a two and a half D game where it had three dimensional points on it."}, {"time": 9740, "text": "And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things that people love to argue about, about what was the first 3D game."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "I still, like every month probably I hear from somebody about, well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?"}, {"time": 9754, "text": "And I give the point where characters had three coordinates."}, {"time": 9758, "text": "So you had like an X, Y and Z, the cacodamon could be coming in very high and come down towards you."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "The walls had three coordinates on them."}, {"time": 9767, "text": "So on some sense it's a 3D game engine, but it was not a fully general 3D game engine."}, {"time": 9773, "text": "You could not build a pyramid in Doom because you couldn't make a sloped wall, which was slightly different where in that previous shadow caster game, I could have vertexes and have a sloped floor there, but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability, but you literally couldn't make that."}, {"time": 9793, "text": "You could not, you could make different heights of passages, but you could not make a bridge over another area."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "You could not go over and above it."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "So it still had some 2D limitations to it."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "That's more about the building versus the actual experience."}, {"time": 9807, "text": "Cause the experience is."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "It felt like things would come at you, but again, you couldn't look up either."}, {"time": 9812, "text": "I am, you know, you could only pitch."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "It was four degrees of freedom rather than six degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way or pitch up and down."}, {"time": 9822, "text": "So that takes us to Quake."}, {"time": 9824, "text": "What was the leap there?"}, {"time": 9827, "text": "What was some fascinating technical challenges and there were a lot or not challenges, but innovations that you've come up with."}, {"time": 9834, "text": "So Quake was kind of the first thing where I did have to kind of come face to face with my limitations, where it was the first thing where I really did kind of give it my all and still come up, you know, come up a little bit short in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "And the company ran, they had some serious stresses through the whole project and we bit off a lot."}, {"time": 9859, "text": "So the things that we set out to do was it was going to be really a true 3D engine where it could do six degree of freedom."}, {"time": 9866, "text": "You could have all the viewpoints."}, {"time": 9869, "text": "You could model anything."}, {"time": 9871, "text": "It had a really remarkable new lighting model with the surface caching and things."}, {"time": 9877, "text": "That was one of those where it was starting to do some things that they weren't doing even on the very high end systems."}, {"time": 9883, "text": "And it was going to be completely programmable in the modding standpoint, where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom, you could replace almost all of the media, but you couldn't really change the game."}, {"time": 9895, "text": "There were still some people that were doing the hex setting of the executable, the dehacked things where you could change a few things about rules and people made some early capture the flag type things by hacking the executable, but it wasn't really set out to do that."}, {"time": 9908, "text": "Quake was going to have its own programming language that the game was going to be implemented in it."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "And that would be able to be overwritten just like any of the media."}, {"time": 9916, "text": "Code was going to be data for that."}, {"time": 9918, "text": "And you would be able to have expansion packs that changed fundamental things and mods and so on."}, {"time": 9924, "text": "And the multiplayer was going to be playable over the internet."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "It was going to support a client server rather than peer to peer."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "So we had the possibility of supporting larger numbers of players in disparate locations with this full flexibility of the programming overrides with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "And with this fancy new light mapped kind of surface caching side."}, {"time": 9949, "text": "It was a lot."}, {"time": 9950, "text": "And this was one of those things that if I could go back and tell younger me to do something differently, it would have been to split those innovations up into two phases in two separate games."}, {"time": 9962, "text": "It will be phase one and phase two."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "So it probably would have been taking the Doom rendering engine and bringing in the TCP IP client server."}, {"time": 9970, "text": "Focusing on the multiplayer."}, {"time": 9972, "text": "And the Quake C or would have been Doom C programming language there."}, {"time": 9976, "text": "So I would have split that into programming language and networking with the same Doom engine rather than forcing everybody to go towards the Quake engine, which really meant getting a Pentium."}, {"time": 9987, "text":

speaking of people happier, our mutual friend, Joe Rogan, it seems like the most important moment of his life is centered around Quake."}, {"time": 10009, "text": "So it was a definitive part of his

have been huge."}, {"time": 10108, "text": "We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster."}, {"time": 10111, "text": "And it would have given six degree of freedom and Pentium class systems a little bit more time to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people with the hardware requirements for Quake."}, {"time": 10122, "text": "Was there any dark moments for you personally,

characterized my childhood were I had books, comic books, Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "Like some of my fondest childhood memories are the convenience

was very much my happy place."}, {"time": 10338, "text": "If I could, I get my comic books and if I could go to a library and go through those little zero, zero, zero section where computer books were

technical challenges."}, {"time": 10377, "text": "What everything together from the networking to the graphics, what are some things you remember that were innovations you had to come up with in order to make it all happen?"}, {"time": 10392, "text": "Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake where on the one hand, the idea that I built my own programming language to implement the game in."}, {"time": 10400, "text": "Looking back, and I try to tell people, it's like every high level programmer sometime in their career goes through and they invent their own language."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done."}, {"time": 10410, "text": "People will be like, I'm gonna go write a computer programming language."}, {"time": 10413, "text": "And I don't regret having done it, but after that, I switched from Quake C, my quirky little pseudo object oriented or entity oriented language there."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "Quake two went back to using DLLs with C and then Quake three, I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler, which was a much smarter thing to do that I should have done originally for Quake."}, {"time": 10435, "text": "But building my own language was an experience."}, {"time": 10437, "text": "I learned a lot from that."}, {"time": 10439, "text": "And then there was a generation of game programmers that learned programming with Quake C, which I feel kind of bad about, because we give JavaScript a lot of crap, but Quake C was nothing to write home about there."}, {"time": 10453, "text": "But it allowed people to do magical things."}, {"time": 10455, "text": "You get into programming, not because you love the BNF syntax of a language, it's because the language lets you do something that you cared about."}, {"time": 10464, "text": "And here's very much, you could do something in a whole beautiful three dimensional world."}, {"time": 10469, "text": "And the idea and the fact that the code for the game was out there, you could say, I liked the shotgun, but I want it to be more bad ass."}, {"time": 10476, "text": "You go in there and say, okay, now it does 200 points damage."}, {"time": 10479, "text": "And then you go around with a big grin on your face, blowing up monsters all over the game."}, {"time": 10483, "text": "So yeah, it is not what I would do today going back with that language, but that was a big part of it."}, {"time": 10491, "text": "Learning about the networking stuff, because it's interesting where I learned these things by reading books."}, {"time": 10497, "text": "So I would get a book on networking and find something, I read all about it and learn, okay, packets, they can be out of order or lost or duplicated."}, {"time": 10506, "text": "These are all the things that can theoretically happen to packets."}, {"time": 10509, "text": "So I wind up spending all this time thinking about how do we deal about all of that?"}, {"time": 10513, "text": "And it turns out, of course, in the real world, those are things that yes, theoretically can happen with multiple routes, but they really aren't things that your 99.999% of your packets have to deal with."}, {"time": 10525, "text": "So there was learning experiences about lots of that."}, {"time": 10528, "text": "Like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP and how if you do things in UDP, you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases."}, {"time": 10537, "text": "So there's good arguments for using both for different game technology, different parts of the game process, transitioning from level to level and all."}, {"time": 10546, "text": "But the graphics were the showcase of what Quake was all about."}, {"time": 10551, "text": "It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there."}, {"time": 10555, "text": "And it was a while before there were competitive things out there."}, {"time": 10559, "text": "And it went a long time internally really not working where we were even building levels where the game just was not at all shippable with large fractions of the world, like disappearing, not being there, or being really slow in various parts of it."}, {"time": 10576, "text": "And it was this act of faith."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this."}, {"time": 10580, "text": "I think I'm gonna be able to make this work."}, {"time": 10583, "text": "And lots of stuff changed where the level designers would build something and then have to throw it away as something fundamental and the kind of graphics or level technology changed."}, {"time": 10593, "text": "And so there were two big things that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe."}, {"time": 10601, "text": "Two new things."}, {"time": 10602, "text": "There was certainly hardcore optimized low level assembly language."}, {"time": 10606, "text": "And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash away from Microsoft."}, {"time": 10610, "text": "And he had been one of my early inspirations where back in the soft disk days, the library of magazines that they had, some of my most treasured ones were Michael Abrash's articles in Dr. Dobbs journal."}, {"time": 10622, "text": "And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom, we were able to kind of hit him up and say, hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software."}, {"time": 10630, "text": "And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft."}, {"time": 10633, "text": "And he was on track for, and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off."}, {"time": 10638, "text": "And I did eventually convince him that what we were doing was gonna be really amazing with Quake."}, {"time": 10644, "text": "It was gonna be something nobody had seen before."}, {"time": 10648, "text": "It had these aspects of what we were talking about."}, {"time": 10651, "text": "We had metaverse talk back then."}, {"time": 10653, "text": "We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this."}, {"time": 10656, "text": "And Michael was big into the science fiction and we would talk about all that and kind of spin this tale."}, {"time": 10662, "text": "And it was some of the same conversations that we have today about the metaverse, about how you could have different areas linked together by portals and you could have user generated content and changing out all of these things."}, {"time": 10674, "text": "So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake."}, {"time": 10676, "text": "And we talked about things like, Duke used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience."}, {"time": 10682, "text": "That was the first wave of virtual reality was in the late 80s and early 90s, you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie and you had time in Newsweek talking about the early VPL headsets."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "And of course that cratered so hard that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality for decades afterwards, where it was just, it was smoke and mirrors."}, {"time": 10703, "text": "It was not real in the sense that you could actually do something real and valuable with it."}, {"time": 10708, "text": "But still we had that kind of common set of talking points."}, {"time": 10712, "text": "And we were talking about what these games could become and how you'd like to see people building all of these creative things."}, {"time": 10719, "text": "Because we were seeing an explosion of work with Doom at that time, where people were doing amazingly cool things."}, {"time": 10725, "text": "Like we saw cooler levels that we had built coming out of the user community."}, {"time": 10729, "text": "And then people finding ways to change the characters in different ways."}, {"time": 10734, "text": "And it was great."}, {"time": 10734, "text": "And we knew what we were doing in Quake was removing those last things."}, {"time": 10738, "text": "There was some quirky things with a couple of the data types that didn't work right for overriding."}, {"time": 10743, "text": "And then the core thing about the programming model."}, {"time": 10747, "text": "And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake."}, {"time": 10750, "text": "But the graphics side of it was still, I knew what I wanted to do."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "And it was one of these hubris things where it's like, well, so far I've been able to kind of kick everything that I set out to go do."}, {"time": 10766, "text": "But Quake was definitely a little bit more than could be comfortably chewed at that point."}, {"time": 10772, "text": "And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers and graphics programmers that I knew."}, {"time": 10779, "text": "And he was one of the people that I trusted to write assembly code better than I could."}, {"time": 10784, "text": "And there's a few people that I can point to about things like this where I'm a world class optimizer."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "I mean, I make things go fast, but I recognize there's a number of people that can write tighter assembly code, tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code than I can write."}, {"time": 10802, "text": "My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "I mean, I'm good at all of that, but the most leverage comes from making the decisions that are a little bit higher up where you figure out how to change your large scale problems so that these lower level problems are easier to do or it makes it possible to do them in a uniquely fast way."}, {"time": 10823, "text": "So most of my big wins in a lot of ways from all the way from the early games through VR and the aerospace work that I'm doing or did, and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on now is finding an angle on something that means you trade off something that you maybe think you need, but it turns out you don't need."}, {"time": 10843, "text": "And by making a sacrifice in one place, you can get big advantages in another place."}, {"time": 10848, "text": "Is it clear at which level of the system those big advantages can be gained?"}, {"time": 10854, "text": "It's not always clear."}, {"time": 10855, "text": "And that's why the thing that I try to make one of my core values, and I proselytize to a lot of people is trying to know the entire stack, trying to see through everything that happens."}, {"time": 10868, "text": "And it's almost impossible on like the web browser level of things where there's so many levels to it, but you should at least understand what they all are, even if you can't understand all the performance characteristics at each level, but it goes all the way down to literally the hardware."}, {"time": 10882, "text": "So what is this chip capable of?"}, {"time": 10886, "text": "And what is this software that you're writing capable of?"}, {"time": 10889, "text": "And then with this architecture you put on top of that, then the ecosystem around it, all the people that are working on it."}, {"time": 10895, "text": "So there are all these decisions and they're never made in a globally optimal way, but sometimes you can drive a thread of global optimality through it."}, {"time": 10905, "text": "You can't look at everything, it's too complicated, but sometimes you can step back up and make a different decision."}, {"time": 10911, "text": "And we kind of went through this on the graphic side on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad where Michael would spend his time writing, like I'd rough out the basic routines, like, okay, here's our span rasterizer."}, {"time": 10923, "text": "And he would spend a month writing this beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language that does what I asked it to do."}, {"time": 10933, "text": "And he did it faster than like my original code would do, or probably what I would be able to do even if I had spent that month on it."}, {"time": 10940, "text": "But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like, okay, well, I figured out at this higher level instead of drawing these in a painter's order here, I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40% of all of these pixels, but it means you need to rewrite kind of this interface of all of that."}, {"time": 10957, "text": "And I could tell that wore on him a little bit, but in the end it was the right thing to do where we wound up changing that rasterization approach and we wound up with a super optimized assembly language core loop and then a good system around it which minimized how much that had to be called."}, {"time": 10974, "text": "And so in order to be able to do this kind of system level thinking, whether we're talking about game development, aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR, you have to be able to understand the hardware, the low level software, the high level software, the design decisions, the whole thing, the full stack of it."}, {"time": 10998, "text": "Yeah, and that's where a lot of these things become possible."}, {"time": 11001, "text": "When you're really, when you're bringing the future forward, I mean, there's a pace that everything just kind of glides towards where we have a lot of progress that's happening at such a different, so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress just left to your own, programs just get faster."}, {"time": 11014, "text": "For a while it wasn't clear if they were gonna get fatter more than they get, quicker than they get faster and it cancels out, but it is clear now in retrospect, no, programs just get faster and have gotten faster for a long time."}, {"time": 11026, "text": "But if you wanna do something like back at that original talking about scrolling games, say what, this needs to be five times faster."}, {"time": 11034, "text": "Well, we can wait six years and just it'll naturally get that much faster at that time or you come up with some really clever way of doing it."}, {"time": 11043, "text": "So there are those opportunities like that in a whole bunch of different areas."}, {"time": 11048, "text": "Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that."}, {"time": 11051, "text": "There's not that many, there's a lot of opportunities for this, but it's not everyone's work a day type stuff."}, {"time": 11057, "text": "So everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work."}, {"time": 11060, "text": "They don't have to know how their compiler works, how the processor chip manages cache eviction and all these low level things."}, {"time": 11068, "text": "But sometimes there are powerful opportunities that you can look at and say, we can bring the future five years faster."}, {"time": 11077, "text": "We can do something that, wouldn't it be great if we could do this?"}, {"time": 11080, "text": "Well, we can do it today if we make a certain set of decisions."}, {"time": 11084, "text": "And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors where you say it's like, Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors where people thought it was more capable than it actually was, but we picked the right smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game where by doing this, people will think that it's more general."}, {"time": 11101, "text": "We are gonna amaze them with what they've got here and they won't notice that it doesn't do these other things."}, {"time": 11107, "text": "So smart decision making at that point, that's where that kind of global holistic top down view can work."}, {"time": 11116, "text": "And I'm really a strong believer that technology should be sitting at that table having those discussions because you do have cases where you say, well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever, where it's a pure design solution."}, {"time": 11132, "text": "And that's in some cases now where you truly have almost infinite resources."}, {"time": 11137, "text": "Like if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now, you don't even have to talk to a technology person."}, {"time": 11143, "text": "You can just have, any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there and it can be completely design based."}, {"time": 11150, "text": "But if you're trying to do something that's hard, either that can't be done for resources like VR on a mobile chip set, or that we don't even know how to do yet, like artificial general intelligence, it's probably going to be a matter of coming at it from an angle."}, {"time": 11165, "text": "Like, I mean, for AGI, we have some of like what are some of the hudder principles about how you can AXI or some of the, there are theoretical ways that you can say, this is the optimal learning algorithm that can solve everything, but it's completely impractical."}, {"time": 11178, "text": "You just can't do that."}, {"time": 11180, "text": "So clearly you have to make some concessions for general intelligence and nobody knows what the right ones are yet."}, {"time": 11187, "text": "So people are taking different angles of attack."}, {"time": 11189, "text": "I hope I've got something clever to come up with in that space."}, {"time": 11194, "text": "It's been surprising to me."}, {"time": 11195, "text": "And I think perhaps it is a principle of progress that smoke and mirrors somehow is the way you build the future."}, {"time": 11202, "text": "You kind of fake it till you make it and you almost always make it."}, {"time": 11207, "text": "And I think that's going to be the way we achieve AGI."}, {"time": 11210, "text": "That's going to be the way we build consciousness into our machines."}, {"time": 11215, "text": "There's philosophers debate about the Turing test is essentially about faking it till you make it."}, {"time": 11222, "text": "You start by faking it."}, {"time": 11224, "text": "And I think that always leads to making it because if we look at history."}, {"time": 11230, "text": "Arguments when, as soon as people start talking about qualia and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things, it's like, I just check out."}, {"time": 11237, "text": "I just don't think there's any value in those conversations."}, {"time": 11240, "text": "It's just like, go ahead, tell me it's not going to work."}, {"time": 11242, "text": "I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways."}, {"time": 11245, "text": "I don't know if you work with legged robots."}, {"time": 11246, "text": "There's a bunch of these."}, {"time": 11249, "text": "They

much love, but there's some animosity between you and John Romero."}, {"time": 11296, "text": "What is at the core of that animosity and human tension?"}, {"time": 11299, "text": "So there really hasn't been for a long time."}, {"time": 11304, "text": "And even at the beginning, it's like, yes, I did push Romero out of the company."}, {"time": 11309, "text": "And this is one of the things that I look back, if I could go back telling my younger self some advice about things, the original founding kind of corporate structure of id Software really led to a bunch of problems."}, {"time": 11325,

that."}, {"time": 11356, "text": "I was 20 something years old and it did bother me when I'm like, everybody, okay, we need to all pull together and we've done it before everybody."}, {"time": 11365, "text": "We know we can do this if we get together and we grind it all out, but not everybody wanted to do that for all time."}, {"time": 11373, "text": "And I was the youngest one of the crowd there."}, {"time": 11375, "text": "I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations and left at that point where it was, all right, either everybody has to be contributing like up to this level or they need to get pushed out was not, that was not a great situation."}, {"time": 11394, "text": "And I look back on it and know that we pushed people out of the company that could have contributed if there was a different framework for them."}, {"time": 11402, "text": "And the modern kind of Silicon Valley, like let your stock vest over a time period and maybe it's non voting stock and all those different things."}, {"time": 11409, "text": "We knew nothing about any of that."}, {"time": 11411, "text": "I mean, we didn't know what we were doing in terms of corporate structure or anything."}, {"time": 11416, "text": "So if you think the framework was different, some of the human tension could have been a little bit."}, {"time": 11420, "text": "It almost certainly would have."}, {"time": 11422, "text": "I mean, I look back at that and it's like even trying to summon up in my mind, it's like, I know I was really, really angry about, like Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work or not carrying his load on the design for Quake and coming up with things there."}, {"time": 11440, "text": "But he was definitely doing things."}, {"time": 11443, "text": "He made some of the best levels there."}, {"time": 11444, "text": "He was working with some of our external teams like Raven on the licensing side of things, but there were differences of opinion about it, but he landed right on his feet."}, {"time": 11457, "text": "He went and he got $20 million from Eidos to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way and spun up three teams simultaneously because that was always one of the challenging things in it where we were doing these single string, one project after another."}, {"time": 11473, "text": "And I think some of them wanted to grow the company more and I didn't because I knew people that were saying that, oh, companies turn to shit when you got 50 employees."}, {"time": 11482, "text": "It's just a different world there."}, {"time": 11484, "text": "And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects, but you can look at it and say, well, business realities matter."}, {"time": 11491, "text": "It's like, you're super successful here and we could take a swing and a miss on something, but you do it a couple of times and you're out of luck."}, {"time": 11499, "text": "There's a reason companies try to have multiple teams running at one time."}, {"time": 11505, "text": "And so that was, again, something I didn't really appreciate back then."}, {"time": 11509, "text": "So if you look past all that, you did create some amazing things together."}, {"time": 11513, "text": "What did you love about John Romero?"}, {"time": 11515, "text": "What did you respect and appreciate about him?"}, {"time": 11517, "text":

"text": "He had made all of these games."}, {"time": 11527, "text": "He had worked at one of the companies that I thought was the coolest at Origin Systems."}, {"time": 11532, "text": "And he knew all this stuff."}, {"time": 11534, "text": "He made things happen fast."}, {"time": 11536, "text": "And he was also kind of a polymath about this where he could do, he drew his own art."}, {"time": 11541, "text": "He made his own levels, as well as we worked on sound design systems on top of actually being a really good programmer."}, {"time": 11549, "text": "And we went through a little, it was kind of fun where one of the early things that we did where there was kind of the young buck bit going in where I was the new guy."}, {"time": 11559, "text": "And he was the top man programmer at the soft disk area."}, {"time": 11564, "text": "And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend that we were gonna like race to implement this game, to port one of our PC games back down to the Apple II."}, {"time": 11572, "text": "And that was where we finally kind of became clear."}, {"time": 11575, "text": "It's like, okay, Carmack stands a little bit apart on the programming side of things."}, {"time": 11580, "text": "But Romero then very gracefully moved into, well, he'll work on the tools, he'll work on the systems, do some of the game design stuff, as well as contributing on, starting to lead the design aspects of a lot of things."}, {"time": 11592, "text": "So he was enormously valuable in the early stuff."}, {"time": 11596, "text": "And so much of Doom and even Quake have his stamp on it in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 11601, "text": "But he wasn't at the same level of focus that I brought to the work that we were doing there."}, {"time": 11609, "text": "And he really did, we hit such a degree of success that it was all in the press about that."}, {"time": 11615, "text": "The rockstar game programmers."}, {"time": 11618, "text": "I mean, it's the Beatles problem."}, {"time": 11620, "text": "Yeah, I mean, he ate it up and he did personify."}, {"time": 11623, "text": "There was the whole game developers with Ferraris that we had there."}, {"time": 11629, "text": "And I thought that led to some challenges there."}, {"time": 11633, "text": "But so much of the stuff that was great in the games did come from him."}, {"time": 11639, "text": "And I would certainly not take that away from him."}, {"time": 11641, "text": "And even after we parted ways and he took his swing with Eidos, in some ways, he was ahead of the curve with mobile gaming as well, where one of his companies after Eidos was working on feature phone game development."}, {"time": 11656, "text": "And I wound up doing some of that just before the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone phase there."}, {"time": 11663, "text": "And that was something that clearly did turn out to be a huge thing, although he was too early for what he was working on at that time."}, {"time": 11671, "text": "We've had pretty cordial relationships where I was happy to talk with him any time I'd run into him at a conference."}, {"time": 11678, "text": "I have actually had some other people just say, it's like, oh, you shouldn't go over there and give him the time of day."}, {"time": 11684, "text": "Or felt that Masters of Doom played things up in a way that I shouldn't be too happy with."}, {"time": 11692, "text": "But I'm OK with all of that."}, {"time": 11694, "text": "So you've still got love in your heart."}, {"time": 11696, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him like last year, or I guess it was even this year, about mentioning that I'm going off doing this AI stuff."}, {"time": 11703, "text": "I'm going big into artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 11706, "text": "And he had a bunch of ideas for how AI is going to play into gaming."}, {"time": 11710, "text": "And asked if I was interested in collaborating."}, {"time": 11713, "text": "And it's not in line with what I'm doing."}, {"time": 11716, "text": "But I do wish almost everyone the best."}, {"time": 11719, "text": "I mean, I know I may not have partnered on the best of terms with some people."}, {"time": 11724, "text": "But I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now."}, {"time": 11729, "text": "He wrote, I'm working on a game called Demio, which is really an awesome VR game."}, {"time": 11733, "text": "It's like Dungeons and Dragons."}, {"time": 11735, "text": "We all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together."}, {"time": 11736, "text": "That was one of the things."},

me smile seeing Tom involved with an RPG game in virtual reality."}, {"time": 11749, "text": "You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013, and maybe less than a year involved in a bit in 2019."}, {"time": 11760, "text": "Oculus was acquired by Facebook Now Meta in 2014."}, {"time": 11764, "text": "You've spoken brilliantly about both the low level details, the experimental design, and the big picture vision of virtual reality."}, {"time": 11772, "text": "Let me ask you about the metaverse, the big question here, both philosophically and technically."}, {"time": 11778, "text": "How hard is it to build the metaverse?"}, {"time": 11780, "text": "What is the metaverse in your view?"}, {"time": 11782, "text": "You started with discussing and thinking about Quake as a kind of a metaverse."}, {"time": 11787, "text": "As you think about it today, what is the metaverse, the thing that could create this compelling user value, this experience that will change the world, and how hard is it to build it?"}, {"time": 11799, "text": "So the term comes from Neal Stephenson's book Snow Crash, which many of us had read back in the 90s."}, {"time": 11804, "text": "It was one of those kind of formative books."}, {"time": 11807, "text": "And there was this sense that the possibilities and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities to build a virtual world that does whatever you want, whatever you ask of it, has been a powerful draw for generations of developers, game developers specifically, and people that are thinking about more general purpose applications."}, {"time": 11830, "text": "So we were talking about that back in the Doom and Quake days about how do you wind up with an interconnected set of worlds that you kind of visit from one to another."}, {"time": 11839, "text": "And as web pages were becoming a thing, you start thinking about what is the interactive kind of 3D based equivalent of this."}, {"time": 11847, "text": "And there were a lot of really bad takes."}, {"time": 11849, "text": "You had like Vermol and virtual reality markup languages."}, {"time": 11854, "text": "And there's aspects like that that came from people saying, well, what kind of capabilities should we develop to enable this?"}, {"time": 11863, "text": "And that kind of capability first work has usually not panned out very well."}, {"time": 11868, "text": "On the other hand, we have successful games that started with things like Doom and Quake and communities that formed around those, whether it was server lists in the early days or literal portaling between different games, and then modern things that are on completely different order of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite that have 100 million plus users."}, {"time": 11891, "text": "I still think that that's the right way to go to build the metaverse is you build something that's amazing that people love and people wind up spending all their time in because it's awesome."}, {"time": 11901, "text": "And you expand the capabilities of that."}, {"time": 11904, "text": "So even if it's a very basic experience, if it's awesome."}, {"time": 11908, "text": "Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things."}, {"time": 11911, "text": "That's basic as it gets."}, {"time": 11912, "text": "What's been able to be done with that is really enlightening."}, {"time": 11916, "text": "And there are other cases where, like right now, Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids."}, {"time": 11923, "text": "And that was a capability first play."}, {"time": 11925, "text": "And it's achieving scale that's on the same order of those things."}, {"time": 11929, "text": "So it's not impossible, but my preferred bet would be you make something amazing that people love and you make it better and better."}, {"time": 11936, "text": "And that's where I could say we could have gone back and followed a path like that in the early days if you just take the same game, whether it's when Activision demonstrated that you could make Call of Duty every year."}, {"time": 11949, "text": "And not only is it not bad, people love it."}, {"time": 11952, "text": "And it's very profitable."}, {"time": 11954, "text": "The idea that you could have taken something like that, take a great game, release a new version every year that lets the capabilities grow and expand to start saying it's like, OK, it's a game about running around and shooting things, but now you can bring your media into it."}, {"time": 11970, "text": "You can add persistence of social signs of life or whatever you want to add to it."}, {"time": 11977, "text": "I still think that's quite a good position to take."}, {"time": 11981, "text": "And I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms up capability approach with Horizon Worlds where it's a fairly general purpose, creators can build whatever they want in their sort of thing, it's hard to compare and compete with something like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity even though it was not designed originally as a general purpose sort of thing."}, {"time": 12005, "text": "So we have examples on both sides."}, {"time": 12008, "text": "Me personally, I would have bet on trying to do entertainment, valuable destination first, and expanding from there."}, {"time": 12016, "text": "So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of, if we look back a couple of centuries from now and you think about the experiences that marked the singularity, the transition where most of our world moved into virtual reality, what do you think those experiences will look like?"}, {"time": 12040, "text": "So I do think it's going to be kind of like the way the web slowly took over, where you're the frog in the pot of water that's slowly heating up, where having lived through all of that, I remember when it was shocking to start seeing the first website address on a billboard when you're like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world."}, {"time": 12060, "text": "This is spreading out in some way."}, {"time": 12063, "text": "But when you look back and say, well, what made the web take off?"}, {"time": 12068, "text": "And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there."}, {"time": 12072, "text": "It was a bunch of little things that turned out not to even be the things that are relevant now that brought them into it."}, {"time": 12078, "text": "So I wonder if, I mean, like you said, you're not a historian."}, {"time": 12083, "text": "So maybe there is a historian out there that could really identify that moment, data driven way."}, {"time": 12090, "text": "It could be like MySpace or something like that."}, {"time": 12093, "text": "Maybe the first major social network that really reached into non geek world or something like that."}, {"time": 12102, "text": "I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians, though, looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes where so many of these things are like we see an exponential curve."}, {"time": 12112, "text": "But it's not because like one thing is going exponential."}, {"time": 12115, "text": "It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves overlapped on top of each other."}, {"time": 12120, "text": "And they just happen to keep adding up so that you've got something kind of going exponential at any given point."}, {"time": 12126, "text": "But no single one of them was the critical thing."}, {"time": 12129, "text": "There were dozens and dozens of things."}, {"time": 12131, "text": "I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things, but even like blogging giving way to social media and getting resurrected in other guises."}, {"time": 12142, "text": "And the memes with the dancing baby GIF or whatever the all your base now belong to us."}, {"time": 12149, "text": "Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes and the different evolution of humor on the internet that I'm sure the historians will also write books about from the different website that support to create the infrastructure for that humor like Reddit and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 12166, "text": "So people will go back, and they will name firsts and critical moments."}, {"time": 12170, "text": "But it's probably going to be a poor approximation of what actually happens."}, {"time": 12174, "text": "And we've already seen in the VR space where it didn't play out the way we thought it would in terms of what was going to be like when the modern era of VR basically started with my E3 demo of Doom 3 on the Rift prototype."}, {"time": 12188, "text": "So we're like first person shooters in VR, match made in heaven, right?"}, {"time": 12192, "text": "And that didn't work out that way at all."}, {"time": 12195, "text": "They have the most comfort problems with it."}, {"time": 12198, "text": "And then the most popular virtual reality app is Beat Saber, which nobody predicted back then."},

"text": "It actually makes very clear sense when you analyze it from hindsight and look at the engineering reasons where it's not just that it was a magical quirky idea."}, {"time": 12225, "text": "It was something that played almost perfectly to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR where the one thing that I really underestimated importance in VR was the importance of the controllers."}, {"time": 12235, "text": "I was still thinking we could do a lot more with the game pad and just the amazingness of taking any existing game, being able to move your head around and look around, that that was really amazing."}, {"time": 12246, "text": "But the controllers were super important."}, {"time": 12249, "text": "But the problem is so many things that you do with the controllers just suck."}, {"time": 12253, "text": "It feels like it breaks the illusion like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers where you're like, oh, use the grip button when you're kind of close and it'll snap into your hand."}, {"time": 12261, "text": "All of those things are unnatural actions that you do them and it's still part of the VR experience."}, {"time": 12267, "text": "But Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths."}, {"time": 12272, "text": "It completely hides all the weaknesses of it because you are holding something in your hand."}, {"time": 12277, "text": "You keep a solid grip on it the whole time."}, {"time": 12279, "text": "It slices through things without ever bumping into things."}, {"time": 12282, "text": "You never get into the point where, I'm knocking on this table, but in VR, my hand just goes right through it."}, {"time": 12288, "text": "So you've got something that slices through."}, {"time": 12291, "text": "So it's never your brain telling you, oh, I should have hit something."}, {"time": 12294, "text": "You've got a lightsaber here."}, {"time": 12295, "text": "It's just, you expect it to slice through everything."}, {"time": 12298, "text": "Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect of virtual reality where you're blocking the world off and constructing the world around you."}, {"time": 12307, "text": "And being something that can run efficiently on even this relatively low powered hardware and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time where a lot of modern games, you're supposed to sit down and play it for an hour just to get anywhere."}, {"time": 12322, "text": "Sometimes a new game takes an hour to get through the tutorial level."}, {"time": 12325, "text": "And that's not good for VR for a couple reasons."}, {"time": 12327, "text": "You do still have the comfort issues if you're moving around at all, but you've also got just discomfort from the headset, battery lifespan on the mobile versions."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "So having things that do break down into three and four minute windows of play, that turns out to be very valuable from a gameplay standpoint."}, {"time": 12345,

excellent daily fitness thing to be doing."}, {"time": 12369, "text": "If you go play an hour of Beat Saber or Supernatural or something, that is legit solid exercise."}, {"time": 12376, "text": "And it's more fun than doing it just about any other way there."}, {"time": 12379, "text": "So that's kind of the arcade stage of things."}, {"time": 12383, "text": "If I were to say with my experience with VR, the thing that I think is powerful is the, maybe it's not here yet, but the degree to which it is immersive in the way that Quake is immersive."}, {"time": 12398, "text": "It takes you to another world."}, {"time": 12400, "text": "For me, because I'm a fan of role playing games, the Elder Scrolls series, like Skyrim or even Daggerfall, it just takes you to another world."}, {"time":

that was dystopian."}, {"time": 12441, "text": "And like, that's like, oh, you're just going to forget about the world outside."}, {"time": 12445, "text": "And I don't get that mindset where the idea that if you can make the world better inside the headset than outside, you've just improved the person's life that has a headset that can wear it."}, {"time": 12458, "text": "And there are plenty of

do a lot of things like that that can be very, very rich."}, {"time": 12479, "text": "So yeah, I want the, I think it's going to be a positive thing, this world where people want to go back into their headset, where it can be better than somebody that's living in a tiny apartment can have a palatial estate in virtual reality."}, {"time": 12491, "text": "They can have all their friends from all over

certain number."}, {"time": 12528, "text": "There's all these things that need to be fixed, but that's one of those things you can look at and say, we know there's value there."}, {"time": 12534, "text": "We just need to really grind hard, file off all the rough edges and make that possible."}, {"time": 12539, "text": "So you do think we have line of sight because there's a reason like, I do this podcast in person, for example."}, {"time": 12549, "text": "So doing it remotely, it's not the same."}, {"time": 12554, "text": "And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same, I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why."}, {"time": 12560, "text": "But you're saying that it's possible, whatever the magic is for in person interaction, that immersiveness of the experience, we are almost there."}, {"time": 12572, "text": "Yes, so the idea of like, I'm doing a VR interview with someone."}, {"time": 12577, "text": "I'm not saying it's here right now, but you can see glimmers of what it should be."}, {"time": 12582, "text": "And we largely know what would need to be fixed and improved to, like you say, there's a difference between at remote interview doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face to face."}, {"time": 12593, "text": "There's that sense of presence, that immediacy, the super low latency responsiveness, being able to see all the subtle things there, just occupying the same field of view."}, {"time": 12603, "text": "And all of those are things that we absolutely can do in VR."}, {"time": 12607, "text": "And that simple case of a small meeting with a couple of people, that's the much easier case than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse with a thousand people going across a huge bridge to amazing places, that's harder in a lot of other technical ways."}, {"time": 12622, "text": "Not to say we can't also do that, but that's further away and has more challenges."}, {"time": 12626, "text": "But this small thing about being able to have a meeting with one or a few people and have it feel real, feel like you're there, like you have the same interactions and talking with them, you get subtle cues as we start getting eye and face

important thing that people miss where there was a lot of people that, especially rich people that would look at VR and say, it's like, oh, this just isn't that good."}, {"time": 12659, "text": "And I'd say, it's like, well, you've already been courtside backstage and on pit row and you've done all of these experiences because you get to do them in real life."}, {"time": 12668, "text": "But most people don't get to."}, {"time": 12670, "text": "And even if the experience is only half as good, if it's something that they never would have gotten to do before, it's still a very good thing."}, {"time": 12677, "text": "And as we can just, we can push that number up over time."}, {"time": 12680, "text": "It has a minimum viable value level when it does something that is valuable enough to people, as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric than it is outside and people choose to go there, we're on the right path."}, {"time": 12693, "text": "And we have a value gradient that I'm just always hammering on."}, {"time": 12697, "text": "We can just follow this value gradient, just keep making things better rather than going for that one, close your eyes, swing for the fences, kind of silver bullet approach."}, {"time": 12708, "text": "Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient for in person meetings, because if you get that right, I mean, that would change the world."}, {"time": 12714, "text": "That it doesn't need to, I mean, you don't need a ready player one."}, {"time": 12719, "text": "But I wonder if there's that value gradient you can follow along, because if there is and you follow it, then there'll be a certain like phase shift at a certain point where people will shift from Zoom to this."}, {"time": 12738, "text": "I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?"}, {"time": 12743, "text": "Is it software, is it hardware?"}, {"time": 12745, "text": "Is it like, is it all about latency?"}, {"time": 12747, "text": "So I have big arguments internally about strategic things like that, where like the next headset that's coming out that we've made various announcements about is gonna be a higher end headset, more expensive, more features."}, {"time": 12761, "text": "Lots of people wanna make those trade offs."}, {"time": 12765, "text": "We'll see what the market has to say about the exact trade offs we've made here."}, {"time": 12769, "text": "But if you wanna replace Zoom, you need to have something that everybody has."}, {"time": 12775, "text": "So you like cheaper."}, {"time": 12776, "text": "I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper wind up being a virtuous cycle there where expensive and more features tends to also lead towards heavier."}, {"time": 12787, "text": "And it just kind of goes, it's like, let's add more features."}, {"time": 12789, "text": "The features are not, they have physical presence and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things."}, {"time": 12796, "text": "So I've always favored a lower end, cheaper, faster approach."}, {"time": 12801, "text": "That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR rather than the higher end PC headsets."}, {"time": 12806, "text": "And I think that's proven out well."}, {"time": 12809, "text": "But there's, ideally we have a whole range of things, but if you've only got one or two things, it's important that those two things cover the scope that you think is most important."}, {"time": 12820, "text": "When we're in a world when it's like cell phones and there's 50 of them on the market covering every conceivable ecological niche you want, that's gonna be great, but we're not gonna be there for a while."}, {"time": 12829, "text": "Where are the bottlenecks?"}, {"time": 12831, "text": "Is it the hardware or the software?"}, {"time": 12833, "text": "Yeah, so right now you can play, you can get work rooms on Quest and you can set up these things and it's a pretty good experience."}, {"time": 12841, "text": "It's surprisingly good."}, {"time": 12842, "text": "I haven't tried it."}, {"time": 12845, "text": "Yeah, the voice latency is better on that than a lot better than a Zoom meeting."}, {"time": 12850, "text": "So you've got a more, a better sense of immediacy there."}, {"time": 12853, "text": "The expressions that you get from the current hardware with just kind of your controllers and your head is pretty realistic feeling."}, {"time": 12861, "text": "You've got a pretty good sense of being there with someone with it."}, {"time": 12864, "text": "Are these like avatars of people?"}, {"time": 12868, "text": "Do you get to see their body?"}, {"time": 12870, "text": "And they're sitting around a table?"}, {"time": 12873, "text": "And it feels better than Zoom?"}, {"time": 12875, "text": "It feels better than you, yeah, better than you'd expect for that."}, {"time": 12877, "text": "It is definitely, yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better than Zoom when everything's working right, but there's still all the rough edges of, the reason Zoom became so successful is because they just nailed the usability of everything."}, {"time": 12891, "text": "It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience."}, {"time": 12894, "text": "And we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff."}, {"time": 12898, "text": "I'm trying to push hard to get, I keep talking about it's like, it needs to just be one click to make everything happen."}, {"time": 12925, "text": "User interface needs to get a lot better."}, {"time": 12928, "text": "Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better."}, {"time": 12930, "text": "We need to have a hundred million of them out there just so that everybody knows somebody that uses this all the time."}, {"time": 12937, "text": "Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle because I do think the interface is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution."}, {"time": 12948, "text": "It's so interesting how like you said one click, but it's also like how you achieve that one click."}, {"time": 12954, "text": "What is, can I ask a dark question?"}, {"time": 12958, "text": "Maybe let's keep it outside of meta, but this is about meta, but also Google and big company."}, {"time": 12965, "text": "Are they able to do this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 12967, "text": "It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat, is they seem to not do a good job of creating these user friendly interfaces as they get bigger and bigger as a company."}, {"time": 12982, "text": "Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces ever early on in its, I mean, creating Gmail, just so many brilliant interfaces and it just seems to be getting crappier and crappier at that."}, {"time": 12997, "text": "Same with meta, same with Microsoft."}, {"time": 13002, "text": "It's just, it seems to get worse and worse at that."}, {"time": 13005, "text": "I don't know what it is, because you've become more conservative, careful, risk averse."}, {"time": 13009, "text": "Is that why?"}, {"time": 13011, "text": "It's been really eye opening to me working inside a tech titan, where I had my small companies and then we're acquired by a midsize game publisher and then Oculus getting acquired by meta and meta has grown by a factor of many just in the eight years since the acquisition."}, {"time": 13032, "text": "So I did not have experience with this and it was interesting because I remember like previously my benchmark for kind of use of resources was some of the government programs I interacted with on the aerospace side."}, {"time": 13046, "text": "And I remember thinking there was, okay, there's an air force program and they spent $50 million and they didn't launch anything."}, {"time": 13054, "text": "They didn't even build anything."}, {"time": 13055, "text": "It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it."}, {"time": 13062, "text": "It's like $50 million and I've had to radically recalibrate my sense of like how much money can be spent with mediocre resources."}, {"time": 13074, "text": "Where on the plus side, VR has turned out, we've built pretty much exactly what, we just passed the 10 year mark then from like my first demo of the Rift."}, {"time": 13086, "text": "And if I could have said what I wanted to have, it would have been a standalone inside out tracked 4K resolution headset that I, that could still plug into a PC for high end rendering."}, {"time": 13098, "text": "And that's exactly what we've got on Quest 2 right now."}, {"time": 13100, "text": "Yes, first of all, let's pause on that with me being cranky and everything."}, {"time": 13104, "text": "It's what Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible."}, {"time": 13110, "text": "I mean, this is, when I thought about the future of VR, this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say."}, {"time": 13116, "text": "And maybe in terms of the experience as well, but it's still not there somehow."}, {"time": 13122, "text": "On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win."}, {"time": 13124, "text": "And we've got, we've sold, we're a success right now, but the amount of resources that have gone into it, it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year, like on Reality Labs."}, {"time": 13139, "text": "Now Reality Labs covers a lot."}, {"time": 13141, "text": "It was, VR was not the large part of it."}, {"time": 13144, "text": "It also had Portal and Spark and the big AR research efforts."}, {"time": 13148, "text": "And it's been expanding out to include AI and other things there where there's a lot going on there."}, {"time": 13155, "text": "But $10 billion was just a number that I had trouble processing."}, {"time": 13160, "text": "It's just, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about that much money being spent."}, {"time": 13164, "text": "But that's how they demonstrate commitment to this, where it's not more so than like, yeah, Google goes and cancels all of these projects, different things like that, while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR and AR is still further out with it."}, {"time": 13184, "text": "It's not just gonna vanish, the work's going in."}, {"time": 13186, "text": "I just wish it could be, all those resources could be applied more effectively because I see all these cases."}, {"time": 13193, "text": "I point out these examples of how a third party that we're kind of competing with in various ways."}, {"time": 13198, "text": "There's a number of these examples and they do work with a 10th of the people that we do internally and a lot of it comes from, yes, the small company can just go do it while in a big company, you do have to worry about, is there some SDK internally that you should be using because another team's making it, you have to have your cross functional group meetups for different things."}, {"time": 13222, "text": "You do have more concerns about privacy or diversity and equity and safety of different things, parental issues and things that a small startup company can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting."}, {"time": 13236, "text": "And there's a lot more that is a problem that you have to pay attention to in the big companies, but I'm not willing to believe that we are within even a factor of two or four of what the efficiency could be."}, {"time": 13248, "text": "I am constantly kind of crying out for it's like, we can do better than this."}, {"time": 13253, "text": "And you wonder what the mechanisms to unlock that efficiency are."}, {"time": 13257, "text": "I don't, there is some sense in a large company that like an individual engineer might not believe that they can change the world."}, {"time": 13267, "text": "Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility to be the one who changes the world in a big company, I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed by a single engineer anyway."}, {"time": 13281, "text": "So if whether inside Google or inside a startup, it doesn't matter, it's just like Google and Meta needs to help those engineers believe they're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency."}, {"time": 13292, "text": "It'll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack that's inside Meta right now to change everything."}, {"time": 13300, "text": "And I try to point that out and push people."}, {"time": 13303, "text": "It's like, try to go ahead."}, {"time": 13305, "text": "And when you see some, because there is, you get the silo mentality where you're like, okay, I know something's not right over there, but I'm staying in my lane here."}, {"time": 13313, "text": "And there's a couple of people that I can think about that are willing to just like hop all over the place and man, I treasure them."}, {"time": 13321, "text": "The people that are just willing to, they're fearless."}, {"time": 13323, "text": "They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel and change this distribution and go in and hack a firmware over here to get something done right."}, {"time": 13331, "text": "And that is relatively rare."}, {"time": 13334, "text": "There's thousands of developers and you've got a small handful that are willing to operate at that level."}, {"time": 13339, "text": "And it's potentially risky for them."}, {"time": 13342,

for it's like you said something insensitive in that post and you should probably not say that."}, {"time": 13358, "text": "But for the most part, yes, I get away with, every week I'm posting something pretty loud and opinionated internally."}, {"time": 13367, "text": "And I think that's useful for the company, but yeah, it's rare to have a position like that."}, {"time": 13374, "text": "And I can't necessarily offer advice for how someone can do that."}, {"time": 13379, "text": "Well, you could offer advice to a company in general to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild, like the wildest ideas come from the young minds."}, {"time": 13390, "text": "And so you need to give the young minds freedom to think big and wild and crazy."}, {"time": 13396, "text": "And for that, they have to be opinionated."}, {"time": 13398, "text": "They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts and pursue them with a full passion without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 13411, "text": "Obviously startups really empower that, but big companies could too."}, {"time": 13414, "text": "And that's a design challenge for big companies to see how can you enable that?"}, {"time": 13420, "text": "How can you empower that?"}, {"time": 13421, "text": "Yeah, because the big company, there are so many resources there."}, {"time": 13423, "text":

people inside of those large companies that are incredible."}, {"time": 13452, "text": "You have a friendship with Elon Musk."}, {"time": 13456, "text": "Often when I talk to him, he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer and just a big picture thinker you are."}, {"time": 13462, "text": "His huge amount of respect for you."}, {"time": 13466, "text": "I just, I've never been a fly in the wall between a discussion between the two of you."}, {"time": 13470, "text": "I just wonder, is there something you guys debate, argue about, discuss?"}, {"time": 13476, "text": "Is there some interesting problems that the two of you think about?"}, {"time": 13481, "text": "You come from different worlds."}, {"time": 13482, "text": "Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace."}, {"time": 13485,

debates the two of you have?"}, {"time": 13497, "text": "So I think in some ways, we do have a kind of similar background where we're almost exactly the same age."}, {"time": 13503, "text": "And we had kind of similar programming backgrounds on the personal computers and even some of the books that we would read and things that would kind of turn us into the people that we are today."}, {"time": 13514, "text": "And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities where we kind of call bullshit on the same things and kind of see the same opportunities in different technology."}, {"time": 13527, "text": "And there's that sense of, I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things."}, {"time": 13531, "text": "And he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing and engineering and operational standpoints for things."}, {"time": 13539, "text": "And so, I mean, I first met Elon right at the start of the aerospace era where I wasn't familiar with, I was still in my game dev bubble."}, {"time": 13547, "text": "I really wasn't familiar with all the startups that were going and being successful and what went on with PayPal and all of his different companies."},

funding in the larger scheme of things compared to like a NASA or something like that was really tiny."}, {"time": 13598, "text": "It was a lot more than I had at the time."}, {"time": 13600, "text":

money in the world and blew it."}, {"time": 13638, "text": "And he could have been the business case example of that."}, {"time": 13642, "text": "But the things that he was doing, space exploration, electrification of transportation, solar city type things, these are big world level things."}, {"time": 13654, "text": "And I have a great deal of admiration that he was willing to throw himself so completely into that because in contrast with myself, I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded, it was John's crazy money at the time that had a finite limit on it."}, {"time": 13671, "text": "It was never going to impact me or my family if it completely failed."}, {"time": 13676, "text": "And I was still hedging my bets, working at id Software at the time when he had been really all in there."}, {"time": 13684, "text": "And I have a huge amount of respect for that."}, {"time": 13688, "text": "And people do not, the other thing I get irritated with is people that say, it's like, oh, Elon's just a business guy."}, {"time": 13693, "text": "He just got like, he was gifted the money and he's just kind of investing in all of this when he was really deeply involved in a lot of the decisions."}, {"time": 13704, "text": "Not all of them were perfect, but he cared very much about engine material selection, propellant selection."}, {"time": 13711, "text": "And for years he'd be kind of telling me, it's like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff."}, {"time": 13717, "text": "It's like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer for this."}, {"time": 13721, "text": "And the times that I've gone through the factories with him, we're talking very detailed things about like how this weld is made, how this sub assembly goes together, what are like startup shut down behaviors of the different things."}, {"time": 13738, "text": "So he is really in there at a very detailed level."}, {"time": 13743, "text": "And I think that he is the best modern example now of someone that tries to, that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree where he cares enough about it."}, {"time": 13756, "text": "I worry a lot that he stretched too thin that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter and all the other possible things there where I know I've got limits on how much I can pay attention to that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time."}, {"time": 13774, "text": "And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things, it's like, I did not go all in on that."}, {"time": 13778, "text": "I did not commit myself at a level that it would have taken to be successful there."}, {"time": 13783, "text": "And I, yeah, and it's kind of a weird thing just like having a discussion with him."}, {"time": 13789,

you think we're gonna put a human on Mars?"}, {"time": 13816, "text": "Like, what do you think is the interesting?"}, {"time": 13820, "text": "No, I do, in fact, I made a bet with someone with a group of people kind of this about whether boots on Mars by 2030."}, {"time": 13828, "text": "And this was kind of a fun story because I was at an Intel sponsored event and we had a bunch of just world class, brilliant people."}, {"time": 13837, "text": "And we were talking about computing stuff, but the after dinner conversation was like, what are some other things?"}, {"time": 13842, "text": "How are they gonna go in the future?"}, {"time": 13843, "text": "And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard was like boots on Mars by 2030."}, {"time": 13849, "text": "And most of the people in the room thought, yes, I thought that like, SpaceX is kicking ass."}, {"time": 13854, "text": "We've got all this possible stuff."}, {"time": 13857, "text": "Seems likely that it's gonna go that way."},

some of the things I said, well, let's be concrete about it."}, {"time": 13881, "text": "Let's bet $10,000 that it's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 13884, "text": "And this was really a startling thing to see that I, again, room full of brilliant people, but as soon as like money came on the line and they were like, do I wanna put 10,000?"}, {"time": 13896, "text": "I was not the richest person in the room."}, {"time": 13898, "text": "There were people much better off than I was."}, {"time": 13901, "text": "There's a spectrum, but as soon as they started thinking, it's like, oh, I could lose money by keeping my position right now."}, {"time": 13910, "text": "And all these engineers, they engaged their brain."}, {"time": 13913, "text": "They started thinking, it's like, okay, launch windows, launch delays, like how many times would it take to get this right?"}, {"time": 13920, "text": "What historical precedents do we have?"}, {"time": 13922, "text": "And then it mostly came down to, it's like, well, what about in transit by 2030?"}, {"time": 13928, "text": "And then what about different things or would you go for 2032?"}, {"time": 13933, "text": "But one of the people did go ahead and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me."}, {"time": 13938, "text": "So I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030, I think it's gonna happen shortly thereafter."}, {"time": 13944, "text": "I

50% chance, so I felt safe making that bet."}, {"time": 13956, "text": "Well, I think you had an interesting point."}, {"time": 13961, "text": "That's a dark one."}, {"time": 13962, "text": "That

specific skill to compartmentalize our true self separately, but make that true self the true identity."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "So then we can still live and act and effectively carry out our cover

need, retain it, remember it, but then return to our true self when we get back to a position of safety."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "Is it possible to do that?"}, {"time": 4624, "text": "So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions, which makes it very easy."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "Like if you're not lying, it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist, but also to communicate a kind of authenticity and a genuineness, which I think is really important."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "Like trust and integrity around trust is extremely important to me."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "It's the thing that opens doors and maintains relationships."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "And I tend to think, like when I was in Ukraine, so many doors just opened to the very high security areas and everywhere else too."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "Like I've just interacted with some incredible people without any kind of

person."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "But you're saying as a CIA agent, you have to remember that you are there to collect information."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "Do you think that gives you away?"},

an artificial relationship, there's ways to bypass all of that and get right to the heart of making someone feel comfortable and safe."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "I guess the question I'm asking and

in there."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "And then they start asking you questions, baseline questions at first, and then other questions from there."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "And you're just answering the best you can."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "And you never know what they're seeing and you don't know what they're doing."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "And it's really hard not to get anxious of that

6047, "text": "They have information superiority."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "You're the idiot looking away from them or looking sideways of them and trying not to move because you're afraid that if you like have gas or if you move a little bit, it's gonna bury you from your baseline."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "And the whole time you're worried, your heart's racing and your blood pressure's increasing, which is a variance from baseline."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "So yeah, that means it's an interesting art."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "Or your baseline."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "Maybe there's some people that are just chilling the whole time and that's their baseline."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "But that's what they're doing."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "They're establishing a baseline."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "I mean, I guess that means the polygraph is a skill that you develop to do it well."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So when people talk about beating a lie detector, it's not that they're telling an effective lie."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "That's not hard."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "And the interviewer doesn't care if you're being honest or not honest about a topic."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "What they're looking for is sensitivity."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "If you show sensitivity to many things, then that's a sign

skill."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "But yeah, it's the misnomers, the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "You also mentioned personality tests."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "So how effective are personality tests?"}, {"time": 6134, "text": "One for the hiring process, but also for understanding a human being."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "So personality is extremely important for understanding human being."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And I would say that there's a thousand different ways of looking at personality."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "And the MBTI is what all the leading spy

big arguments is that people say that your personality can change over time."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "Your core personality does not change because your core personality is defined as your personality when all resources are removed."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "So essentially, your emergency mode, your dire

on."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "That's the best thing that you can do essentially outside of trying to out hack the hackers."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "And then even in your intelligence and military

offensive techniques that have no security built around them yet."}, {"time": 7403, "text": "Because it's too cost and time intensive to protect against what you know is coming, it's so much more efficient and cost effective to go after new vectors."}, {"time": 7412, "text": "So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly game of your neighbor gets a guard dog."}, {"time": 7421, "text": "So you get a bigger guard dog."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "And then your neighbor gets a fence."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "So you're just constantly outdoing each other."}, {"time": 7426, "text":

always trying to outdo each other."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "Yeah, then maybe like banks have to fight that fight, but not everybody can."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "So you're saying I operated at the state of the art with the trip wires."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "This is good to know."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "Absolutely, man."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "And also just not using anybody else's services, doing everything myself."}, {"time": 7452, "text": "So that's harder to figure out what the heck this person is doing."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "Because if I'm using somebody else's service, like I did with QNAP, I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage of unimportant things, but a large videos."}, {"time": 7467, "text": "And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company that does NAS storage devices, and they got hacked."}, {"time": 7474, "text": "And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago from the point of the zero day hack, everybody got hacked."}, {"time": 7482,

QNAP can get all the data back for their customers if they pay, I think, two million dollars."}, {"time": 7501, "text": "But that came from me relying on the systems of others for security."},

intelligence organizations to produce a superior product."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "When that light got shown down, that's when you also saw Trump start to go after, if you remember, there was a period where he was taking security clearances away from retiring officers."}, {"time": 8346, "text": "That became a big hot issue."}, {"time": 8348, "text": "That became something that people were very opposed to when they didn't realize that that process of taking security clearances away, that incentivized seasoned senior officers to stay in service."}, {"time": 8361, "text": "Because with private intelligence paying a premium during the Trump administration, because Trump was paying a premium to the private intelligence world, when senior officers found that it was more profitable to retire early, keep their clearance, and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that as bypassing service to the American people."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "You've made a career in CIA, you've made a career

that."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "And unfortunately, the narrative that came out in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump, when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service to the American people, trying to take away the incentive of senior officials leaving their service in order to just profiteer in the private intelligence."}, {"time": 8410, "text": "So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA in making sure that competent people and experienced people stay in CIA, are incentivized to stay there."}, {"time": 8424, "text": "Correct, I think that there was definitely, he understood incentives."}, {"time": 8429, "text": "I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives."}, {"time": 8432, "text": "So he was trying to incentivize them to stay, but I think he was also playing a safety card because he didn't want former CIA officials who were not listening to him to then move into private intel organizations that he may be hiring, only to then have them undermine him from both sides of the coin."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "So there was a little bit of offensive calculation in there as well."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics that you referred to that the private intelligence operates under, is that more or less ethical than the forces that maybe government agencies operate under?"}, {"time": 8468, "text": "Is capitalism

intelligence?"}, {"time": 8486, "text": "The question of ethics is a great question."}, {"time": 8487, "text": "So let me start this whole thing out by saying, CIA hires people on a spectrum of our

another person."}, {"time": 8525, "text": "So what CIA looks for is people who are able to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?"}, {"time": 8532, "text": "More flexibility."},

of that customer base dictate certain requirements, the company has to adapt to those requirements in order to continue to scale."}, {"time": 8569, "text": "So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ or

their customer base."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "That's such an interesting question because you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies, and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye."}, {"time": 8600, "text": "And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved, at least historically speaking."}, {"time": 8606, "text": "And so you start to wonder, well, can intelligence agencies use some of the same methods or can these use some of the same technique to manipulate the public, like what they believe about those agencies in order to maximize profit as well?"}, {"time": 8625, "text": "Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths that allow you to not be ultimately responsible to the customer."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "And I would go a step further to say that the covert nature of intelligence operations is really attractive when it comes to the private sector, because now they have all the same money with none of the oversight, and all they have to do is deliver."},

something succeed, we all know that there come those times where you have to skirt the boundaries of propriety or morality or commitments or promises to other people, because at the end of the day, if your business fails, it's on you."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "So if you promise to deliver something to a client, you've got to deliver it to the client, even if that means you stay up late or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be, there's a certain level of do or die."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view that ultimately the best way is to stay within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "If you want to be a company that's extremely successful, is win with competence, not with cheating, because

also say that the complexities of what makes somebody make a decision can only really be properly calculated with a baseline."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "So because there is no baseline that you or I
