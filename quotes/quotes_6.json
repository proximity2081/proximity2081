equivalent of engineering of our brains."}, {"time": 419, "text": "So I don't think there's anything mysterious in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do."}, {"time": 424, "text": "I think it's possible in principle."}, {"time": 431, "text": "Whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems, but whether we even want to, whether that's even a sensible goal."}, {"time": 442, "text": "That is, you can ask the question, is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human?"}, {"time": 449, "text": "Well, we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion."}, {"time": 455, "text": "There's no reason that humans should be our benchmark."}, {"time": 455, "text": "They're tools that might be better in some ways."}, {"time": 459, "text": "It may be that we can't duplicate a natural system because at some point it's so much cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brainpower and resources."}, {"time": 474, "text": "So for example, we don't really have an exact substitute for wood."}, {"time": 474, "text": "We still build houses out of wood."}, {"time": 480, "text": "We still build furniture out of wood."}, {"time": 480, "text": "We like the look."}, {"time": 480, "text": "We like the feel."}, {"time": 480, "text": "It has certain properties that synthetics don't."}, {"time": 485, "text": "It's not that there's anything magical or mysterious about wood."}, {"time": 491, "text": "It's just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just haven't bothered because we have wood."}, {"time": 497, "text": "Likewise, say cotton."}, {"time": 497, "text": "I'm wearing cotton clothing now."}, {"time": 497, "text": "It feels much better than polyester."}, {"time": 501, "text": "It's not that cotton has something magic in it."}, {"time": 501, "text": "It's not that we couldn't ever synthesize something exactly like cotton, but at some point it's just not worth it."}, {"time": 509, "text": "We've got cotton."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Likewise, in the case of human intelligence, the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter end, I suspect, because if you want tools that do things better than humans, you're not going to care whether it does something like humans."}, {"time": 533, "text": "So for example, diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather, why set humans as your benchmark?"}, {"time": 538, "text": "But in general, I suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we don't want to imitate humans in their system, there's a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human."}, {"time": 555, "text": "Yeah, I think that's right."}, {"time": 555, "text": "In the same way that to build flying machines, we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics, including birds, but not mimic the birds, but they're the same laws."}, {"time": 567, "text": "You have a view on AI, artificial intelligence, and safety that, from my perspective, is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly, has elements of positivity to it, which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing."}, {"time": 593, "text": "For many people, including AI researchers, the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious, not only possible, but obvious."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And for many others, including AI researchers, the threat is not obvious."}, {"time": 605, "text": "So Elon Musk is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp, saying things like AI is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons, and that AI will likely destroy human civilization."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Human civilization."}, {"time": 621, "text": "So in February, he said that if Elon was really serious about AI, the threat of AI, he would stop building self driving cars that he's doing very successfully as part of Tesla."}, {"time": 635, "text": "Then he said, wow, if even Pinker doesn't understand the difference between narrow AI, like a car and general AI, when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open ended utility function, humanity is in deep trouble."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So first, what did you mean by the statement about Elon Musk should stop building self driving cars if he's deeply concerned?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "Not the last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Well, we live in a world where Twitter has power."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Yeah, I think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence, and I think that they're both incoherent."}, {"time": 680, "text": "One of them is a vague fear of AI takeover, that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced peoples, so if we build something that's more advanced than us, it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents."}, {"time": 728, "text": "There's no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its goals."}, {"time": 733, "text": "Its goals will be whatever we set its goals as, and as long as someone isn't building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence, then there's no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Now, you might say, well, what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "That's a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system."}, {"time": 748, "text": "You don't give it that goal."}, {"time": 754, "text": "I mean, that's just self evidently idiotic."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So if you look at the history of the world, there's been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because that's the natural process of engineering."}, {"time": 769, "text": "Well, except for weapons."}, {"time": 769, "text": "I mean, if you're building a weapon, its goal is to destroy people, and so I think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons."}, {"time": 773, "text": "I think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake."}, {"time": 778, "text": "So maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats."}, {"time": 786, "text": "Do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on?"}, {"time": 792, "text": "Or do you think it's just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "Do you think it's possible to stop?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "I guess is the question."}, {"time": 799, "text": "It's hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of World War II and the fear that the Nazis might develop one first."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Then once it was initiated for that reason, it was hard to turn off, especially since winning the war against the Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that there's just nothing that people wouldn't have done then to ensure victory."}, {"time": 827, "text": "It's quite possible if World War II hadn't happened that nuclear weapons wouldn't have been invented."}, {"time": 861, "text": "I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things."}, {"time": 865, "text": "The point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things."}, {"time": 870, "text": "So the analogy is misleading."}, {"time": 876, "text": "So there's two artificial intelligence you mentioned."}, {"time": 876, "text": "The first one I guess is highly intelligent or power hungry."}, {"time": 882, "text": "Yeah, it's a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals."}, {"time": 882, "text": "Goals are external to the means to attain the goals."}, {"time": 886, "text": "If we don't design an artificially intelligent system to maximize dominance, then it won't maximize dominance."}, {"time": 895, "text": "It's just that we're so familiar with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together, particularly in men, that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power, but that's just an error."}, {"time": 915, "text": "The other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it, it turns us into paper clips."}, {"time": 927, "text": "We'll give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world peace is no people, therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Now I think these are utterly fanciful."}, {"time": 943, "text": "In fact, I think they're actually self defeating."}, {"time": 972, "text": "I think that the collateral damage scenario, the value alignment problem is also based on a misconception."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So one of the challenges, of course, we don't know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "Of course, those things can change overnight, but at this time, theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So that's probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things."}, {"time": 999, "text": "But let me sort of ask, what do you think was the motivation, the thought process of Elon Musk?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "I build autonomous vehicles, I study autonomous vehicles, I study Tesla autopilot."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "I think it is one of the greatest currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It has potentially a very positive impact on society."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So how does a person who's creating this very good quote unquote narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI?"}, {"time": 1030, "text": "What do you think is the motivation there?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "What do you think is the thing?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Well, you probably have to ask him, but there, and he is notoriously flamboyant, impulsive to the, as we have just seen, to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So I don't know what's going on in his mind."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "You probably have to ask him, but I don't think the, and I don't think the distinction between special purpose AI and so called general AI is relevant that in the same way that special purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "All engineering systems are designed to trade off across multiple goals."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "When we build cars in the first place, we didn't forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "It occurred to people, yes, you want it to go fast, but not always."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So you would build in brakes too."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "Likewise, if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport, it's not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that's the shortest route."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "That's not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And that's just what an intelligence system is by definition."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "It takes into account multiple constraints."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "The same is true, in fact, even more true of so called general intelligence."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "That is, if it's genuinely intelligent, it's not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly, omitting every other consideration and collateral effect."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "That's not artificial and general intelligence."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "That's artificial stupidity."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "I agree with you, by the way, on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "I think it's spectacular."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And I'm surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the United States alone, something like 40,000 people die every year on the highways, vastly more than are killed by terrorists."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism, about half a dozen a year."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Whereas year in, year out, 40,000 people are massacred on the highways, which could be brought down to very close to zero."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So I'm with you on the humanitarian benefit."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Let me just mention that as a person who's building these cars, it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "I often stay up at night thinking about those 40,000 people that are dying."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And everything I tried to engineer is to save those people's lives."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So every new invention that I'm super excited about, in all the deep learning literature and CVPR conferences and NIPS, everything I'm super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So I just don't see how that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "You and I certainly agree on that."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "And I think that's only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "There's been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence, but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are horrible jobs."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "The fact that people aren't going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal, these are soul deadening jobs."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "And we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial, mind deadening, dangerous jobs."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "If we can eliminate them, this is a fantastic boon to humanity."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Now granted, you solve one problem and there's another one, namely, how do we get these people a decent income?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "But if we're smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients, I think we're smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Sam Harris says that it's obvious that eventually AI will be an existential risk."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "He's one of the people who says it's obvious."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "We don't know when the claim goes, but eventually it's obvious."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And because we don't know when, we should worry about it now."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "This is a very interesting argument in my eyes."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So how do we think about timescale?"}, {"time": 1305, "text": "How do we think about existential threats when we don't really, we know so little about the threat, unlike nuclear weapons perhaps, about this particular threat, that it could happen tomorrow, right?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "So, but very likely it won't."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Very likely it'd be a hundred years away."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "So how do we ignore it?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "How do we talk about it?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Do we worry about it?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "How do we think about those?"}, {"time": 1332, "text": "What is it?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "A threat that we can imagine."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It's within the limits of our imagination, but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "But what is the it that we're afraid of?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "AI being the existential threat."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "Like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris perspective would be the paperclip situation."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "I mean, I just think it's totally fanciful."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "I mean, that is don't build a system."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "Don't give a, don't, first of all, the code of engineering is you don't implement a system with massive control before testing it."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Now, perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Then I would worry, but I don't see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things, like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they haven't tested first."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Or all of these scenarios, not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence, including things like cure cancer, which is probably an incoherent goal because there's so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "I mean, how do you even specify that as a goal?"}, {"time": 1405, "text": "But the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe, which not only is itself unlikely, but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Now, maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibility implemented so that engineers don't do things that are stupid by their own standards."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But the, I've never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brain power to, to forestall it."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So you believe in the sort of the power on mass of the engineering of reason, as you argue in your latest book of Reason and Science, to sort of be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so it's safe and also keeps us safe."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "You know, granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes, for example."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So yeah, I don't think that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented, but there's no reason to think they are."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And in fact, if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence, it's been, you know, it's been impressive, especially in the last 10 years or so, but the idea that suddenly there'll be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it, it will be all powerful, that there'll be some kind of recursive self improvement, some kind of fume is also fanciful."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "We, certainly by the technology that we, that we're now impresses us, such as deep learning, where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples, they're not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years are not the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I think it's kind of a magical thinking."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "It's not based on our understanding of how AI actually works."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Now give me a chance here."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "So you said fanciful, magical thinking."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "In his TED talk, Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow fun, intellectually."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "Now I have to say as a scientist engineer, I don't find it fun, but when I'm having beer with my non AI friends, there is indeed something fun and appealing about it."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Like talking about an episode of Black Mirror, considering if a large meteor is headed towards Earth, we were just told a large meteor is headed towards Earth, something like this."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And can you relate to this sense of fun?"}, {"time": 1580, "text": "And do you understand the psychology of it?"}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I personally don't find it fun."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics, like cyber security vulnerabilities, like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "You know, this is enough to fill many conversations."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And I think Sam did put his finger on something, namely that there is a community, sometimes called the rationality community, that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals, to less cerebral people."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "So there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "I actually think, though, that it's not only is it a kind of fun that doesn't give me particular pleasure, but I think there can be a pernicious side to it, namely that you overcome people with such dread, such fatalism, that there are so many ways to die, to annihilate our civilization, that we may as well enjoy life while we can."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "There's nothing we can do about it."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "If climate change doesn't do us in, then runaway robots will."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "So let's enjoy ourselves now."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "We've got to prioritize."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "We have to look at threats that are close to certainty, such as climate change, and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And we have to take into account people's worry budget."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "You can't worry about everything."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism, it can lead to a kind of numbness."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Well, these problems are overwhelming, and the engineers are just going to kill us all."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So let's either destroy the entire infrastructure of science, technology, or let's just enjoy life while we can."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So there's a certain line of worry, which I'm worried about a lot of things in engineering."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "There's a certain line of worry when you cross, you're allowed to cross, that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And that's kind of what you're highlighting."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And we've seen some, we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability, not by data."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "And so we misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism, which kills on average about six Americans a year with one exception of 9 11."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "We invade countries, we invent entire new departments of government with massive, massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Whereas guaranteed risks, one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are not here, but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics, like nuclear war, receive far too little attention."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "In presidential debates, there's no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "Lots of discussion of terrorism, for example."}, {"time": 1791, "text":

imagination is Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "So who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way."}, {"time":

matter, but are people yelling at each other?"}, {"time": 344, "text": "Like that's not the purpose of this kind of communication."}, {"time": 346, "text": "So I would say leadership is about setting an example, doing the things that represent what you want to be, and making sure that you're actually doing those things."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And there's a trick to that too, because the things you don't do also say a lot about what you are."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Yeah, so let's pause on that one."}, {"time": 363, "text": "So those two things are fascinating."}, {"time": 365, "text": "So how do you have as a leader that self awareness?"}, {"time": 368, "text": "So you just said it's really hard to be self aware."}, {"time": 370, "text": "So for you personally, or maybe for other leaders you've seen or look up to, how do you know both that the things you're doing are the wrong things to be doing, the way you speak to others, the way you behave, and the things you're not doing?"}, {"time": 383, "text": "How do you get that signal?"}, {"time": 384, "text": "I think there's two aspects to that."}, {"time": 386, "text": "One is like processing feedback that you're getting, so."}, {"time": 389, "text": "How do you get feedback?"}, {"time": 390, "text": "Well, right, so are you getting feedback, right?"}, {"time": 392, "text": "So one way we do it, for example, with discourse, we have three cofounders, and we periodically talk about decisions before we make them."}, {"time": 398, "text": "So it's not like one person can make a mistake, or like, wow, there can be misunderstandings, things like that."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So it's part of like group consensus of leadership is like it's good to have, I think systems where there's one leader, and that leader has the rule of absolute law are just really dangerous in my experience."}, {"time": 413, "text": "For communities, for example, like if you have a community that's run by one person, that one person makes all the decisions, that person's gonna have a bad day."}, {"time": 419, "text": "Something could happen to that person, something, there's a lot of variables."}, {"time": 423, "text": "So like first, when you think about leadership, have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So giving each other feedback about the decisions that they're making."}, {"time": 432, "text": "And then when you do get feedback, I think there's that little voice in your head, right?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "Or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body."}, {"time": 439, "text": "I think that voice is really important."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do, most people want to do the right thing."}, {"time": 447, "text": "I do believe that."}, {"time": 448, "text": "I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that don't, but most people, they want other people to think of them as a good person."}, {"time": 454, "text": "And why wouldn't you, right?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Like, do you want people to despise you?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "I mean, that's just weird, right?"}, {"time": 458, "text": "So you have that little voice that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder sort of talking to you about like what you're doing, how you're doing, how does it make you feel to make these decisions, right?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "And I think having some attunement to that voice is important."}, {"time": 470, "text": "But you said that voice also for, I think this is a programmer situation too, where sometimes the devil on the shoulder is a little too loud."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So you're a little too self critical for a lot of developers, and especially when you have introverted personality."}, {"time": 485, "text": "How do you struggle with a self criticism or the criticism of others?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "So one of the things of leadership is to do something that's potentially unpopular or where people doubt you and you still go through with the decision."}, {"time": 498, "text": "So what's that balance like?"}, {"time": 501, "text": "I think you have to walk people through your decision making, right?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "Like you have to, this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Again, code language is just another kind of code."}, {"time": 507, "text": "It's like, here is the program by which I arrived at the conclusion that I'm gonna reach, right?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "It's one thing to say like, this is a decision, it's final, deal with it, right?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "That's not usually satisfying to people."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But if you say, look, we've been thinking about this problem for a while."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Here's some stuff that's happened."}, {"time": 522, "text": "Here's what we think is right."}, {"time": 523, "text": "Here's our goals."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Here's what we wanna achieve."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And we've looked at these options and we think this available options is the best option."}, {"time": 530, "text": "People will be like, oh, okay, right?"}, {"time": 532, "text": "Maybe I don't totally agree with you, but I can kind of see where you're coming from and I see it's not just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky, right?"}, {"time": 540, "text": "It's like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And their goals might be different than yours."}, {"time": 545, "text": "That's completely legit, right?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "But if you're making that clear, it's like, oh, well, the reason we don't agree is because we have totally different goals, right?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Like, how could we agree?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "It's not that you're a bad person."}, {"time": 554, "text": "It's that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at this problem."}, {"time": 558, "text": "And the other one you said is passion."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So, or hard work, sorry."}, {"time": 562, "text": "Well, those are tied together in my mind."}, {"time": 564, "text": "Let's say hard work and passion."}, {"time": 564, "text": "Like for me, like I just really love the problem discourse is setting out to solve because in a way it's like, there's a vision of the world where it all devolves into Facebook basically owning everything and every aspect of human communication, right?"}, {"time": 577, "text": "And this has always been kind of a scary world for me."}, {"time": 579, "text": "First, cause I don't, I think Facebook is really good at execution."}, {"time": 582, "text": "I got to compliment them."}, {"time": 583, "text": "They're very competent in terms of what they're doing, but Facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of Facebook cares about Facebook, really."}, {"time": 590, "text": "They don't really care about you and your problems."}, {"time": 593, "text": "What they care about is how big they can make Facebook, right?"}, {"time": 596, "text": "Is that you talking about the company or just the mechanism of how Facebook works?"}, {"time": 599, "text": "Kind of both really, right?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "Like, and the idea with discourse, the reason I'm so passionate about it is cause I believe every community should have the right to own themselves, right?"}, {"time": 607, "text": "Like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them."}, {"time": 610, "text": "That's their space where they can set the rules."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And if they don't like it, they can move to different hosting or, you know, whatever they need to happen can happen."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But like this idea of a company town where all human communication is implicitly owned by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And it's really disturbing too, cause Facebook is really smart."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Like I said, they're great at execution."}, {"time": 628, "text": "Buying in WhatsApp and buying Instagram were incredibly smart decisions."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And they also do this thing, I don't know if you know, but they have this VPN software that they give away for free on smartphones and it indirectly feeds all the data about the traffic back to Facebook."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So they can see what's actually getting popular through the VPNs, right?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "They have low level access to the network data because users have let them have that."}, {"time": 651, "text": "So let's take a small pause here."}, {"time": 654, "text": "First of all, discourse."}, {"time": 655, "text": "Can you talk about, can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "So there's Stack Overflow that you've built."}, {"time": 663, "text": "There's discourse."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So Stack Overflow is kind of like a Wiki, Wikipedia you talk about."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And it's a very specific scalpel, very focused."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So what is the purpose of discourse and maybe contrast that with Facebook?"}, {"time": 676, "text": "First of all, say, what is discourse?"}, {"time": 678, "text": "Start from the beginning."}, {"time": 679, "text": "Well, let me start from the very beginning."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So Stack Overflow is a very structured Wiki style Q and A for programmers, right?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "And that was the problem we first worked on."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And when we started, we thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and other things, but we quickly realized we were doing Q and A, which is a very narrow subset of human communication, right?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "Sorry, so when you started Stack Overflow, you thought you didn't even know the Q and A."}, {"time": 702, "text": "You didn't know it would be Q and A."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Well, we didn't know."}, {"time": 704, "text": "We had an idea of like, okay, these are things that we see working online."}, {"time": 706, "text": "We had a goal, right?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "Our goal was there was this site, Experts Exchange, with a very unfortunate name."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Thank you for killing that site."}, {"time": 713, "text": "Yeah, I know, right?"}, {"time": 714, "text": "Like a lot of people don't remember it anymore, which is great."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Like that's the measure of success when people don't remember the thing that you were trying to replace, then you've totally won."}, {"time": 722, "text": "So it was a place to get answers to programming questions, but it wasn't clear if it was like focused Q and A, if it was a discussion."}, {"time": 728, "text": "There were plenty of programming forums."}, {"time": 730, "text": "So we weren't really sure."}, {"time": 731, "text": "We were like, okay, we'll take aspects of dig and Reddit, like voting were very important."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Reordering answers based on votes."}, {"time": 737, "text": "Wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts, not just your posts, but other people's posts to make them better and keep them more up to date."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Ownership of blogging of like, okay, this is me."}, {"time": 746, "text": "I'm saying this in my voice, this is the stuff that I know."}, {"time": 749, "text": "And your reputation accrues to you and it's peer recognition."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So you asked earlier, like what motivates programmers?"}, {"time": 757, "text": "I think peer recognition motivates them a lot."}, {"time": 760, "text": "That was one of the key insights of Stack Overflow was like recognition from your peers is why things get done."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Not necessarily money, not necessarily your boss, but like your peers saying, wow, this person really knows their stuff, has a lot of value."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So the reputation system came from that."}, {"time": 773, "text": "So we were sort of Frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in Stack Overflow, like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked and that became Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Over time, we realized it wasn't really discussion."}, {"time": 786, "text": "It was very focused questions and answers."}, {"time": 788, "text": "There wasn't a lot of room on the page for let me talk about this tangential thing."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It was more like, okay, is it answering the question?"}, {"time": 794, "text": "Is it clarifying the question?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "Or could it be an alternative answer to the same question?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "Because there's usually more than one way to do it in programming, there's like say five to 10 ways."}, {"time": 802, "text": "And one of the patterns we got into early on with Stack Overflow was there were questions where there would be like hundreds of answers."}, {"time": 808, "text": "And we're like, wow, how can there be a programming question with 500, 200, 500 answers?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "And we looked at those and we realized those were not really questions in the traditional sense."}, {"time": 818, "text": "They were discussions."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasn't allowed such as what's your favorite programming food?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "What's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like, why isn't this allowed?"}, {"time": 833, "text": "Such as, is this a real problem you're facing?"}, {"time": 835, "text": "Like nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can't work cause I don't know what the funniest programming cartoon is."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So sorry, can't compile this code now, right?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "It's not a real problem you're facing in your job."}, {"time": 844, "text": "So that was run rule."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And the second, like, what can you really learn from that?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "It's like what I call accidental learning or Reddit style learning."}, {"time": 850, "text": "Where you're just like, oh, I'll just browse some things and oh, wow, you know, did you know tree frogs only live three years?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "I mean, I just made that up."}, {"time": 856, "text": "I don't know if that's true."}, {"time": 856, "text": "But I didn't really set out to learn that."}, {"time": 858, "text": "I don't need to know that, right?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "It's accidental learning."}, {"time": 861, "text": "It was more intentional learning where you're like, okay, I have a problem."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And I want to learn about stuff around this problem having, right?"}, {"time": 867, "text": "And it could be theory, it could be compiler theory, it could be other stuff, but I'm having a compiler problem."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Hence, I need to know the compiler theory, that aspect of it that gets me to my answer, right?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "So kind of a directed learning."}, {"time": 879, "text": "So we had to backfill all these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And the system came very strict over time."}, {"time": 885, "text": "And a lot of people still complain about that."}, {"time": 886, "text": "And I wrote my latest blog entry, what does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "Celebrating the 10 year anniversary, yeah."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Yeah, so 10 years."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And the system has trended towards strictness."}, {"time": 897, "text": "There's a variety of reasons for this."}, {"time": 898, "text": "One is people don't like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous, which I can actually understand."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in code, it's like, well, why do they have that reputation?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "Is it because they wrote the joke?"}, {"time": 915, "text": "I mean, if they did, maybe, or the cartoon, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "They're getting a bunch of reputation based on someone else's work that's not even programming."}, {"time": 922, "text": "It's just a joke, right?"}, {"time": 923, "text": "It's related to programming."}, {"time": 924, "text": "So you begin to resent that."}, {"time": 926, "text": "You're like, well, that's not fair."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And it isn't."}, {"time": 928, "text": "At some level, they're correct."}, {"time": 929, "text": "I mean, I empathize."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Because it's not correct to get reputation for that."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Versus here's a really gnarly regular expression problem."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And here's a really clever, insightful, detailed answer laying out, oh, here's why you're seeing the behavior that you're seeing."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Here, let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future."}, {"time": 945, "text": "That's gold, right?"}, {"time": 946, "text": "You want people to get reputation for that, not so much for, wow, look at this funny thing I saw, right?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "So there's this very specific Q&A format."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And then take me through the journey towards discourse and Facebook and Twitter."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So you started at the beginning that Stack Overflow evolved to have a purpose."}, {"time": 962, "text": "So what is discourse, this passion you have for creating community for discussion?"}, {"time": 970, "text": "When was that born and how?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "Well, part of it is based on the realization that Stack Overflow is only good for very specific subjects where it's based on data, facts, and science, where answers can be kind of verified to be true."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Another form of that is there's the book of knowledge, like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is."}, {"time": 988, "text": "You can refer to that book and it'll give you the answer."}, {"time": 990, "text": "There has to be, it only works on subjects where there's like semi clear answers to things that can be verified in some form."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Now again, there's always more than one way to do it."}, {"time": 999, "text": "There's complete flexibility and system around that."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "But where it falls down is stuff like poker and LEGO."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Like we had, if you go to stackexchange.com, we have an engine that tries to launch different Q&A topics, right?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And people can propose Q&A topics, sample questions, and if it gets enough support within the network, we launched that Q&A site."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So some of the ones we launched were poker and LEGO and they did horribly, right?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Because I mean, they might still be there lingering on in some form, but it was an experiment."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "This is like a test, right?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And some subjects work super well on the stack engine and some don't."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "But the reason LEGO and poker don't work is because they're so social, really."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's not about what's the rule here in poker."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "It's like, well, what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "Or what's a cool set of cards to use when I'm playing poker?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Or what's some strategies?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Say I have this hand come up with some strategies I could use."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It's more of a discussion around what's happening with LEGO."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Same thing, here's this cool LEGO set I found."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Look how awesome this is."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And I'm like, yeah, that's freaking awesome, right?"}, {"time": 1058, "text": "It's not a question, right?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "There's all these social components and discussions that don't fit at all."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "We literally have to disallow those in Stack Overflow because it's not about being social."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's about problems that you're facing in your work that you need concrete answers for."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "You have a real demonstrated problem that's blocking you in something."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Nobody's blocked by, what should I do when I have a straight flush?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "It's not a blocking problem in the world."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "It's just an opportunity to hang out and discuss."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So discourse was a way to address that and say, look, discussion forum software was very, very bad."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And when I came out of Stack Overflow in early 2012, it was still very, very bad."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I expected it improved in the four years since I last looked, but it had not improved at all."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And I was like, well, that's kind of terrible because I love these communities of people talking about things that they love."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "They're just communities of interest, right?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And there's no good software for them."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Startups would come to me and say, hey, Jeff, I want to have this startup."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "Here's my idea."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And the first thing I would say to them is, well, first, why are you asking me?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "I don't really know your field necessarily."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Why aren't you asking the community, the people that are interested in this problem, the people that are using your product, why aren't you talking to them?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And then they'd say, oh, great idea."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "How do I do that?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And then that's when I started playing sad trombone because I realized all the software involving talking to your users, customers, audience, patrons, whatever it is, it was all really bad."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "It was stuff that I would be embarrassed to recommend to other people."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And yet, that's where I felt they could get the biggest and strongest, most effective input for what they should be doing with their product, right?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "It's from their users, from their community, right?"}, {"time": 1157, "text": "That's what we did on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So what we're talking about with forums, the, what is it, the dark matter of the internet, it's still, I don't know if it's still, but for the longest time, it has some of the most passionate and fascinating discussions."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And what's the usual structure?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "There's usually, it's linear, so it's sequential."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "So you're posting one after the other and there's pagination, so it's every, there's 10 posts and then you go to the next page."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And that format still is used by, like I'm, we're doing a lot of research with Tesla vehicles and there's a Tesla Motors Club forum, which is extremely."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "We really wanted to run that actually."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "They pinged us about it, I don't think we got it, but I really would have liked to gotten that one."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But they've started before even 2012, I believe."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I mean, they've been running for a long time."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's still an extremely rich source of information."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So what's broken about that system and how are you trying to fix it?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "I think there's a lot of power in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Meaning Facebook's idea of connection is just any human that's related to another human, right?"}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Like through friendship or any other reason."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "Facebook's idea of the world is sort of the status update, right?"}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Like a friend of yours did something, ate at a restaurant, right?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "Whereas discussion forums were traditionally around the interest graph."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Like I love electric cars, specifically I love Tesla, right?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Like I love the way they approach the problem."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "I love the style of the founder."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "I just love the design ethic."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And there's a lot to like about Tesla."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "I don't know if you saw the oatmeal, he did a whole love comic to Tesla."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And it was actually kind of cool because I learned some stuff."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "He was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically, like how they were built differently."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And he went into a lot of great detail that was really interesting."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And to me, that oatmeal post, if you read it, is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I just really love this stuff."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So like for me, for example, there's yo yos, right?"}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Like I'm into the yo yo communities."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And these interest communities are just really fascinating to me."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And I feel more connected to the yo yo communities than I do to friends that I don't see that often, right?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And Facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "I mean, they have groups, you can sign up for groups and stuff, but it's really about the relationship graph."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "Like this is my coworker, this is my relative, this is my friend, but not so much about the interest."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "So I think that's the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that I personally love."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Like I said, leadership is about passion, right?"}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And being passionate about stuff is a really valid way to look at the world."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And I think it's a way a lot of stuff in the world gets done."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "Like I once had someone describe me as, he's like, Jeff, you're a guy who, you just get super passionate about a few things at a time, and you just go super deep in those things."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And I was like, oh, that's kind of right."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "That's kind of what I do."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "I get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or whatever, and just learn all I can about it, and go super deep in it."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And that's how I enjoy experiencing the world, right?"}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Like not being shallow on a bunch of things, but being really deep on a few things that I'm interested in."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So forums kind of unlock that, right?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "And you don't want a world where everything belongs to Facebook, at least I don't."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves, set their own norms, set their own rules, control the experience."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "Because community is also about ownership, right?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Like if you're meeting at the Barnes and Noble every Thursday and Barnes and Noble says, get out of here, you guys don't buy enough books."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Well, you know, you're kind of hosed, right?"}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Barnes and Noble owns you, right?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "Like you can't."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "But if you have your own meeting space, you know, your own clubhouse, you can set your own rules, decide what you want to talk about there, and just really generate a lot better information than you could like hanging out at Barnes and Noble every Thursday at 3 p.m., right?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So that's kind of the vision of Discourse, is a place where it's fully open source."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "You can take the software, you can install it anywhere, and, you know, you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that you're into."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And this works for startups, right?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem, right?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And they want to talk to the community."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "It's like, well, install Discourse, right?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That's what we do at Discourse."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "That's what I did at Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "I spent a lot of time on Meta Stack Overflow, which is our internal, well, public community feedback site, and just experiencing what the users were experiencing, right, because they're the ones doing all the work in the system."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And they had a lot of interesting feedback."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And there's that 90, 10 rule of, like, 90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable for a variety of reasons."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "It might be bad feedback, it might be crazy feedback, it might be feedback you just can't act on right now."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "But there's 10% of it that's like gold."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "It's like literally gold and diamonds, where it's like feedback of really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to and actually make a lot of sense."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff I didn't even see coming."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "It's like, oh my God, I never even thought of that."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "But that's a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "And I can point to so many features of Stack Overflow that we derive from Meta Stack Overflow feedback and Meta discourse, right?"}, {"time": 1438, "text": "Same exact principle of discourse, you know?"}, {"time": 1441, "text": "We're getting ideas from the community."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I was like, oh my God, I never thought of that, but that's fantastic, right?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Like, I love that relationship with the community."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "From having built these communities, what have you learned about?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "What's the process of getting a critical mass of members in a community?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Is it luck, skill, timing, persistence?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "What is, is it the tools, like discourse, that empower that community?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "What's the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal and then building it to two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand and so on?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "I think when you're starting with an N of one, I mean, I think it's persistence and also you have to be interesting."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Like somebody I really admire once said something that I always liked about blogging."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "He's like, here's how you blog."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "You have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of saying it, right?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And then do that for like 10 years."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "So that's the genesis, is like you have to have sort of something interesting to say that's not exactly what everybody else is saying and an interesting way of saying it, which is another way of saying, kind of entertaining way of saying it."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And then as far as growing it, it's like ritual."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "You know, like you have to, like say you're starting a blog, you have to say, look, I'm gonna blog every week, three times a week, and you have to stick to that schedule, right?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "Because until you do that for like several years, you're never gonna get anywhere."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And part of that is having the discipline to stick with the schedule."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And it helps, again, if it's something you're passionate about, this won't feel like work."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "You're like, I love this."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I could talk about this all day, every day, right?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "You just have to do it in a way that's interesting to other people."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And then as you're growing the community, that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these artifacts, like even in the case of blogging, like I felt in the early days of my blog, which I started in 2004, which is really the genesis of Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "If you look at all my blog, it leads up to Stack Overflow, which was, I have all this energy in my blog, but I don't, like 40,000 people were subscribing to me."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And I was like, I wanna do something."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And then I met Joel and said, hey, Joel, I wanna do something, take this ball of energy from my blog and do something."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "And all the people reading my blog saw that."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "It's like, oh, cool."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "You're involving us."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're saying, look, you're part of this community."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Let's build this thing together."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Like they pick the name."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Like we voted on the name for Stack Overflow on my blog."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Like we came up, and naming is super hard."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "First of all, the hardest problem in computer science is coming up with a good name for stuff, right?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "But you can go back to my blog."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "There's the poll where we voted and Stack Overflow became the name of the site."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And all the early beta users of Stack Overflow were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog, right?"}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So we started from, like, if you look at the genesis, okay, I was just a programmer who said, hey, I love programming, but I have no outlet to talk about it."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So I'm just gonna blog about it, because I don't have enough people to work to talk to about it."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "Because at the time I worked a place where, you know, programming wasn't the core output of the company, it was a pharmaceutical company."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "So I was like, I'll just blog about it."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And then I'll find an audience and eventually found an audience, eventually found Joel, and eventually built Stack Overflow from that one core of activity, right?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments, feedback from Joel, feedback from the early Stack Overflow community."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "When people see that you're doing that, they will follow along with you, right?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "They'll say, cool, you're here in good faith."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "You're actually, you know, not listening to everything because that's impossible, that's impossible."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "But you're actually, you know, waiting our feedback and what you're doing."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And why wouldn't I?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Because who does all the work on Stack Overflow?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Me, Joel?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "No, it's the other programmers that are doing all the work."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So you gotta have some respect for that."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And then, you know, discipline around, look, you know, we're trying to do a very specific thing here on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "We're not trying to solve all the world's problems."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "We're trying to solve this very specific Q and A problem in a very specific way."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Not cause we're jerks about it, but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results, right?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And programmers, that's an easy sell for the most part because programmers are used to dealing with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "That's basically their job."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So they're very, oh yeah, super strict system of rules that lets me get what I want."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "That's programming, right?"}, {"time": 1671, "text": "That's what Stack Overflow is, so."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So you're making it sound easy, but in 2004, let's go back there."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "In 2004, you started the blog, Coding Horror."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "Was it called that at the very beginning?"}, {"time": 1684, "text": "One of the smart things I did, it's from a book by Steve McConnell, Code Complete, which is one of my favorite programming books, still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "So one of the smart things I did back then, I don't always do smart things when I start stuff."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I contacted Steve and said, hey, I really like this."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "It was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code, right?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Coding Horror was like, watch out."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And I love that illustration because it spoke to me."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Because I saw that illustration go, oh my God, that's me."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Like I'm always my own worst enemy."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Like that's the key insight in programming is every time you write something, think how am I gonna screw myself?"}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Because you will, constantly, right?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So that icon was like, oh yeah, I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look, and say, look, you're very fallible."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "You're gonna screw this up."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Like how can you build this in such a way that you're not gonna screw it up later?"}, {"time": 1730, "text": "Like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step I'm thinking through all the things that I could do wrong or that other people could do wrong?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times, right?"}, {"time": 1740, "text": "So that sidebar illustration, I loved it so much."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said, hey, can I have permission to use this because I just really like this illustration?"}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that and just continues to give me permission, so yeah."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "Really, that's awesome."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "But in 2004, you started this blog."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "You know, you look at Stephen King, his book on writing, or Stephen Pressfield, War of Art book."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "I mean, it seems like writers suffer."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "I mean, it's a hard process of writing, right?"}, {"time": 1772, "text": "There's gonna be suffering."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "I mean, I won't kid you."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Well, the work is suffering, right?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "Like doing the work, like even when you're every week, you're like, okay, that blog post wasn't very good or people didn't like it or people said disparaging things about it."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "You have to like have the attitude like, you know, no matter what happens, I wanna do this for me, right?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "It's not about you, it's about me."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "I mean, in the end, it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the world."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "But you have to be pretty strict about saying like, you know, I'm selfish in the sense that I have to do this for me."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "You know, you mentioned Stephen King, like his book on writing."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "But like one of the things I do, for example, when writing is like, I read it out loud."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud, like multiple times and make it sound like you're talking because that is the goal of good writing."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "It should sound like you said it with slightly better phrasing because you have more time to think about what you're saying but like, it should sound natural when you say it."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I think that's probably the single best writing advice I can give anyone."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Just read it over and over out loud, make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "And what's your process of writing?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "See, there's usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So ideas, right."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So I think you gotta have the concept that there's so many interesting things in the world."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Like, I mean, my God, the world is amazing, right?"}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Like you can never write about everything that's going on because it's so incredible."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "But if you can't come up with like, let's say one interesting thing per day to talk about, then you're not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super interesting stuff."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And one great way to like mine stuff is go back to old books cause they bring up old stuff that's still super relevant."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "And I did that a lot cause I was like reading classic programming books and a lot of the early blog posts were like, oh, I was reading this programming book and they brought this really cool concept and I wanna talk about it some more."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And you get the, I mean, you're not claiming credit for the idea but it gives you something interesting to talk about that's kind of evergreen, right?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Like you don't have to go, what should I talk about?"}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So we'll just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something that, oh, wow, that's interesting."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Or how does that apply today?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Or what about X and Y or compare these two concepts."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So pull a couple of sentences from that book and then sort of play off of it, almost agree or disagree."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So in 2007, you wrote that you were offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "You chose not to."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "What were all the elements you were thinking about?"}, {"time": 1908, "text": "Cause I'd like to take you back."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "It seems like there's a lot of nonlinear decisions you made through life."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "So what was that decision like?"}, {"time": 1916, "text": "Right, so one of the things I love is the Choose Your Own Adventure books, which I loved as a kid and I feel like they're early programmer books cause they're all about if then statements, right?"}, {"time": 1924, "text": "If this, then this."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "And they're also very, very unforgiving."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Like there's all these sites that map the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books and how many outcomes are bad, a lot of bad outcomes."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So part of the game is like, oh, I got a bad outcome."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Go back one step, go back one further step."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It's like, how did I get here, right?"}, {"time": 1939, "text": "Like it's a sequence of decisions."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "And this is true of life, right?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Like every decision is a sequence, right?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Individually, any individual decision is not necessarily right or wrong, but they lead you down a path, right?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So I do think there's some truth to that."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "So this particular decision, the blog had gotten fairly popular."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "There's a lot of RSS readers that I had discovered."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And this guy contacted me out of the blue from this like bug tracking company."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "He's like, oh, I really wanna buy your blog for like, I think it was around, it was $100,000, it might have been like 80,000, but it was a lot, right?"}, {"time": 1969, "text": "Like, and that's, you know, at the time, like I would have a year's worth of salary all at once."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So I didn't really think about like, well, you know, and I remember talking to people at the time, I was like, wow, that's a lot of money."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "But then I'm like, I really like my blog, right?"}, {"time": 1982, "text": "Like, do I wanna sell my blog?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Cause it wouldn't really belong to me anymore at that point."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "Cause if you pick the safe choice, it's usually, you're not really pushing."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "You're not pushing yourself."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "You're not choosing the thing that's gonna help you grow."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So for me, the scarier choice was to say no."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "I was like, well, no, let's just see where this is going."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Because then I own it."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "I mean, it belongs to me."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It's my thing."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And I can just take it and tell some other logical conclusion, right?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "Because imagine how different the world would have been had I said yes and sold the blog."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "It's like, there probably wouldn't be Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "You know, a lot of other stuff would have changed."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "So for that particular decision, I think it was that same rule."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Like what scares me a little bit more."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "Do the thing that scares you."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So speaking of which, startups."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "I think there's a specific, some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "You've started Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "You started this course."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "So what's the, it was one, two, three guys, whatever it is in the beginning."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "What was that process like?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "Do you start talking about it?"}, {"time": 2060, "text": "Do you start programming?"}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Do you start, like, where's the birth and the catalyst that actually."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Well, I can talk about it in the context of both Stack Overflow and Discourse."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So I think the key thing initially is there is a problem."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Something, there's some state of the world that's unsatisfactory to the point that, like, you're upset about it, right?"}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like, in that case, it was experts exchange."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "I mean, Joel's original idea, because I approached Joel as like, look, Joel, I have all this energy behind my blog."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "I want to do something."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I want to build something."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "But I don't know what it is, because I'm honestly not a good idea person."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "I'm really not."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "I'm like the execution guy."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "I'm really good at execution, but I'm not good at, like, blue skying ideas."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "Not my forte."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "Which is another reason why I like the community feedback, because they blue sky all day long for you, right?"}, {"time": 2096, "text": "So when I can just go in and cherry pick a blue sky idea from community, even if I have to spend three hours reading to get one good idea, it's worth it, man."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "But anyway, so the idea from Joel was, hey, experts exchange, it's got great data, but the experience is hideous, right?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "It's trying to trick you."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "It feels like used car salesman."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "It's just bad."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "So I was like, oh, that's awesome."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "It feeds

galvanize around the idea."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Like, Joel was already super excited about the idea."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "I was excited about the idea."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "So with the forum software, I was posting on Twitter."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "I had researched, as part of my research, I start researching the problem, right?"}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And I found a game

better person to walk through the door and say, I'm excited about this, too."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Same thing with Joel, right?"}, {"time": 2222, "text": "I mean, Joel is a legend in the industry, right?"}, {"time": 2224, "text": "So when he walked through and said, I'm excited about this problem, I was like, me too, man."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "We can do this, right?"}, {"time": 2228, "text": "So that, to me, is the most important step."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "It's like, having an idea you're super excited about, and another person, a cofounder, right?"}, {"time": 2234,

were experimenting."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "That's where people were pushing."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "And they failed, but they probably failed for reasons that weren't directly about the quality of their idea, right?"}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So look at all the failures."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Don't just look what everybody looks at, which is like, oh, gosh, look at all these

questions?"}, {"time": 2326, "text": "It's because there's so much tension that we built into the system around trying to get good, good results out of the system."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "And it's not a free."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "That stuff doesn't come for free, right?"}, {"time": 2337, "text": "It's not like we, we all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their feelings

2349, "text": "You write about anxiety."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "So I've posted a lot of questions and written answers on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "On the question side, you usually go to something very specific to something I'm working on."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "And this is something you talk about that really the goal of Stack Overflow isn't about, is to write a question that's not about you, it's about the question that will help the community in the future."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Right, but that's a tough sell, right?"}, {"time": 2377, "text": "Because people

sort of that, again, that tension, that balancing act of we wanna help you, but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "The long line of people are gonna come up and say, oh, I kinda have that problem too, right?"}, {"time": 2392, "text": "And if nobody's ever gonna come up and say, I have this problem too, then that question shouldn't exist on Stack Overflow

question, the anxiety of answering, that tension is inherent to programmers, is inherent to this kind of process?"}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Or can it be improved?"}, {"time": 2420, "text": "Can it be happy land where that tension is not quite so harsh?"}, {"time": 2426, "text": "I don't think Stack Overflow can totally change the way it works."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "One thing they are working on finally is the ask page had not changed since 2011."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "I'm still kind of bitter about this because I feel like you have a Q&A system and what are the core pages in a Q&A system?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Well, first of all, the question, all the answers and also the ask page, particularly when you're a new user or someone trying to ask a question, that's the point at which you need the most help."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And we just didn't adapt with the times."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "But the good news is they're working on this, from what I understand, and it's gonna be a more wizard based format."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you could envision a world where as part of this wizard based program, when you're asking questions, okay, come up with a good title, what are good words to put in the title?"}, {"time": 2462, "text": "One word that's not good to put in the title is problem, for example."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "I have a problem."},

help you make a good question title, for example, that step will be broken out, all that stuff."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "But one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say, hey, I'm a little nervous."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "I've never done this before."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Can you put me in a queue for special mentoring?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "You could opt in to a special

judge?"}, {"time": 2504, "text": "So that's fine."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "It's not precluded from happening."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "But there's a certain big city ethos that we started with."},

just like going about their business."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Like, look, I have things to do."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "I'm busy."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "I'm a busy professional, as are you."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "And since you're a busy professional, certainly when you ask a question, you're gonna ask the best possible question."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Because you're a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a very well written question with a lot of detail about why you're doing it, what you're doing, what you researched, what you found, because you're a professional like me."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And this rubs people sometimes the wrong way."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "And I don't think it's wrong to say, look, I don't want that experience."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "I want just a more chill place for beginners."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And I still think Stack Overflow is not, was never designed for beginners, right?"},

{"time": 2569, "text": "But for the most part, not."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "But that's not really representative, right?"}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Like, I think as a beginner, you want a totally different set of tools."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "You want like live screen sharing, live chat."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "You want access to resources."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "You want a playground, like a playground you can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just don't give people because that was never really the audience that we were designing Stack Overflow for."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "That doesn't mean it's wrong."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And I think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet, or if Stack Overflow said, hey, you know, we're gonna start doing this."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "That's fine too."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "You know, I'm not there."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "I'm not making those decisions."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "But I do think the pressure, the tension that you described is there for people to be, look, I'm a little nervous because I know I gotta do my best work, right?"}, {"time": 2606, "text": "The other one is something you talk about, which is also really interesting to me, is duplicate questions or it's a really difficult problem that you highlight."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "It's super hard."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "Like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 10, 20, 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "I don't know if there should be one page that answers all of it."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Is there a way that Stack Overflow can help disambiguate, like separate these duplicate questions or connect them together?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult, impossible task?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "I think it's a very, very hard computer science problem."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "And partly because people are very good at using completely different words."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "It always amazed me on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "You'd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Like, oh my God, from a computer science perspective, how do you even begin to solve that?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "And it happens all the time."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "People are super good at this, right?"}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Accidentally at asking the same thing in like 10, 20 different ways."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist because if there's five versions with different words, have those five versions point to the one centralized answer, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "It's like, okay, this is a duplicate, no worries."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Here's the answer that you wanted over here on the prime example that we want to have, rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "Because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer, this also devalues the reputation system, which programmers hate, as I previously mentioned."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "You're getting reputation for an answer that somebody else already gave."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "It's like, well, it's an answer, but somebody else already gave that answer."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave it four years ago?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "People get offended by that, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "And for the most part, that's good."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "I know it sounds weird, but for most parts, like look, strict systems, I think to use Stack Overflow, you have to have the idea that, OK, strict systems ultimately work better."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And I do think in programming, you're familiar with loose typing versus strict typing, right?"}, {"time": 2731, "text": "The idea that you can declare a variable, not declare a variable, rather, just start using a variable."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And OK, I see it's implicitly an integer."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Bam, awesome."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Duck equals 5."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Well, duck is now an integer of 5, right?"}, {"time": 2740, "text": "And you're like, cool, awesome, simpler, right?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Why would I want to worry about typing?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And for a long time, in the Ruby community, they're like, yeah, this is awesome."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "You just do a bunch of unit testing, which is testing your program's validity after the fact to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables would have caught."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "And now you have this thing called TypeScript for Microsoft from the guy who built C Sharp Anders, who's one of the greatest minds in software development, right, like in terms of language design."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And says, no, no, no, we want to bolt on a strict type system to JavaScript because it makes things better."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And now everybody's like, oh my god, we deployed TypeScript and found 50 latent bugs that we didn't know about, right?"}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Like, this is super common."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So I think there is a truth in programming that strictness, it's not the goal."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "We're not saying be super strict because strictness is correct."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "No, it's no, no."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Strictness produces better results."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "That's what I'm saying, right?"}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So strict typing of variables, I would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "Should be that way in every language, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Duck equals five should generate an error because no, you didn't declare."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "You didn't tell me that duck was an integer, right?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "That's a bug, right?"}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Or maybe you mistyped."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "You typed deck instead of duck, right?"}, {"time": 2806, "text": "You never know."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "This happens all the time, right?"}, {"time": 2808, "text": "So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness of the system is correct."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "Now, that doesn't mean cruel."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "That doesn't mean mean."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "That doesn't mean angry."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "It just means strict, OK?"}, {"time": 2817, "text": "So I think where there's misunderstanding is people get cranky, right?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "Like, another question you asked is like, why are programmers kind of mean sometimes?"}, {"time": 2825, "text": "Well, who do programmers work with all day long?"}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So I have a theory that if you're at a job and you work with assholes all day long, what do you eventually become?"}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "Because the computer has no time for your bullshit."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "The computer, the minute you make a mistake, everything is crashing down, right?"}, {"time": 2845, "text": "One semicolon has crashed space missions, right?"}, {"time": 2848, "text": "So that's normal."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So you begin to internalize that."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "You begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer, is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So that's kind of how I'm going to be."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "Because I work with this computer, and I have to exceed to its terms on everything."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "So therefore, you start to absorb that."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "You start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily is really good."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because that's what the computer gave me, right?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So you kind of forget to be a person at some level."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And you know how they say great detectives internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves, like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the criminal."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Well, I do think that's true of programmers."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Really good programmers think like the computer because that's their job."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "But if you internalize it too much, you become the computer."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "You kind of become a jerk to everybody because that's what you've internalized."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "You're almost not a jerk, but you have no patience for a lack of strictness, as you said."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "It's not out of a sense of meanness."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "It's accidental."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "But I do believe it's an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer."},

it."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And you don't have to store that data extra."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "This is called predictive coding."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And then there was still something wrong with that theory of the universe and you had deviations from these predictions of the theory."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "And 300 years later another guy came along whose name was Einstein."},

consequences."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "So it's a very simple thing and it allows you to further compress all the observations because certainly there are hardly any deviations any longer that you can measure from the predictions of this new theory."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So all of science is a history of compression progress."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "You never arrive immediately at the

suddenly I realize no there is a very simple way of predicting the third frame in the video from the first two."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And maybe not every little detail can be predicted but more or less most of these orange blobs that are coming down they accelerate in the same way which means that I can greatly compress the video."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And the amount of compression, progress, that is the depth of the insight that you have at that moment."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "That's the fun that you have, the scientific fun, the fun in that discovery."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And we can build artificial systems that do the same thing."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "They measure the depth of their insights as they are looking at the data which is coming in through their own experiments and we give them a reward, an intrinsic reward in proportion to this depth of insight."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And since they are trying to maximize the rewards they get they are suddenly motivated to come up with new action sequences, with new experiments that have the property that the data that is coming in as a consequence of these experiments has the property that they can learn something about, see a pattern in there which they hadn't seen yet before."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So there is an idea of power play that you described, a training in general problem solver in this kind of way of looking for the unsolved problems."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Can you describe that idea a little further?"}, {"time": 1840, "text": "It's another very simple idea."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So normally what you do in computer science, you have some guy who gives you a problem and then there is a huge search space of potential solution candidates and you somehow try them out and you have more less sophisticated ways of moving around in that search space until you finally found a solution which you consider satisfactory."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "That's what most of computer science is about."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Power play just goes one little step further and says let's not only search for solutions to a given problem but let's search to pairs of problems and their solutions where the system itself has the opportunity to phrase its own problem."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "So we are looking suddenly at pairs of problems and their solutions or modifications of the problem solver that is supposed to generate a solution to that new problem."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "And this additional degree of freedom allows us to build career systems that are like scientists in the sense that they not only try to solve and try to find answers to existing questions, no they are also free to pose their own questions."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So if you want to build an artificial scientist you have to give it that freedom and power play is exactly doing that."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So that's a dimension of freedom that's important to have but how hard do you think that, how multidimensional and difficult the space of then coming up with your own questions is."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So it's one of the things that as human beings we consider to be the thing that makes us special, the intelligence that makes us special is that brilliant insight that can create something totally new."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So now let's look at the extreme case, let's look at the set of all possible problems that you can formally describe which is infinite, which should be the next problem that a scientist or power play is going to solve."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "Well, it should be the easiest problem that goes beyond what you already know."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "So it should be the simplest problem that the current problem solver that you have which can already solve 100 problems that he cannot solve yet by just generalizing."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So it has to be new, so it has to require a modification of the problem solver such that the new problem solver can solve this new thing but the old problem solver cannot do it and in addition to that we have to make sure that the problem solver doesn't forget any of the previous solutions."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And so by definition power play is now trying always to search in this pair of, in the set of pairs of problems and problems over modifications for a combination that minimize the time to achieve these criteria."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So it's always trying to find the problem which is easiest to add to the repertoire."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "So just like grad students and academics and researchers can spend their whole career in a local minima stuck trying to come up with interesting questions but ultimately doing very little."},

discovering new, you know really jumping outside of the 100 problems that you've already solved in a genuine creative way?"}, {"time": 2087, "text": "No, because that's the nature of power play that it's always trying to break its current generalization abilities by coming up with a new problem which is beyond the current horizon."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Just shifting the horizon of knowledge a little bit out there, breaking the existing rules such that the new thing becomes solvable but wasn't solvable by the old thing."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "So in the paper with the amazing title, Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun and Intrinsic Motivation, you talk about discovery as intrinsic reward, so if you view humans as intelligent agents, what do you think is the purpose and meaning of life for us humans?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "You've talked about this discovery, do you see humans as an instance of power play, agents?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Humans are curious and that means they behave like scientists, not only the official scientists but even the babies behave like scientists and they play around with their toys to figure out how the world works and how it is responding to their actions and that's how they learn about gravity and everything."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "In 1990 we had the first systems like that which would just try to play around with the environment

more of the world."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "I think in principle that curiosity strategy or more sophisticated versions of what I just described, they are what we have built in as well because

decades and for many decades machines have found creative solutions to interesting problems where humans were not aware of these particularly creative solutions but then appreciated that the machine found that."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "The second is the pure creativity."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "That I would call, what I just mentioned, I would call the applied creativity, like applied art

Pope likes it and gives him the money."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "And then there is the pure creativity which is more like the power play and the artificial curiosity thing where you have the freedom to select your own problem."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Like a scientist who defines his own question to study and so that is the pure creativity if you will as opposed to the applied creativity which serves another."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "And in that distinction there is almost echoes of narrow AI versus general AI."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So this kind of constrained painting of a Pope

problem solving machine which is trying to solve arbitrary problems then this machine will figure out in the course of solving problems that it is good to be curious."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "So all

side effect of prediction."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "And how does this recurrent network compress?"}, {"time": 2613, "text": "Well, it's inventing little subprograms, little subnetworks that stand for everything that frequently appears in the environment like bottles and microphones and faces, maybe lots of faces in my environment so I'm learning to create something like a prototype face and a new face comes along and all I have to encode are the deviations from the prototype."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "So it's compressing all the time the stuff that frequently appears."}, {"time": 2640,

have internal self models."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "Now you can use this model of the world to plan your future and that's what we also have done since 1990."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "So the recurrent network which is the controller which is trying to maximize reward can use this model of the network of the world, this model network of the world, this predictive model of the world to plan ahead and say let's not do this action sequence, let's do this action sequence instead because it leads to more predicted reward."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And whenever it is waking up these little

you have already a problem of depth 50 because for each time step you have something like a virtual layer in the expanded unrolled version of this recurrent network which is doing the speech recognition."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "So these long time lags they translate into problem depth."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "And most problems in this world are such that you really have to look far back in time to understand what is the problem and to solve it."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "But just like with LSTMs you don't necessarily need to when you look back in time remember every aspect you just need to remember the important aspects."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "The network has to learn to put the important stuff into memory and to ignore the unimportant noise."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "But in that sense deeper and deeper is better or is there a limitation?"}, {"time": 2970, "text": "I mean LSTM is one of the great examples of architectures that do something beyond just deeper and deeper networks."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "There's clever mechanisms for filtering data, for remembering and forgetting."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So do you think that kind of thinking is necessary?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "If you think about LSTMs as a leap, a big leap forward over traditional vanilla RNNs, what do you think is the next leap within this context?"}, {"time": 3002, "text": "So LSTM is a very clever improvement but LSTM still don't have the same kind of ability to see far back in the past as us humans do."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "The credit assignment problem across way back not just 50 time steps or 100 or 1000 but millions and billions."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "It's not clear what are the practical limits of the LSTM when it comes to looking back."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Already in 2006 I think we had examples where it not only looked back tens of thousands of steps but really millions of steps."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "And Juan Perez Ortiz in my lab I think was the first author of a paper where we really, was it 2006 or something, had examples where it learned to look back for more than 10 million steps."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So for most problems of speech recognition it's not necessary to look that far back but there are examples where it does."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Now the looking back thing, that's rather easy because there is only one past but there are many possible futures and so a reinforcement learning system which is trying to maximize its future expected reward and doesn't know yet which of these many possible futures should I select given this one single past is facing problems that the LSTM by itself cannot solve."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "So the LSTM is good for coming up with a compact representation of the history and observations and actions so far but now how do you plan in an efficient and good way among all these, how do you select one of these many possible action sequences that a reinforcement learning system has to consider to maximize reward in this unknown future?"}, {"time": 3126, "text": "We have this basic setup where you have one recurrent network which gets in the video and the speech and whatever and it's executing actions and it's trying to maximize reward so there is no teacher who tells it what to do at which point in time."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "And then there's the other network which is just predicting what's going to happen if I do that and that and that could be an LSTM network and it learns to look back all the way to make better predictions of the next time step."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "So essentially although it's predicting only the next time step it is motivated to learn to put into memory something that happened maybe a million steps ago because it's important to memorize that if you want to predict that at the next time step, the next event."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Now how can a model of the world like that, a predictive model of the world be used by the first guy?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Let's call it the controller and the model, the controller and the model."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "How can the model be used by the controller to efficiently select among these many possible futures?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "The naive way we had about 30 years ago was let's just use the model of the world as a stand in, as a simulation of the world and millisecond by millisecond we plan the future and that means we have to roll it out really in detail and it will work only if the model is really good and it will still be inefficient because we have to look at all these possible futures and there are so many of them."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So instead what we do now since 2015 in our CM systems, controller model systems, we give the controller the opportunity to learn by itself how to use the potentially relevant parts of the M, of the model network to solve new problems more quickly."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "And if it wants to, it can learn to ignore the M and sometimes it's a good idea to ignore the M because it's really bad, it's a bad predictor in this particular situation of life where the controller is currently trying to maximize reward."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "However, it can also learn to address and exploit some of the subprograms that came about in the model network through compressing the data by predicting it."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So it now has an opportunity to reuse that code, the algorithmic information in the model network to reduce its own search space such that it can solve a new problem more quickly than without the model."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "Compression."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So you're ultimately optimistic and excited about the power of RL, of reinforcement learning in the context of real systems."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "So you see RL as a potential having a huge impact beyond just sort of the M part is often developed on supervised learning methods."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "You see RL as a for problems of self driving cars or any kind of applied cyber robotics."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "That's the correct interesting direction for research in your view?"}, {"time": 3334, "text": "I do think so."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "We have a company called Nasence which has applied reinforcement learning to little Audis which learn to park without a teacher."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "The same principles were used of course."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So these little Audis, they are small, maybe like that, so much smaller than the real Audis."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "But they have all the sensors that you find in the real Audis."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "You find the cameras, the LIDAR sensors."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "They go up to 120 kilometers an hour if they want to."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And they have pain sensors basically and they don't want to bump against obstacles and other Audis and so they must learn like little babies to park."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "Take the raw vision input and translate that into actions that lead to successful parking behavior which is a rewarding thing."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "And yes, they learn that."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "So we have examples like that and it's only in the beginning."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "This is just the tip of the iceberg and I believe the next wave of AI is going to be all about that."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "So at the moment, the current wave of AI is about passive pattern observation and prediction and that's what you have on your smartphone and what the major companies on the Pacific Rim are using to sell you ads to do marketing."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "That's the current sort of profit in AI and that's only one or two percent of the world economy."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Which is big enough to make these companies pretty much the most valuable companies in the world."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "But there's a much, much bigger fraction of the economy going to be affected by the next wave which is really about machines that shape the data through their own actions."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Do you think simulation is ultimately the biggest way that those methods will be successful in the next 10, 20 years?"}, {"time": 3456, "text": "We're not talking about 100 years from now."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "We're talking about sort of the near term impact of RL."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Do you think really good simulation is required or is there other techniques like imitation learning, observing other humans operating in the real world?"}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Where do you think the success will come from?"}, {"time": 3477, "text": "So at the moment, we have a tendency of using physics simulations to learn behavior from machines that learn to solve problems that humans also do not know how to solve."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "However, this is not the future because the future is in what little babies do."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "They don't use a physics engine to simulate the world."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "No, they learn a predictive model of the world which maybe sometimes is wrong in many ways but captures all kinds of important abstract high level predictions which are really important to be successful."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And that's what was the future 30 years ago when we started that type of research but it's still the future and now we know much better how to go there to move forward and to really make working systems based on that where you have a learning model of the world, a model of the world that learns to predict what's going to happen if I do that and that."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "And then the controller uses that model to more quickly learn successful action sequences."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And then of course always this curiosity thing."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "In the beginning, the model is stupid so the controller should be motivated to come up with experiments with action sequences that lead to data that improve the model."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "Do you think improving the model, constructing an understanding of the world in this connection is now the popular approaches that have been successful are grounded in ideas of neural networks."}, {"time": 3578,

right?"}, {"time": 685, "text": "So I think it's transformative and more and more and more people are more aware of it."}, {"time": 691, "text": "I mean, it's becoming quite mainstream, but back in the day, as you were saying in 2000, 2005, even it was very, still very strange thing to do, especially in Europe."}, {"time": 704, "text": "I think there were exceptions like Korea, for instance, it was amazing that everything happened so early in terms of cybercafes, like if you go to Seoul, it's a city that back in the day, StarCraft was kind of, you could be a celebrity by playing StarCraft, but this was like 99, 2000, right?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "It's not like recently."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So yeah, it's quite interesting to look back and yeah, I think it's changing society."}, {"time": 730, "text": "The same way, of course, like technology and social networks and so on are also transforming things."}, {"time": 736, "text": "And a quick tangent, let me ask, you're also one of the most productive people in your particular chosen passion and path in life."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And yet you're also appreciate and enjoy video games."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Do you think it's possible to do, to enjoy video games in moderation?"}, {"time": 755, "text": "Someone told me that you could choose two out of three."}, {"time": 759, "text": "When I was playing video games, you could choose having a girlfriend, playing video games or studying."}, {"time": 766, "text": "And I think for the most part, it was relatively true."}, {"time": 770, "text": "These things do take time."}, {"time": 772, "text": "Games like StarCraft, if you take the game pretty seriously and you wanna study it, then you obviously will dedicate more time to it."}, {"time": 779, "text": "And I definitely took gaming and obviously studying very seriously."}, {"time": 783, "text": "I love learning science and et cetera."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So to me, especially when I started university undergrad, I kind of step off StarCraft."}, {"time": 794, "text": "I actually fully stopped playing."}, {"time": 796, "text": "And then World of Warcraft was a bit more casual."}, {"time": 799, "text": "You could just connect online."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And I mean, it was fun."}, {"time": 802, "text": "But as I said, that was not as much time investment as it was for me in StarCraft."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Okay, so let's get into AlphaStar."}, {"time": 811, "text": "What are the, you're behind the team."}, {"time": 815, "text": "So DeepMind has been working on StarCraft and released a bunch of cool open source agents and so on the past few years."}, {"time": 821, "text": "But AlphaStar really is the moment where the first time you beat a world class player."}, {"time": 829, "text": "So what are the parameters of the challenge in the way that AlphaStar took it on and how did you and David and the rest of the DeepMind team get into it?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "Consider that you can even beat the best in the world or top players."}, {"time": 842, "text": "I think it all started back in 2015."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Actually, I'm lying."}, {"time": 848, "text": "I think it was 2014 when DeepMind was acquired by Google."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And I at the time was at Google Brain, which was in California, is still in California."}, {"time": 858, "text": "We had this summit where we got together, the two groups."}, {"time": 861, "text": "So Google Brain and Google DeepMind got together and we gave a series of talks."}, {"time": 866, "text": "And given that they were doing deep reinforcement learning for games, I decided to bring up part of my past, which I had developed at Berkeley, like this thing which we call Berkeley OverMind, which is really just a StarCraft one bot, right?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "So I talked about that."}, {"time": 882, "text": "And I remember Demis just came to me and said, well, maybe not now, it's perhaps a bit too early, but you should just come to DeepMind and do this again with deep reinforcement learning, right?"}, {"time": 893, "text": "And at the time it sounded very science fiction for several reasons."}, {"time": 898, "text": "But then in 2016, when I actually moved to London and joined DeepMind transferring from Brain, it became apparent that because of the AlphaGo moment and kind of Blizzard reaching out to us to say, wait, like, do you want the next challenge?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "And also me being full time at DeepMind, so sort of kind of all these came together."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And then I went to Irvine in California, to the Blizzard headquarters to just chat with them and try to explain how would it all work before you do anything."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And the approach has always been about the learning perspective, right?"}, {"time": 933, "text": "So in Berkeley, we did a lot of rule based conditioning and if you have more than three units, then go attack."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And if the other has more units than me, I retreat and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 946, "text": "And of course, the point of deep reinforcement learning, deep learning, machine learning in general is that all these should be learned behavior."}, {"time": 953, "text": "So that kind of was the DNA of the project since its inception in 2016, where we just didn't even have an environment to work with."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And so that's how it all started really."}, {"time": 965, "text": "So if you go back to that conversation with Demis or even in your own head, how far away did you, because we're talking about Atari games, we're talking about Go, which is kind of, if you're honest about it, really far away from StarCraft."}, {"time": 980, "text": "In, well, now that you've beaten it, maybe you could say it's close, but it's much, it seems like StarCraft is way harder than Go philosophically and mathematically speaking."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So how far away did you think you were?"}, {"time": 994, "text": "Do you think it's 2019 and 18 you could be doing as well as you have?"}, {"time": 997, "text": "Yeah, when I kind of thought about, okay, I'm gonna dedicate a lot of my time and focus on this."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And obviously I do a lot of different research in deep learning."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "So spending time on it, I mean, I really had to kind of think there's gonna be something good happening out of this."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So really I thought, well, this sounds impossible."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And it probably is impossible to do the full thing, like the full game where you play one versus one and it's only a neural network playing and so on."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "So it really felt like, I just didn't even think it was possible."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "But on the other hand, I could see some stepping stones towards that goal."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "Clearly you could define sub problems in StarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit and say, okay, here is a part of the game, here's another part."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And also obviously the fact, so this was really also critical to me, the fact that we could access human replays, right?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So Blizzard was very kind."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And in fact, they open source these for the whole community where you can just go and it's not every single StarCraft game ever played, but it's a lot of them you can just go and download."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And every day they will, you can just query a data set and say, well, give me all the games that were played today."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And given my kind of experience with language and sequences and supervised learning, I thought, well, that's definitely gonna be very helpful and something quite unique now, because ever before we had such a large data set of replays, of people playing the game at this scale of such a complex video game, right?"}, {"time": 1092, "text": "So that to me was a precious resource."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And as soon as I knew that Blizzard was able to kind of give this to the community, I started to feel positive about something non trivial happening."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "But I also thought the full thing, like really no rules, no single line of code that tries to say, well, I mean, if you see this unit, build a detector, all these, not having any of these specializations seemed really, really, really difficult to me."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Intuitively."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "I do also like that Blizzard was teasing or even trolling you, sort of almost, yeah, pulling you in into this really difficult challenge."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Do they have any awareness?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "What's the interest from the perspective of Blizzard, except just curiosity?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Yeah, I think Blizzard has really understood and really bring forward this competitiveness of esports in games."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "The StarCraft really kind of sparked a lot of, like something that almost was never seen, especially as I was saying, back in Korea."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "So they just probably thought, well, this is such a pure one versus one setup that it would be great to see if something that can play Atari or Go and then later on chess could even tackle these kind of complex real time strategy game, right?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So for them, they wanted to see first, obviously whether it was possible, if the game they created was in a way solvable to some extent."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And I think on the other hand, they also are a pretty modern company that innovates a lot."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So just starting to understand AI for them to how to bring AI into games is not AI for games, but games for AI, right?"}, {"time": 1194, "text": "I mean, both ways I think can work."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And we obviously at DeepMind use games for AI, right?"}, {"time": 1200, "text": "To drive AI progress, but Blizzard might actually be able to do and many other companies to start to understand and do the opposite."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So I think that is also something they can get out of these."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And they definitely, we have brainstormed a lot about these, right?"}, {"time": 1213, "text": "But one of the interesting things to me about StarCraft and Diablo and these games that Blizzard has created is the task of balancing classes, for example."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "Sort of making the game fair from the starting point and then let skill determine the outcome."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Is there, I mean, can you first comment, there's three races, Zerg, Protoss and Terran."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "I don't know if I've ever said that out loud."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Is that how you pronounce it?"}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Terran?"}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Yeah, Terran."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "Yeah, I don't think I've ever in person interacted with anybody about StarCraft, that's funny."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "So they seem to be pretty balanced."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "I wonder if the AI, the work that you're doing with AlphaStar would help balance them even further."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Is that something you think about?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "Is that something that Blizzard is thinking about?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Right, so balancing when you add a new unit or a new spell type is obviously possible given that you can always train or pre train at scale some agent that might start using that in unintended ways."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "But I think actually, if you understand how StarCraft has kind of co evolved with players, in a way, I think it's actually very cool the ways that many of the things and strategies that people came up with, right?"}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So I think we've seen it over and over in StarCraft that Blizzard comes up with maybe a new unit and then some players get creative and do something kind of unintentional or something that Blizzard designers that just simply didn't test or think about."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And then after that becomes kind of mainstream in the community, Blizzard patches the game and then they kind of maybe weaken that strategy or make it actually more interesting but a bit more balanced."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So these kind of continual talk between players and Blizzard is kind of what has defined them actually in actually most games in StarCraft but also in World of Warcraft, they would do that."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "There are several classes and it would be not good that everyone plays absolutely the same race and so on, right?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So I think they do care about balancing of course and they do a fair amount of testing but it's also beautiful to also see how players get creative anyways."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "And I mean, whether AI can be more creative at this point, I don't think so, right?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "I mean, it's just sometimes something so amazing happens."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Like I remember back in the days, like you have these drop ships that could drop the rivers and that was actually not thought about that you could drop this unit that has this what's called splash damage that would basically eliminate all the enemies workers at once."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "No one thought that you could actually put them in really early game, do that kind of damage and then things change in the game."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "But I don't know, I think it's quite an amazing exploration process from both sides, players and Blizzard alike."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Well, it's almost like a reinforcement learning exploration but the scale of humans that play Blizzard games is almost on the scale of a large scale deep mind RL experiment."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "I mean, if you look at the numbers, I mean, you're talking about, I don't know how many games but hundreds of thousands of games probably a month."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "I mean, so it's almost the same as running RL agents."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "What aspect of the problem of Starcraft do you think is the hardest?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Is it the, like you said, the imperfect information?"}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Is it the fact they have to do longterm planning?"}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Is it the real time aspects?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "We have to do stuff really quickly."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "Is it the fact that a large action space so you can do so many possible things?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Or is it, you know, in the game theoretic sense there is no Nash equilibrium or at least you don't know what the optimal strategy is because there's way too many options."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "Is there something that stands out as just like the hardest the most annoying thing?"}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So when we sort of looked at the problem and start to define like the parameters of it, right?"}, {"time": 1447, "text": "What are the observations?"}, {"time": 1448, "text": "What are the actions?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "It became very apparent that, you know, the very first barrier that one would hit in Starcraft would be because of the action space being so large and as not being able to search like you could in chess or go even though the search space is vast."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "The main problem that we identified was that of exploration, right?"}, {"time": 1472, "text": "So without any sort of human knowledge or human prior, if you think about Starcraft and you know how deep reinforcement learnings algorithm work which is essentially by issuing random actions and hoping that they will get some wins sometimes so they could learn."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "So if you think of the action space in Starcraft almost anything you can do in the early game is bad because any action involves taking workers which are mining minerals for free."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "That's something that the game does automatically sends them to mine."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And you would immediately just take them out of mining and send them around."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So just thinking how is it gonna be possible to get to understand these concepts but even more like expanding, right?"}, {"time": 1519, "text": "There's these buildings you can place in other locations in the map to gather more resources but the location of the building is important and you have to select a worker, send it walking to that location, build the building, wait for the building to be built and then put extra workers there so they start mining."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "That feels like impossible if you just randomly click to produce that state, desirable state that then you could hope to learn from because eventually that may yield to an extra win, right?"}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So for me, the exploration problem and due to the action space and the fact that there's not really turns, there's so many turns because the game essentially takes that 22 times per second."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "I mean, that's how they could discretize sort of time."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Obviously you always have to discretize time but there's no such thing as real time but it's really a lot of time steps of things that could go wrong."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And that definitely felt a priori like the hardest."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "You mentioned many good ones."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I think partial observability and the fact that there is no perfect strategy because of the partial observability."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Those are very interesting problems."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "We start seeing more and more now in terms of as we solve the previous ones but the core problem to me was exploration and solving it has been basically kind of the focus and how we saw the first breakthroughs."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So exploration in a multi hierarchical way."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "So like 22 times a second exploration has a very different meaning than it does in terms of should I gather resources early or should I wait or so on."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So how do you solve the longterm?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Let's talk about the internals of AlphaStar."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "So first of all, how do you represent the state of the game as an input?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "How do you then do the longterm sequence modeling?"}, {"time": 1628, "text": "How do you build a policy?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "What's the architecture like?"}, {"time": 1632, "text": "So AlphaStar has obviously several components but everything passes through what we call the policy which is a neural network."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And that's kind of the beauty of it."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "There is, I could just now give you a neural network and some weights."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And if you fed the right observations and you understood the actions the same way we do you would have basically the agent playing the game."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "There's absolutely nothing else needed other than those weights that were trained."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Now, the first step is observing the game and we've experimented with a few alternatives."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "The one that we currently use mixes both spatial sort of images that you would process from the game that is the zoomed out version of the map and also a zoomed in version of the camera or the screen as we call it."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "But also we give to the agent the list of units that it sees more of as a set of objects that it can operate on."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "That is not necessarily required to use it."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "And we have versions of the game that play well without this set vision that is a bit not like how humans perceive the game."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "But it certainly helps a lot because it's a very natural way to encode the game is by just looking at all the units that there are."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "They have properties like health, position, type of unit whether it's my unit or the enemies."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And that sort of is kind of the summary of the state of the game, that list of units or set of units that you see all the time."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "But that's pretty close to the way humans see the game."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "Why do you say it's not, isn't that, you're saying the exactness of it is not similar to humans?"}, {"time": 1735, "text": "The exactness of it is perhaps not the problem."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "I guess maybe the problem if you look at it from how actually humans play the game is that they play with a mouse and a keyboard and a screen and they don't see sort of a structured object with all the units."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "What they see is what they see on the screen, right?"}, {"time": 1753, "text": "Remember that there's a, sorry to interrupt, there's a plot that you showed with camera base where you do exactly that, right?"}, {"time": 1758, "text": "You move around and that seems to converge to similar performance."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "Yeah, I think that's what I, we're kind of experimenting with what's necessary or not, but using the set."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So, actually, if you look at research in computer vision, where it makes a lot of sense to treat images as two dimensional arrays, there's actually a very nice paper from Facebook."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "I think, I forgot who the authors are, but I think it's part of Caming's group."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And what they do is they take an image, which is this two dimensional signal, and they actually take pixel by pixel and scramble the image as if it was just a list of pixels."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Crucially, they encode the position of the pixels with the X, Y coordinates."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And this is just kind of a new architecture, which we incidentally also use in StarCraft called the Transformer, which is a very popular paper from last year, which yielded very nice result in machine translation."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And if you actually believe in this kind of, oh, it's actually a set of pixels, as long as you encode X, Y, it's okay, then you could argue that the list of units that we see is precisely that, because we have each unit as a kind of pixel, if you will, and then their X, Y coordinates."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So in that perspective, we, without knowing it, we use the same architecture that was shown to work very well on Pascal and ImageNet and so on."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "So the interesting thing here is putting it in that way it starts to move it towards the way you usually work with language."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So what, and especially with your expertise and work in language, it seems like there's echoes of a lot of the way you would work with natural language in the way you've approached AlphaStar."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "What's, does that help with the longterm sequence modeling there somehow?"}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Exactly, so now that we understand what an observation for a given time step is, we need to move on to say, well, there's going to be a sequence of such observations and an agent will need to, given all that it's seen, not only the current time step, but all that it's seen, why?"}, {"time": 1884, "text": "Because there is partial observability."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "We must remember whether we saw a worker going somewhere, for instance, right?"}, {"time": 1890, "text": "Because then there might be an expansion on the top right of the map."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So given that, what you must then think about is there is the problem of given all the observations, you have to predict the next action."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And not only given all the observations, but given all the observations and given all the actions you've taken, predict the next action."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And that sounds exactly like machine translation where, and that's exactly how kind of I saw the problem, especially when you are given supervised data or replays from humans, because the problem is exactly the same."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "You're translating essentially a prefix of observations and actions onto what's going to happen next, which is exactly how you would train a model to translate or to generate language as well, right?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Do you have a certain prefix?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "You must remember everything that comes in the past because otherwise you might start having noncoherent text."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And the same architectures we're using LSTMs and transformers to operate on across time to kind of integrate all that's happened in the past."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "Those architectures that work so well in translation or language modeling are exactly the same than what the agent is using to issue actions in the game."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "And the way we train it, moreover, for imitation, which is step one of AlphaStar is, take all the human experience and try to imitate it, much like you try to imitate translators that translated many pairs of sentences from French to English say, that sort of principle applies exactly the same."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "It's almost the same code, except that instead of words, you have a slightly more complicated objects, which are the observations and the actions are also a bit more complicated than a word."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "Is there a self play component then too?"}, {"time": 1993, "text": "So once you run out of imitation?"}, {"time": 1996, "text": "Right, so indeed you can bootstrap from human replays, but then the agents you get are actually not as good as the humans you imitated, right?"}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So how do we imitate?"}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Well, we take humans from 3000 MMR and higher."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "3000 MMR is just a metric of human skill and 3000 MMR might be like 50% percentile, right?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "So it's just average human."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "So maybe quick pause, MMR is a ranking scale, the matchmaking rating for players."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "So it's 3000, I remember there's like a master and a grand master, what's 3000?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "So 3000 is pretty bad."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "I think it's kind of goals level."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "It just sounds really good relative to chess, I think."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "Oh yeah, yeah, no, the ratings, the best in the world are at 7,000 MMR."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "So 3000, it's a bit like Elo indeed, right?"}, {"time": 2047, "text": "So 3,500 just allows us to not filter a lot of the data."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "So we like to have a lot of data in deep learning as you probably know."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "So we take these kind of 3,500 and above, but then we do a very interesting trick, which is we tell the neural network what level they are imitating."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "So we say, this replay you're gonna try to imitate to predict the next action for all the actions that you're gonna see is a 4,000 MMR replay."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "This one is a 6,000 MMR replay."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And what's cool about this is then we take this policy that is being trained from human, and then we can ask it to play like a 3000 MMR player by setting a beat saying, well, okay, play like a 3000 MMR player or play like a 6,000 MMR player."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "And you actually see how the policy behaves differently."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "It gets worse economy if you play like a goal level player, it does less actions per minute, which is the number of clicks or number of actions that you will issue in a whole minute."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "And it's very interesting to see that it kind of imitates the skill level quite well."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "But if we ask it to play like a 6,000 MMR player, we tested, of course, these policies to see how well they do."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "They actually beat all the built in AIs that Blizzard put in the game, but they're nowhere near 6,000 MMR players, right?"}, {"time": 2125, "text": "They might be maybe around goal level, platinum, perhaps."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "So there's still a lot of work to be done for the policy to truly understand what it means to win."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "So far, we only asked them, okay, here is the screen."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "And that's what's happened on the game until this point."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "What would the next action be if we ask a pro to now say, oh, you're gonna click here or here or there."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "And the point is experiencing wins and losses is very important to then start to refine."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Otherwise the policy can get loose, can just go off policy as we call it."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "That's so interesting that you can at least hope eventually to be able to control a policy approximately to be at some MMR level."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "That's so interesting, especially given that you have ground truth for a lot of these cases."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "Can I ask you a personal question?"}, {"time": 2177, "text": "What's your MMR?"}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Well, I haven't played StarCraft II, so I am unranked, which is the kind of lowest league."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "So I used to play StarCraft, the first one."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "But you haven't seriously played StarCraft II."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "So the best player we have at DeepMind is about 5,000 MMR, which is high masters."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "It's not at grand master level."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Grand master level will be the top 200 players in a certain region like Europe or America or Asia."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "But for me, it would be hard to say."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "I am very bad at the game."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "I actually played AlphaStar a bit too late and it beat me."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "I remember the whole team was, oh, Oreo, you should play."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "And I was, oh, it looks like it's not so good yet."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "And then I remember I kind of got busy and waited an extra week and I played and it really beat me very badly."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Was that, I mean, how did that feel?"}, {"time": 2231, "text": "Isn't that an amazing feeling?"}, {"time": 2232, "text": "That's amazing, yeah."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "I mean, obviously I tried my best and I tried to also impress my, because I actually played the first game."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "So I'm still pretty good at micromanagement."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "The problem is I just don't understand StarCraft II."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "I understand StarCraft."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "And when I played StarCraft, I probably was consistently like for a couple of years, top 32 in Europe."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So I was decent, but at the time we didn't have this kind of MMR system as well established."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "So it would be hard to know what it was back then."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "So what's the difference in interface between AlphaStar and StarCraft and a human player in StarCraft?"}, {"time": 2269, "text": "Is there any significant differences between the way they both see the game?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "I would say the way they see the game, there's a few things that are just very hard to simulate."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "The main one perhaps, which is obvious in hindsight is what's called cloaked units, which are invisible units."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "So in StarCraft, you can make some units that you need to have a particular kind of unit to detect it."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "So these units are invisible."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "If you cannot detect them, you cannot target them."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So they would just destroy your buildings or kill your workers."}, {"time": 2307, "text": "But despite the fact you cannot target the unit, there's a shimmer that as a human you observe."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "I mean, you need to train a little bit, you need to pay attention, but you would see this kind of space time distortion and you would know, okay, there are, yeah."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "Yeah, there's like a wave thing."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Yeah, it's called shimmer."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Space time distortion, I like it."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "That's really like, the Blizzard term is shimmer."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "Shimmer, okay."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so these shimmer professional players actually can see it immediately."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "They understand it very well, but it's still something that requires certain amount of attention and it's kind of a bit annoying to deal with."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "Whereas for AlphaStar, in terms of vision, it's very hard for us to simulate sort of, oh, are you looking at this pixel in the screen and so on?"}, {"time": 2354, "text": "So the only thing we can do is, there is a unit that's invisible over there."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "So AlphaStar would know that immediately."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Obviously still obeys the rules."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "You cannot attack the unit."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "You must have a detector and so on, but it's kind of one of the main things that it just doesn't feel there's a very proper way."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "I mean, you could imagine, oh, you don't have hypers."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Maybe you don't know exactly where it is, or sometimes you see it, sometimes you don't, but it's just really, really complicated to get it so that everyone would agree, oh, that's the best way to simulate this, right?"}, {"time": 2387, "text": "It seems like a perception problem."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "It is a perception problem."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "So the only problem is people, you ask, oh, what's the difference between how humans perceive the game?"}, {"time": 2396, "text": "I would say they wouldn't be able to tell a shimmer immediately as it appears on the screen, whereas AlphaStar in principle sees it very sharply, right?"}, {"time": 2405, "text": "It sees that the bit turned from zero to one, meaning there's now a unit there, although you don't know the unit, or you know that you cannot attack it and so on."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "So that from a vision standpoint, that probably is the one that is kind of the most obvious one."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "Then there are things humans cannot do perfectly, even professionals, which is they might miss a detail, or they might have not seen a unit."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And obviously as a computer, if there's a corner of the screen that turns green because a unit enters the field of view, that can go into the memory of the agent, the LSTM, and persist there for a while, and for however long is relevant, right?"}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And in terms of action, it seems like the rate of action from AlphaStar is comparative, if not slower than professional players, but it's more precise is what I read."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "So that's really probably the one that is causing us more issues for a couple of reasons, right?"}, {"time": 2465, "text": "The first one is StarCraft has been an AI environment for quite a few years."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "In fact, I mean, I was participating in the very first competition back in 2010."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And there's really not been a kind of a very clear set of rules how the actions per minute, the rate of actions that you can issue is."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And as a result, these agents or bots that people build in a kind of almost very cool way, they do like 20,000, 40,000 actions per minute."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "Now, to put this in perspective, a very good professional human might do 300 to 800 actions per minute."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "They might not be as precise."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "That's why the range is a bit tricky to identify exactly."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "I mean, 300 actions per minute precisely is probably realistic."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "800 is probably not, but you see humans doing a lot of actions because they warm up and they kind of select things and spam and so on just so that when they need, they have the accuracy."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "So we came into this by not having kind of a standard way to say, well, how do we measure whether an agent is at human level or not?"}, {"time": 2535, "text": "On the other hand, we had a huge advantage, which is because we do imitation learning, agents turned out to act like humans in terms of rate of actions, even precisions and imprecisions of actions in the supervised policy."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "You could see all these."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "You could see how agents like to spam click, to move here."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "If you played especially Diablo, you wouldn't know what I mean."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "I mean, you just like spam, oh, move here, move here, move here."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "You're doing literally like maybe five actions in two seconds, but these actions are not very meaningful."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "One would have sufficed."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "So on the one hand, we start from this imitation policy that is at the ballpark of the actions per minutes of humans because it's actually statistically trying to imitate humans."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "So we see these very nicely in the curves that we showed in the blog post."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "There's these actions per minute, and the distribution looks very human like."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "But then, of course, as self play kicks in, and that's the part we haven't talked too much yet, but of course, the agent must play against itself to improve, then there's almost no guarantees that these actions will not become more precise or even the rate of actions is going to increase over time."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "So what we did, and this is probably the first attempt that we thought was reasonable, is we looked at the distribution of actions for humans for certain windows of time."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And just to give a perspective, because I guess I mentioned that some of these agents that are programmatic, let's call them."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "They do 40,000 actions per minute."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Professionals, as I said, do 300 to 800."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "So what we looked is we look at the distribution over professional gamers, and we took reasonably high actions per minute, but we kind of identify certain cutoffs after which, even if the agent wanted to act, these actions would be dropped."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "But the problem is this cutoff is probably set a bit too high."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "And what ends up happening, even though the games, and when we ask the professionals and the gamers, by and large, they feel like it's playing humanlike, there are some agents that developed maybe slightly too high APMs, which is actions per minute, combined with the precision, which made people start discussing a very interesting issue, which is, should we have limited these?"}, {"time": 2672, "text": "Should we just let it lose and see what cool things it can come up with?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "So this is in itself an extremely interesting question, but the same way that modeling the shimmer would be so difficult, modeling absolutely all the details about muscles and precision and tiredness of humans would be quite difficult."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So we're really here kind of innovating in this sense of, OK, what could be maybe the next iteration of putting more rules that makes the agents more humanlike in terms of restrictions?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "Yeah, putting constraints that."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "More constraints, yeah."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "That's really innovative."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "So one of the constraints you put on yourself, or at least focused in, is on the Protoss race, as far as I understand."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "Can you tell me about the different races and how they, so Protoss, Terran, and Zerg, how do they compare?"}, {"time": 2727, "text": "How do they interact?"}, {"time": 2728, "text": "Why did you choose Protoss?"}, {"time": 2730, "text": "Yeah, in the dynamics of the game seen from a strategic perspective."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "So Protoss, so in StarCraft there are three races."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Indeed, in the demonstration, we saw only the Protoss race."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "So maybe let's start with that one."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "Protoss is kind of the most technologically advanced race."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "It has units that are expensive but powerful."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So in general, you want to kind of conserve your units as you go attack."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And then you want to utilize these tactical advantages of very fancy spells and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And at the same time, they're kind of, people say they're a bit easier to play perhaps."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "But that I actually didn't know."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "I mean, I just talked now a lot to the players that we work with, TLO and Mana, and they said, oh yeah, Protoss is actually, people think, is actually one of the easiest races."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "So perhaps the easier, that doesn't mean that it's obviously professional players excel at the three races."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And there's never a race that dominates for a very long time anyway."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "So if you look at the top, I don't know, 100 in the world, is there one race that dominates that list?"}, {"time": 2804, "text": "It would be hard to know because it depends on the regions."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "I think it's pretty equal in terms of distribution."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "And Blizzard wants it to be equal."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "They wouldn't want one race like Protoss to not be representative in the top place."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "So definitely, they tried it to be balanced."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So then maybe the opposite race of Protoss is Zerg."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "Zerg is a race where you just kind of expand and take over as many resources as you can, and they have a very high capacity to regenerate their units."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So if you have an army, it's not that valuable in terms of losing the whole army is not a big deal as Zerg because you can then rebuild it."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "And given that you generally accumulate a huge bank of resources, Zergs typically play by applying a lot of pressure, maybe losing their whole army, but then rebuilding it quickly."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So although, of course, every race, I mean, there's never, I mean, they're pretty diverse."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "I mean, there are some units in Zerg that are technologically advanced, and they do some very interesting spells."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And there's some units in Protoss that are less valuable, and you could lose a lot of them and rebuild them, and it wouldn't be a big deal."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "All right, so maybe I'm missing out."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Maybe I'm going to say some dumb stuff, but summary of strategy."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "So first, there's collection of a lot of resources."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "That's one option."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "The other one is expanding, so building other bases."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "Then the other is obviously building units and attacking with those units."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And then I don't know what else there is."}, {"time": 2900, "text": "Maybe there's the different timing of attacks, like do I attack early, attack late?"}, {"time": 2906, "text": "What are the different strategies that emerged that you've learned about?"}, {"time": 2909, "text": "I've read that a bunch of people are super happy that you guys have apparently, that Alpha Star apparently has discovered that it's really good to, what is it, saturate?"}, {"time": 2918, "text": "Oh yeah, the mineral line."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "Yeah, the mineral line."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And that's for greedy amateur players like myself."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "That's always been a good strategy."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "You just build up a lot of money, and it just feels good to just accumulate and accumulate."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So thank you for discovering that and validating all of us."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "But is there other strategies that you discovered that are interesting, unique to this game?"}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Yeah, so if you look at the kind of, not being a StarCraft II player, but of course StarCraft and StarCraft II and real time strategy games in general are very similar."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "I would classify perhaps the openings of the game."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "They're very important."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "And generally I would say there's two kinds of openings."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "One that's a standard opening."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "That's generally how players find sort of a balance between risk and economy and building some units early on so that they could defend, but they're not too exposed basically, but also expanding quite quickly."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "So this would be kind of a standard opening."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And within a standard opening, then what you do choose generally is what technology are you aiming towards?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So there's a bit of rock, paper, scissors of you could go for spaceships or you could go for invisible units or you could go for, I don't know, like massive units that attack against certain kinds of units, but they're weak against others."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "So standard openings themselves have some choices like rock, paper, scissors style."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Of course, if you scout and you're good at guessing what the opponent is doing, then you can play as an advantage because if you know you're gonna play rock, I mean, I'm gonna play paper obviously."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So you can imagine that normal standard games in StarCraft looks like a continuous rock, paper, scissors game where you guess what the distribution of rock, paper, and scissors is from the enemy and reacting accordingly to try to beat it or put the paper out before he kind of changes his mind from rock to scissors, and then you would be in a weak position."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "So, sorry to pause on that."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "I didn't realize this element because I know it's true with poker."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "I know I looked at Labratus."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So you're also estimating trying to guess the distribution, trying to better and better estimate the distribution of what the opponent is likely to be doing."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Yeah, I mean, as a player, you definitely wanna have a belief state over what's up on the other side of the map."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "And when your belief state becomes inaccurate, when you start having that serious doubts, whether he's gonna play something that you must know, that's when you scout."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "You wanna then gather information, right?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "Is improving the accuracy of the belief or improving the belief state part of the loss that you're trying to optimize?"}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Or is it just a side effect?"}, {"time": 3082, "text": "It's implicit, but you could explicitly model it, and it would be quite good at probably predicting what's on the other side of the map."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "But so far, it's all implicit."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "There's no additional reward for predicting the enemy."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "So there's these standard openings, and then there's what people call cheese, which is very interesting."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And AlphaStar sometimes really likes this kind of cheese."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "These cheeses, what they are is kind of an all in strategy."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "You're gonna do something sneaky."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "You're gonna hide your own buildings close to the enemy base, or you're gonna go for hiding your technological buildings so that you do invisible units and the enemy just cannot react to detect it and thus lose the game."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And there's quite a few of these cheeses and variants of them."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And there it's where actually the belief state becomes even more important."}, {"time": 3136, "text": "Because if I scout your base and I see no buildings at all, any human player knows something's up."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "They might know, well, you're hiding something close to my base."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Should I build suddenly a lot of units to defend?"}, {"time": 3148, "text": "Should I actually block my ramp with workers so that you cannot come and destroy my base?"}, {"time": 3153, "text": "So there's all this is happening and defending against cheeses is extremely important."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "And in the AlphaStar League, many agents actually develop some cheesy strategies."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And in the games we saw against TLO and Mana, two out of the 10 agents were actually doing these kind of strategies which are cheesy strategies."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And then there's a variant of cheesy strategy which is called all in."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So an all in strategy is not perhaps as drastic as, oh, I'm gonna build cannons on your base and then bring all my workers and try to just disrupt your base and game over, or GG as we say in StarCraft."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "There's these kind of very cool things that you can align precisely at a certain time mark."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "So for instance, you can generate exactly 10 unit composition that is perfect, like five of this type, five of this other type, and align the upgrade so that at four minutes and a half, let's say, you have these 10 units and the upgrade just finished."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "And at that point, that army is really scary."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "And unless the enemy really knows what's going on, if you push, you might then have an advantage because maybe the enemy is doing something more standard, it expanded too much, it developed too much economy, and it trade off badly against having defenses, and the enemy will lose."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "But it's called all in because if you don't win, then you're gonna lose."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "So you see players that do these kinds of strategies, if they don't succeed, game is not over."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "I mean, they still have a base and they still gathering minerals, but they will just GG out of the game because they know, well, game is over."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "I gambled and I failed."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "So if we start entering the game theoretic aspects of the game, it's really rich and it's really, that's why it also makes it quite entertaining to watch."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Even if I don't play, I still enjoy watching the game."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But the agents are trying to do this mostly implicitly."}, {"time": 3266, "text": "But one element that we improved in self play is creating the Alpha Star League."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And the Alpha Star League is not pure self play."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "It's trying to create a different personalities of agents so that some of them will become cheesy agents."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "Some of them might become very economical, very greedy, like getting all the resources, but then being maybe early on, they're gonna be weak, but later on, they're gonna be very strong."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "And by creating this personality of agents, which sometimes it just happens naturally that you can see kind of an evolution of agents that given the previous generation, they train against all of them and then they generate kind of the perfect counter to that distribution."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "But these agents, you must have them in the populations because if you don't have them, you're not covered against these things."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "You wanna create all sorts of the opponents that you will find in the wild."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "So you can be exposed to these cheeses, early aggression, later aggression, more expansions, dropping units in your base from the side, all these things."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "And pure self play is getting a bit stuck at finding some subset of these, but not all of these."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "So the Alpha Star League is a way to kind of do an ensemble of agents that they're all playing in a league, much like people play on Battle.net, right?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "They play, you play against someone who does a new cool strategy and you immediately, oh my God, I wanna try it, I wanna play again."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "And this to me was another critical part of the problem, which was, can we create a Battle.net for agents?"}, {"time": 3361, "text": "And that's kind of what the Alpha Star League really is."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "And where they stick to their different strategies."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Yeah, wow, that's really, really interesting."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "But that said, you were fortunate enough or just skilled enough to win five, zero."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "And so how hard is it to win?"}, {"time": 3379, "text": "I mean, that's not the goal."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "I guess, I don't know what the goal is."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "The goal should be to win majority, not five, zero, but how hard is it in general to win all matchups on a one V one?"}, {"time": 3391, "text": "So that's a very interesting question because once you see Alpha Star and superficially you think, well, okay, it won."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "Let's, if you sum all the games like 10 to one, right?"}, {"time": 3402, "text": "It lost the game that it played with the camera interface."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "You might think, well, that's done, right?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "It's superhuman at the game."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "And that's not really the claim we really can make actually."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "The claim is we beat a professional gamer for the first time."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "StarCraft has really been a thing that has been going on for a few years, but a moment like this had not occurred before yet."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "But are these agents impossible to beat?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Absolutely not, right?"}, {"time": 3433, "text": "So that's a bit what's kind of the difference is the agents play at grandmaster level."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "They definitely understand the game enough to play extremely well, but are they unbeatable?"}, {"time": 3444, "text": "Do they play perfect?"}, {"time": 3446, "text": "No, and actually in StarCraft, because of these sneaky strategies, it's always possible that you might take a huge risk sometimes, but you might get wins, right?"}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Out of this."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "So I think that as a domain, it still has a lot of opportunities, not only because of course we wanna learn with less experience, we would like to, I mean, if I learned to play Protoss, I can play Terran and learn it much quicker than Alpha Star can, right?"}, {"time": 3473, "text": "So there are obvious interesting research challenges as well, but even as the raw performance goes, really the claim here can be we are at pro level or at high grandmaster level, but obviously the players also did not know what to expect, right?"}, {"time": 3494, "text": "Their prior distribution was a bit off because they played this kind of new like alien brain as they like to say it, right?"}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And that's what makes it exciting for them."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "But also I think if you look at the games closely, you see there were weaknesses in some points, maybe Alpha Star did not scout, or if it had invisible units going against at certain points, it wouldn't have known and it would have been bad."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "So there's still quite a lot of work to do, but it's really a very exciting moment for us to be seeing, wow, a single neural net on a GPU is actually playing against these guys who are amazing."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "I mean, you have to see them play in life."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "They're really, really amazing players."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Yeah, I'm sure there must be a guy in Poland somewhere right now training his butt off to make sure that this never happens again with Alpha Star."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "So that's really exciting in terms of Alpha Star having some holes to exploit, which is great."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "And then we build on top of each other and it feels like StarCraft on let go, even if you win, it's still not, there's so many different dimensions in which you can explore."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "So that's really, really interesting."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "Do you think there's a ceiling to Alpha Star?"}, {"time": 3568, "text": "You've said that it hasn't reached, you know, this is a big, wait, let me actually just pause for a second."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "How did it feel to come here to this point, to beat a top professional player?"}, {"time": 3582, "text": "Like that night, I mean, you know, Olympic athletes have their gold medal, right?"}, {"time": 3587, "text": "This is your gold medal in a sense."}, {"time": 3588, "text": "Sure, you're cited a lot, you've published a lot of prestigious papers, whatever, but this is like a win."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "How did it feel?"}, {"time": 3596, "text": "I mean, it was, for me, it was unbelievable because first the win itself, I mean, it was so exciting."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "I mean, so looking back to those last days of 2018 really, that's when the games were played."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "I'm sure I look back at that moment, I'll say, oh my God, I want to be in a project like that."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "It's like, I already feel the nostalgia of like, yeah, that was huge in terms of the energy and the team effort that went into it."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "And so in that sense, as soon as it happened, I already knew it was kind of, I was losing it a little bit."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So it is almost like sad that it happened and oh my God, but on the other hand, it also verifies the approach."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "But to me also, there's so many challenges and interesting aspects of intelligence that even though we can train a neural network to play at the level of the best humans, there's still so many challenges."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "So for me, it's also like, well, this is really an amazing achievement, but I already was also thinking about next steps."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "I mean, as I said, these Asians play Protoss versus Protoss, but they should be able to play a different race much quicker, right?"}, {"time": 3668, "text": "So that would be an amazing achievement."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "Some people call this meta reinforcement learning, meta learning and so on, right?"}, {"time": 3675, "text": "So there's so many possibilities after that moment, but the moment itself, it really felt great."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "We had this bet, so I'm kind of a pessimist in general."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "So I kind of send an email to the team."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "I said, okay, let's against TLO first, right?"}, {"time": 3693, "text": "Like what's gonna be the result?"}, {"time": 3695, "text": "And I really thought we would lose like five zero, right?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "We had some calibration made against the 5,000 MMR player."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "TLO was much stronger than that player, even if he played Protoss, which is his off race."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "But yeah, I was not imagining we would win."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "So for me, that was just kind of a test run or something."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And then it really kind of, he was really surprised."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "And unbelievably, we went to this bar to celebrate and Dave tells me, well, why don't we invite someone who is a thousand MMR stronger in Protoss, like actual Protoss player, like that it turned up being Mana, right?"}, {"time": 3736, "text": "And we had some drinks and I said, sure, why not?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "But then I thought, well, that's really gonna be impossible to beat."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "I mean, even because it's so much ahead, a thousand MMR is really like 99% probability that Mana would beat TLO as Protoss versus Protoss, right?"}, {"time": 3753, "text": "So we did that."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "And to me, the second game was much more important, even though a lot of uncertainty kind of disappeared after we kind of beat TLO."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "I mean, he is a professional player."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "So that was kind of, oh, but that's really a very nice achievement."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "But Mana really was at the top and you could see he played much better, but our agents got much better too."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "So it's like, ah, and then after the first game, I said, if we take a single game, at least we can say we beat a game."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "I mean, even if we don't beat the series, for me, that was a huge relief."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "And I mean, I remember the hugging demis."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "And I mean, it was really like, this moment for me will resonate forever as a researcher."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And I mean, as a person, and yeah, it's a really like great accomplishment."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And it was great also to be there with the team in the room."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "I don't know if you saw like this."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "So it was really like."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "I mean, from my perspective, the other interesting thing is just like watching Kasparov, watching Mana was also interesting because he didn't, he has kind of a loss of words."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "I mean, whenever you lose, I've done a lot of sports."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "You sometimes say excuses, you look for reasons."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "And he couldn't really come up with reasons."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "I mean, so with the off race for Protoss, you could say, well, it felt awkward, it wasn't, but here it was just beaten."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "And it was beautiful to look at a human being being superseded by an AI system."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "I mean, it's a beautiful moment for researchers, so."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "Yeah, for sure it was."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "I mean, probably the highlight of my career so far because of its uniqueness and coolness."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "And I don't know, I mean, it's obviously, as you said, you can look at papers, citations and so on, but these really is like a testament of the whole machine learning approach and using games to advance technology."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "I mean, it really was, everything came together at that moment."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "That's really the summary."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "Also on the other side, it's a popularization of AI too, because it's just like traveling to the moon and so on."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "I mean, this is where a very large community of people that don't really know AI, they get to really interact with it."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Which is very important."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "I mean, we must, you know, writing papers helps our peers, researchers, to understand what we're doing."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "But I think AI is becoming mature enough that we must sort of try to explain what it is."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And perhaps through games is an obvious way because these games always had built in AI."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "So it may be everyone experience an AI playing a video game, even if they don't know, because there's always some scripted element and some people might even call that AI already, right?"}, {"time": 3913, "text": "So what are other applications of the approaches underlying AlphaStar that you see happening?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "There's a lot of echoes of, you said, transformer of language modeling and so on."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "Have you already started thinking where the breakthroughs in AlphaStar get expanded to other applications?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Right, so I thought about a few things for like kind of next month, next years."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "The main thing I'm thinking about actually is what's next as a kind of a grand challenge."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "Because for me, like we've seen Atari and then there's like the sort of three dimensional walls that we've seen also like pretty good performance from these capture the flag agents that also some people at DeepMind and elsewhere are working on."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "We've also seen some amazing results on like, for instance, Dota 2, which is also a very complicated game."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "So for me, like the main thing I'm thinking about is what's next in terms of challenge."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So as a researcher, I see sort of two tensions between research and then applications or areas or domains where you apply them."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "So on the one hand, we've done, thanks to the application of StarCraft is very hard."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "We developed some techniques, some new research that now we could look at elsewhere."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "Like are there other applications where we can apply these?"}, {"time": 3990, "text": "And the obvious ones, absolutely."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "You can think of feeding back to sort of the community we took from, which was mostly sequence modeling or natural language processing."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "So we've developed and extended things from the transformer and we use pointer networks."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "We combine LSTM and transformers in interesting ways."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "So that's perhaps the kind of lowest hanging fruit of feeding back to now a different field of machine learning that's not playing video games."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "Let me go old school and jump to Mr. Alan Turing."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "So the Turing test is a natural language test, a conversational test."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "What's your thought of it as a test for intelligence?"}, {"time": 4035, "text": "Do you think it is a grand challenge that's worthy of undertaking?"}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Maybe if it is, would you reformulate it or phrase it somehow differently?"}, {"time": 4043, "text": "Right, so I really love the Turing test because I also like sequences and language understanding."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "And in fact, some of the early work we did in machine translation, we tried to apply to kind of a neural chatbot, which obviously would never pass the Turing test because it was very limited."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "But it is a very fascinating idea that you could really have an AI that would be indistinguishable from humans in terms of asking or conversing with it."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "So I think the test itself seems very nice."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And it's kind of well defined, actually, like the passing it or not."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "I think there's quite a few rules that feel pretty simple."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "And I think they have these competitions every year."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Yes, there's the Lebner Prize."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "But I don't know if you've seen the kind of bots that emerge from that competition."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "They're not quite as what you would."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So it feels like that there's weaknesses with the way Turing formulated it."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "It needs to be that the definition of a genuine, rich, fulfilling human conversation, it needs to be something else."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "Like the Alexa Prize, which I'm not as well familiar with, has tried to define that more, I think, by saying you have to continue keeping a conversation for 30 minutes, something like that."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "So basically forcing the agent not to just fool, but to have an engaging conversation kind of thing."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "Have you thought about this problem richly?"}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And if you have in general, how far away are we from?"}, {"time": 4150, "text": "You worked a lot on language understanding, language generation, but the full dialogue, the conversation, just sitting at the bar having a couple of beers for an hour, that kind of conversation."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Have you thought about it?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "Yeah, so I think you touched here on the critical point, which is feasibility."}, {"time": 4168, "text": "So there's a great essay by Hamming, which describes sort of grand challenges of physics."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And he argues that, well, OK, for instance, teleportation or time travel are great grand challenges of physics, but there's no attacks."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "We really don't know or cannot kind of make any progress."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "So that's why most physicists and so on, they don't work on these in their PhDs and as part of their careers."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "So I see the Turing test, in the full Turing test, as a bit still too early."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "Like I think we're, especially with the current trend of deep learning language models, we've seen some amazing examples."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "I think GPT2 being the most recent one, which is very impressive."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "But to understand to fully solve passing or fooling a human to think that there's a human on the other side, I think we're quite far."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "So as a result, I don't see myself and I probably would not recommend people doing a PhD on solving the Turing test because it just feels it's kind of too early or too hard of a problem."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Yeah, but that said, you said the exact same thing about StarCraft about a few years ago."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "To Demis."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "So you'll probably also be the person who passes the Turing test in three years."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "I mean, I think that, yeah."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So we have this on record."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "This is nice."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "I mean, it's true that progress sometimes is a bit unpredictable."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "I really wouldn't have not."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Even six months ago, I would not have predicted the level that we see that these agents can deliver at grandmaster level."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "But I have worked on language enough."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "And basically, my concern is not that something could happen, a breakthrough could happen that would bring us to solving or passing the Turing test, is that I just think the statistical approach to it is not going to cut it."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "So we need a breakthrough, which is great for the community."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "But given that, I think there's quite more uncertainty."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Whereas for StarCraft, I knew what the steps would be to get us there."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "I think it was clear that using the imitation learning part and then using this battle net for agents were going to be key."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And it turned out that this was the case."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And a little more was needed, but not much more."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "For Turing test, I just don't know what the plan or execution plan would look like."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "So that's why I myself working on it as a grand challenge is hard."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "But there are quite a few sub challenges that are related that you could say, well, I mean, what if you create a great assistant like Google already has, like the Google Assistant."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "So can we make it better?"}, {"time": 4333, "text": "And can we make it fully neural and so on?"}, {"time": 4335, "text": "That I start to believe maybe we're reaching a point where we should attempt these challenges."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "I like this conversation so much because it echoes very much the StarCraft conversation."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "It's exactly how you approach StarCraft."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "Let's break it down into small pieces and solve those."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "And you end up solving the whole game."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "But that said, you're behind some of the biggest pieces of work in deep learning in the last several years."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So you mentioned some limits."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "What do you think of the current limits of deep learning?"}, {"time": 4364, "text": "And how do we overcome those limits?"}, {"time": 4367, "text": "So if I had to actually use a single word to define the main challenge in deep learning, it's a challenge that probably has been the challenge for many years."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And it's that of generalization."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So what that means is that all that we're doing is fitting functions to data."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And when the data we see is not from the same distribution, or even if there are some times that it is very close to distribution, but because of the way we train it with limited samples, we then get to this stage where we just don't see generalization as much as we can generalize."}, {"time": 4407, "text": "And I think adversarial examples are a clear example of this."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "But if you study machine learning and literature, and the reason why SVMs came very popular were because they were dealing and they had some guarantees about generalization, which is unseen data or out of distribution, or even within distribution where you take an image adding a bit of noise, these models fail."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "So I think, really, I don't see a lot of progress on generalization in the strong generalization sense of the word."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "I think our neural networks, you can always find design examples that will make their outputs arbitrary, which is not good because we humans would never be fooled by these kind of images or manipulation of the image."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "And if you look at the mathematics, you kind of understand this is a bunch of matrices multiplied together."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "There's probably numerics and instability that you can just find corner cases."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "So I think that's really the underlying topic many times we see when even at the grand stage of Turing test generalization, if you start passing the Turing test, should it be in English or should it be in any language?"}, {"time": 4488, "text": "As a human, if you ask something in a different language, you actually will go and do some research and try to translate it and so on."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "Should the Turing test include that?"}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And it's really a difficult problem and very fascinating and very mysterious, actually."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "But do you think if you were to try to solve it, can you not grow the size of data intelligently in such a way that the distribution of your training set does include the entirety of the testing set?"}, {"time": 4520, "text": "Is that one path?"}, {"time": 4521, "text": "The other path is totally a new methodology."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "It's not statistical."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So a path that has worked well, and it worked well in StarCraft and in machine translation and in languages, scaling up the data and the model."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "And that's kind of been maybe the only single formula that still delivers today in deep learning, right?"}, {"time": 4540, "text": "It's that data scale and model scale really do more and more of the things that we thought, oh, there's no way it can generalize to these, or there's no way it can generalize to that."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "But I don't think fundamentally it will be solved with this."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "And for instance, I'm really liking some style or approach that would not only have neural networks, but it would have programs or some discrete decision making, because there is where I feel there's a bit more."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "I mean, the best example, I think, for understanding this is I also worked a bit on, oh, we can learn an algorithm with a neural network, right?"}, {"time": 4578, "text": "So you give it many examples, and it's going to sort the input numbers or something like that."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "But really strong generalization is you give me some numbers or you ask me to create an algorithm that sorts numbers."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "And instead of creating a neural net, which will be fragile because it's going to go out of range at some point, you're going to give it numbers that are too large, too small, and whatnot, if you just create a piece of code that sorts the numbers, then you can prove that that will generalize to absolutely all the possible input you could give."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "So I think the problem comes with some exciting prospects."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "I mean, scale is a bit more boring, but it really works."}, {"time": 4619, "text": "And then maybe programs and discrete abstractions are a bit less developed."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "But clearly, I think they're quite exciting in terms of future for the field."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "Do you draw any insight wisdom from the 80s and expert systems and symbolic systems, symbolic computing?"}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Do you ever go back to those reasoning, that kind of logic?"}, {"time": 4640, "text": "Do you think that might make a comeback?"}, {"time": 4643, "text": "You'll have to dust off those books?"}, {"time": 4644, "text": "Yeah, I actually love actually adding more inductive biases."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "To me, the problem really is, what are you trying to solve?"}, {"time": 4654, "text": "If what you're trying to solve is so important that try to solve it no matter what, then absolutely use rules, use domain knowledge, and then use a bit of the magic of machine learning to empower to make the system as the best system that will detect cancer or detect weather patterns, right?"}, {"time": 4676, "text": "Or in terms of StarCraft, it also was a very big challenge."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "So I was definitely happy that if we had to cut a corner here and there, it could have been interesting to do."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "And in fact, in StarCraft, we start thinking about expert systems because it's a very, you know, you can define."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "I mean, people actually build StarCraft bots by thinking about those principles, like state machines and rule based."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "And then you could think of combining a bit of a rule based system, but that has also neural networks incorporated to make it generalize a bit better."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "So absolutely, I mean, we should definitely go back to those ideas."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And anything that makes the problem simpler, as long as your problem is important, that's OK. And that's research driving a very important problem."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "And on the other hand, if you want to really focus on the limits of reinforcement learning, then of course, you must try not to look at imitation data or to look for some rules of the domain that would help a lot or even feature engineering, right?"}, {"time": 4736, "text": "So this is a tension that depending on what you do, I think both ways are definitely fine."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "And I would never not do one or the other as long as what you're doing is important and needs to be solved, right?"}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Right, so there's a bunch of different ideas that you developed that I really enjoy."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "But one is translating from image captioning, translating from image to text, just another beautiful idea, I think, that resonates throughout your work, actually."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "So the underlying nature of reality being language always, somehow."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "So what's the connection between images and text, or rather the visual world and the world of language in your view?"}, {"time": 4786, "text": "Right, so I think a piece of research that's been central to, I would say, even extending into StarGraph is this idea of sequence to sequence learning, which what we really meant by that is that you can now really input anything to a neural network as the input x."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "And then the neural network will learn a function f that will take x as an input and produce any output y."}, {"time": 4812, "text": "And these x and y's don't need to be static or features, like fixed vectors or anything like that."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "It could be really sequences and now beyond data structures."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "So that paradigm was tested in a very interesting way when we moved from translating French to English to translating an image to its caption."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "But the beauty of it is that, really, and that's actually how it happened."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "I changed a line of code in this thing that was doing machine translation."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "And I came the next day, and I saw how it was producing captions that seemed like, oh my god, this is really, really working."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "And the principle is the same."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "So I think I don't see text, vision, speech, waveforms as something different as long as you basically learn a function that will vectorize these into."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "And then after we vectorize it, we can then use transformers, LSTMs, whatever the flavor of the month of the model is."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "And then as long as we have enough supervised data, really, this formula will work and will keep working, I believe, to some extent."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "Modulo these generalization issues that I mentioned before."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "But the task there is to vectorize, so to form a representation that's meaningful."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "And your intuition now, having worked with all this media, is that once you are able to form that representation, you could basically take any things, any sequence."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Going back to StarCraft, is there limits on the length so that we didn't really touch on the long term aspect?"}, {"time": 4919, "text": "How did you overcome the whole really long term aspect of things here?"}, {"time": 4923, "text": "Is there some tricks?"}, {"time": 4925, "text": "So the main trick, so StarCraft, if you look at absolutely every frame, you might think it's quite a long game."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "So we would have to multiply 22 times 60 seconds per minute times maybe at least 10 minutes per game on average."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So there are quite a few frames."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "But the trick really was to only observe, in fact, which might be seen as a limitation, but it is also a computational advantage."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "Only observe when you act."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "And then what the neural network decides is what is the gap going to be until the next action."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "And if you look at most StarCraft games that we have in the data set that Blizzard provided, it turns out that most games are actually only, I mean, it is still a long sequence, but it's maybe like 1,000 to 1,500 actions, which if you start looking at LSTMs, large LSTMs, transformers, it's not that difficult, especially if you have supervised learning."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "If you had to do it with reinforcement learning, the credit assignment problem, what is it in this game that made you win?"}, {"time": 4999, "text": "That would be really difficult."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "But thankfully, because of imitation learning, we didn't have to deal with these directly."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "Although if we had to, we tried it."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "And what happened is you just take all your workers and attack with them."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "And that is kind of obvious in retrospect because you start trying random actions."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "One of the actions will be a worker that goes to the enemy base."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "And because it's self play, it's not going to know how to defend because it basically doesn't know almost anything."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "And eventually, what you develop is this take all workers and attack because the credit assignment issue in a rally is really, really hard."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "I do believe we could do better."}, {"time": 5037, "text": "And that's maybe a research challenge for the future."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "But yeah, even in StarCraft, the sequences are maybe 1,000, which I believe is within the realm of what transformers can do."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "Yeah, I guess the difference between StarCraft and Go is in Go and Chess, stuff starts happening right away."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "So there's not, yeah, it's pretty easy to self play."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "Not easy, but to self play, it's possible to develop reasonable strategies quickly as opposed to StarCraft."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "I mean, in Go, there's only 400 actions."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "But one action is what people would call the God action."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "That would be if you had expanded the whole search tree, that's the best action if you did minimax or whatever algorithm you would do if you had the computational capacity."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "But in StarCraft, 400 is minuscule."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "Like in 400, you couldn't even click on the pixels around a unit."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "So I think the problem there is in terms of action space size is way harder."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "And that search is impossible."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "So there's quite a few challenges indeed that make this kind of a step up in terms of machine learning."}, {"time": 5110, "text": "For humans, maybe playing StarCraft seems more intuitive because it looks real."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "I mean, the graphics and everything moves smoothly, whereas I don't know how to."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "I mean, Go is a game that I would really need to study."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "It feels quite complicated."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "But for machines, kind of maybe it's the reverse, yes."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "Which shows you the gap actually between deep learning and however the heck our brains work."}, {"time": 5134, "text": "So you developed a lot of really interesting ideas."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "It's interesting to just ask, what's your process of developing new ideas?"}, {"time": 5141, "text": "Do you like brainstorming with others?"}, {"time": 5142, "text": "Do you like thinking alone?"}, {"time": 5144, "text": "Do you like, what was it, Ian Goodfellow said he came up with GANs after a few beers."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "He thinks beers are essential for coming up with new ideas."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "We had beers to decide to play another game of StarCraft after a week."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "So it's really similar to that story."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "Actually, I explained this in a DeepMind retreat."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "And I said, this is the same as the GAN story."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I mean, we were in a bar."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "And we decided, let's play a GAN next week."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "And that's what happened."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "I feel like we're giving the wrong message to young undergrads."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "Yeah, I know."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "But in general, do you like brainstorming?"}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Do you like thinking alone, working stuff out?"}, {"time": 5180, "text": "So I think throughout the years, also, things changed."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "So initially, I was very fortunate to be with great minds like Jeff Hinton, Jeff Dean, Ilya Sutskever."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "I was really fortunate to join Brain at a very good time."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "So at that point, ideas, I was just brainstorming with my colleagues and learned a lot."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And keep learning is actually something you should never stop doing."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "So learning implies reading papers and also discussing ideas with others."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "It's very hard at some point to not communicate that being reading a paper from someone or actually discussing."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "So definitely, that communication aspect needs to be there, whether it's written or oral."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "Nowadays, I'm also trying to be a bit more strategic about what research to do."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "So I was describing a little bit this tension between research for the sake of research, and then you have, on the other hand, applications that can drive the research."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "And honestly, the formula that has worked best for me is just find a hard problem and then try to see how research fits into it, how it doesn't fit into it, and then you must innovate."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "So I think machine translation drove sequence to sequence."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "Then maybe learning algorithms that had to, combinatorial algorithms led to pointer networks."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "StarCraft led to really scaling up imitation learning and the AlphaStarLeague."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "So that's been a formula that I personally like."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "But the other one is also valid."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "And I've seen it succeed a lot of the times where you just want to investigate model based RL as a research topic."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "And then you must then start to think, well, how are the tests?"}, {"time": 5292, "text": "How are you going to test these ideas?"}, {"time": 5294, "text": "You need a minimal environment to try things."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "You need to read a lot of papers and so on."}, {"time": 5299, "text": "And that's also very fun to do and something I've also done quite a few times, both at Brain, at DeepMind, and obviously as a PhD."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "So I think besides the ideas and discussions, I think it's important also because you start sort of guiding not only your own goals, but other people's goals to the next breakthrough."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "So you must really kind of understand this feasibility also, as we were discussing before, whether this domain is ready to be tackled or not."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And you don't want to be too early."}, {"time": 5335, "text": "You obviously don't want to be too late."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "So it's really interesting, this strategic component of research, which I think as a grad student, I just had no idea."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "I just read papers and discussed ideas."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "And I think this has been maybe the major change."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "And I recommend people kind of feed forward to success how it looks like and try to backtrack, other than just kind of looking, oh, this looks cool."}, {"time": 5358, "text": "This looks cool."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And then you do a bit of random work, which sometimes you stumble upon some interesting things."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "But in general, it's also good to plan a bit."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "Yeah, I like it."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "Especially like your approach of taking a really hard problem, stepping right in, and then being super skeptical about being able to solve the problem."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "I mean, there's a balance of both, right?"}, {"time": 5380, "text": "There's a silly optimism and a critical sort of skepticism that's good to balance, which is why it's good to have a team of people that balance that."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "You don't do that on your own."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "You have both mentors that have seen, or you obviously want to chat and discuss whether it's the right time."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "I mean, Demis came in 2014."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And he said, maybe in a bit we'll do StarCraft."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And maybe he knew."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "And I'm just following his lead, which is great, because he's brilliant, right?"}, {"time": 5412, "text": "So these things are obviously quite important, that you want to be surrounded by people who are diverse."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "They have their knowledge."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "There's also important to, I mean, I've learned a lot from people who actually have an idea that I might not think it's good."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "But if I give them the space to try it, I've been proven wrong many, many times as well."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "So that's great."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "I think your colleagues are more important than yourself, I think."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "Now let's real quick talk about another impossible problem, AGI."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "What do you think it takes to build a system that's human level intelligence?"}, {"time": 5454, "text": "We talked a little bit about the Turing test, StarCraft."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "All of these have echoes of general intelligence."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "But if you think about just something that you would sit back and say, wow, this is really something that resembles human level intelligence."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "What do you think it takes to build that?"}, {"time": 5469, "text": "So I find that AGI oftentimes is maybe not very well defined."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So what I'm trying to then come up with for myself is what would be a result look like that you would start to believe that you would have agents or neural nets that no longer overfeed to a single task, but actually learn the skill of learning, so to speak."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "And that actually is a field that I am fascinated by, which is the learning to learn, or meta learning, which is about no longer learning about a single domain."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you can think about the learning algorithm itself is general."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "So the same formula we applied for AlphaStar or StarCraft, we can now apply to almost any video game, or you could apply to many other problems and domains."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "But the algorithm is what's generalizing."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "But the neural network, those weights are useless even to play another race."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "I train a network to play very well at Protos versus Protos."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "I need to throw away those weights."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "If I want to play now Terran versus Terran, I would need to retrain a network from scratch with the same algorithm."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "But the network itself will not be useful."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So I think if I see an approach that can absorb or start solving new problems without the need to kind of restart the process, I think that, to me, would be a nice way to define some form of AGI."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "Again, I don't know the grandiose like age."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "I mean, should Turing tests be solved before AGI?"}, {"time": 5570, "text": "I mean, I don't know."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "I think concretely, I would like to see clearly that meta learning happen, meaning that there is an architecture or a network that as it sees new problem or new data, it solves it."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "And to make it kind of a benchmark, it should solve it at the same speed that we do solve new problems."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "When I define you a new object and you have to recognize it, when you start playing a new game, you played all the Atari games."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "But now you play a new Atari game."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "Well, you're going to be pretty quickly pretty good at the game."}, {"time": 5602, "text": "So that's perhaps what's the domain and what's the exact benchmark is a bit difficult."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "I think as a community, we might need to do some work to define it."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "But I think this first step, I could see it happen relatively soon."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "But then the whole what AGI means and so on, I am a bit more confused about what I think people mean different things."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "There's an emotional, psychological level that like even the Turing test, passing the Turing test is something that we just pass judgment on as human beings what it means to be as a dog in AGI system."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "What level, what does it mean, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 5647, "text": "But I like the generalization."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "And maybe as a community, we converge towards a group of domains that are sufficiently far away."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "That would be really damn impressive if it was able to generalize."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "So perhaps not as close as Protoss and Zerg, but like Wikipedia."}, {"time": 5662, "text": "That would be a step."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Yeah, that would be a good step and then a really good step."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "But then like from StarCraft to Wikipedia and back."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "Yeah, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "And that feels also quite hard and far."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "But I think as long as you put the benchmark out, as we discovered, for instance, with ImageNet, then tremendous progress can be had."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "So I think maybe there's a lack of benchmark, but I'm sure we'll find one and the community will then work towards that."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And then beyond what AGI might mean or would imply, I really am hopeful to see basically machine learning or AI just scaling up and helping people that might not have the resources to hire an assistant or that they might not even know what the weather is like."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "So I think in terms of the positive impact of AI, I think that's maybe what we should also not lose focus."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "The research community building AGI, I mean, that's a real nice goal."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "But I think the way that DeepMind puts it is, and then use it to solve everything else."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "So I think we should paralyze."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "Yeah, we shouldn't forget about all the positive things that are actually coming out of AI already and are going to be coming out."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "But on that note, let me ask relative to popular perception, do you have any worry about the existential threat of artificial intelligence in the near or far future that some people have?"}, {"time": 5755, "text": "I think in the near future, I'm skeptical."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "So I hope I'm not wrong."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "But I'm not concerned, but I appreciate efforts, ongoing efforts, and even like whole research field on AI safety emerging and in conferences and so on."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "I think that's great."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "In the long term, I really hope we just can simply have the benefits outweigh the potential dangers."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "I am hopeful for that."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "But also, we must remain vigilant to monitor and assess whether the tradeoffs are there and we have enough also lead time to prevent or to redirect our efforts if need be."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "But I'm quite optimistic about the technology and definitely more fearful of other threats in terms of planetary level at this point."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "But obviously, that's the one I have more power on."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "So clearly, I do start thinking more and more about this."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "And it's grown in me actually to start reading more about AI safety, which is a field that so far I have not really contributed to."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "But maybe there's something to be done there as well."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "I think it's really important."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "I talk about this with a few folks."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "But it's important to ask you and shove it in your head because you're at the leading edge of actually what people are excited about in AI."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "The work with AlphaStar, it's arguably at the very cutting edge of the kind of thing that people are afraid of."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "And so you speaking to that fact and that we're actually quite far away to the kind of thing that people might be afraid of."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "But it's still worthwhile to think about."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "And it's also good that you're not as worried and you're also open to thinking about it."}, {"time": 5865, "text": "There's two aspects."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "I mean, me not being worried."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "But obviously, we should prepare for things that could go wrong, misuse of the technologies as with any technologies."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "So I think there's always trade offs."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And as a society, we've kind of solved this to some extent in the past."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "So I'm hoping that by having the researchers and the whole community brainstorm and come up with interesting solutions to the new things that will happen in the future, that we can still also push the research to the avenue that I think is kind of the greatest avenue, which is to understand intelligence."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "How are we doing what we're doing?"}, {"time": 5909,

learning as a field heading?"}, {"time": 5922, "text": "Where do you think the next big breakthrough might be?"}, {"time": 5926, "text": "So I think deep learning, I discussed a little of this before."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "Deep learning has to be combined with some form of discretization, program synthesis."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "I think that's kind of as a research in itself is an interesting topic to expand and start doing more research."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "And then as kind of what will deep learning enable to do in the future?"}, {"time": 5948, "text": "I don't think that's going to be what's going to happen this year."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "But also this idea of starting not to throw away all the weights, that this idea of learning to learn and really having these agents not having to restart their weights."}, {"time": 5964, "text": "And you can have an agent that is kind of solving or classifying images on ImageNet, but also generating speech if you ask it to generate some speech."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "And it should really be kind of almost the same network, but it might not be a neural network."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "It might be a neural network with an optimization algorithm attached to it."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "But I think this idea of generalization to new task is something that we first must define good benchmarks."},

domain, I think we can start doing some progress."}, {"time": 6002, "text": "And much like how we did a lot of programs in computer vision, we should start thinking."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "I

you?"}, {"time": 2680, "text": "Yeah, kind of because of that adrenaline which turned into dopamine and the camaraderie."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "I mean, there's people that speak much better about this than I do."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "But I just, I'm obsessed with neurology and I'm just obsessed with sort of the lies we tell ourselves in order to justify getting neurochemicals."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "You've done actually quite, done a lot of thinking and talking about neurology and just kind of look at human behavior through the lens of looking at how our actually, chemically our brain works."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "So what, first of all, why did you connect with that idea and what have you, how has your view of the world changed by considering the brain is just a machine?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "You know, I know it probably sounds really nihilistic but for me, it's very liberating to know a lot about neurochemicals because you don't have to, it's like the same thing with like critics, like critical reviews."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "If you believe the good, you have to believe the bad kind of thing."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Like, you know, if you believe that your bad choices were because of your moral integrity or whatever, you have to believe your good ones."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "I just think there's something really liberating and going like, oh, that was just adrenaline."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "I just said that thing because I was adrenalized and I was scared and my amygdala was activated and that's why I said you're an asshole and get out."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "And that's, you know, I think, I just think it's important to delineate what's nature and what's nurture, what is your choice and what is just your brain trying to keep you safe."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "I think we forget that even though we have security systems and homes and locks on our doors, that our brain for the most part is just trying to keep us safe all the time."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "It's why we hold grudges, it's why we get angry, it's why we get road rage, it's why we do a lot of things."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "And it's also, when I started learning about neurology, I started having so much more compassion for other people."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "You know, if someone yelled at me being like, fuck you on the road, I'd be like, okay, he's producing adrenaline right now because we're all going 65 miles an hour and our brains aren't really designed for this type of stress and he's scared."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "He was scared, you know, so that really helped me to have more love for people in my everyday life instead of being in fight or flight mode."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "But the, I think more interesting answer to your question is that I've had migraines my whole life."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Like I've suffered with really intense migraines, ocular migraines, ones where my arm would go numb and I just started having to go to so many doctors to learn about it and I started, you know, learning that we don't really know that much."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "We know a lot, but it's wild to go into one of the best neurologists in the world who's like, yeah, we don't know."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And that fascinated me."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Except one of the worst pains you can probably have, all that stuff, and we don't know the source."}, {"time": 2833, "text": "We don't know the source and there is something really fascinating about when your left arm starts going numb and you start not being able to see out of the left side of both your eyes."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And I remember when the migraines get really bad, it's like a mini stroke almost and you're able to see words on a page, but I can't read them."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "They just look like symbols to me."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "So there's something just really fascinating to me about your brain just being able to stop functioning."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "And I, so I just wanted to learn about it, study about it."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "I did all these weird alternative treatments."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "I got this piercing in here that actually works."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "I've tried everything."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "And then both of my parents had strokes."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "So when both of my parents had strokes, I became sort of the person who had to decide what was gonna happen with their recovery, which is just a wild thing to have to deal with it."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "You know, 28 years old when it happened."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And I started spending basically all day, every day in ICUs with neurologists learning about what happened to my dad's brain and why he can't move his left arm, but he can move his right leg, but he can't see out of the, you know."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "And then my mom had another stroke in a different part of the brain."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "So I started having to learn what parts of the brain did what, and so that I wouldn't take their behavior so personally, and so that I would be able to manage my expectations in terms of their recovery."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "So my mom, because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe, changed a lot as a person."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "She was way more emotional."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "She was way more micromanaged."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "She was forgetting certain things."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So it broke my heart less when I was able to know, oh yeah, well, the stroke hit this part of the brain, and that's the one that's responsible for short term memory, and that's responsible for long term memory, da da da."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "And then my brother just got something called viral encephalitis, which is an infection inside the brain."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So it was kind of wild that I was able to go, oh, I know exactly what's happening here, and I know, you know, so."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So that's allows you to have some more compassion for the struggles that people have, but does it take away some of the magic for some of the, from the, some of the more positive experiences of life?"}, {"time": 2951, "text": "Sometimes, and I don't, I'm such a control addict that, you know, I think our biggest, someone like me, my biggest dream is to know why someone's doing it."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "That's what standup is."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "It's just trying to figure out why, or that's what writing is."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "That's what acting is."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "That's what performing is."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "It's trying to figure out why someone would do something."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "As an actor, you get a piece of, you know, material, and you go, this person, why would he say that?"}, {"time": 2972, "text": "Why would he, she pick up that cup?"}, {"time": 2973, "text": "Why would she walk over here?"}, {"time": 2975, "text": "It's really why, why, why, why."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "So I think neurology is, if you're trying to figure out human motives and why people do what they do, it'd be crazy not to understand how neurochemicals motivate us."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "I also have a lot of addiction in my family and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "And in order to cope with it, you really have to understand that borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So I have a lot of people I love that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "And the first thing they started teaching you is it's not a choice."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "These people's dopamine receptors don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know, and that really helped me to navigate dealing, loving people that were addicted to substances."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "I want to be careful with this question, but how much?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Money do you have?"}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Can I borrow $10?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Okay, no, is how much control, how much, despite the chemical imbalances or the biological limitations that each of our individual brains have, how much mind over matter is there?"}, {"time": 3047, "text": "So through things that I've known people with clinical depression, and so it's always a touchy subject to say how much they can really help it."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "What can you, yeah, what can you, because you've talked about codependency, you talked about issues that you struggle through, and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey of healing and so on, so that's your choice, that's your actions."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So how much can you do to help fight the limitations of the neurochemicals in your brain?"}, {"time": 3080, "text": "That's such an interesting question, and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer, but I'll say what I do know."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "And really quick, just the definition of codependency, I think a lot of people think of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off, but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "You grow up in an alcoholic home, you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos, you have a parent that's a narcissist, you basically are wired to just people please, worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells, shape shift to accommodate other people."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "So codependence is a very active wiring issue that, you know, doesn't just affect your romantic relationships, it affects you being a boss, it affects you in the world."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "Online, you know, you get one negative comment and it throws you for two weeks."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "You know, it also is linked to eating disorders and other kinds of addiction."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "So it's a very big thing, and I think a lot of people sometimes only think that it's in a romantic relationship, so I always feel the need to say that."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "And also one of the reasons I love the idea of robots so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells around them, you don't have to worry they're gonna get mad at you yet, but there's no, codependents are hypersensitive to the needs and moods of others, and it's very exhausting, it's depleting."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "Just one conversation about where we're gonna go to dinner is like, do you wanna go get Chinese food?"}, {"time": 3167, "text": "We just had Chinese food."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Well, wait, are you mad?"}, {"time": 3170, "text": "Well, no, I didn't mean to, and it's just like that codependents live in this, everything means something, and humans can be very emotionally exhausting."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Why did you look at me that way?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "What are you thinking about?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "What was that?"}, {"time": 3182, "text": "Why'd you check your phone?"}, {"time": 3183, "text": "It's a hypersensitivity that can be incredibly time consuming, which is why I love the idea of robots just subbing in."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "Even, I've had a hard time running TV shows and stuff because even asking someone to do something, I don't wanna come off like a bitch, I'm very concerned about what other people think of me, how I'm perceived, which is why I think robots will be very beneficial for codependents."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "By the way, just a real quick tangent, that skill or flaw, whatever you wanna call it, is actually really useful for if you ever do start your own podcast for interviewing, because you're now kind of obsessed about the mindset of others, and it makes you a good sort of listener and talker with."},

don't feel like she has that at all."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "She worries about other people's feelings?"}, {"time": 3237, "text": "Oh, I don't get that at all."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "I mean, you have to put yourself in the mind of the person you're speaking with."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "Oh, I see, just in terms of, yeah, I am starting a podcast, and the reason I haven't is because I'm codependent and I'm too worried it's not gonna be perfect."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So a big codependent adage is perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis."}, {"time": 3256,

media, is the exception active?"}, {"time": 3265, "text": "But by the way, I took you on a tangent and didn't answer your last question about how much we can control."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "How much, yeah, we'll return it, or maybe not."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "The answer is we can't."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Now as a codependent, I'm, okay, good."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "We can, but, but, you know, one of the things that I'm fascinated by is, you know, the first thing you learn when you go into 12 step programs or addiction recovery or any of this is, you know, genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And there's certain parts of your genetics you cannot control."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "I come from a lot of alcoholism."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "I come from, you know, a lot of mental illness."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "There's certain things I cannot control and a lot of things that maybe we don't even know yet what we can and can't because of how little we actually know about the brain."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "But we also talk about the warrior spirit."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "And there are some people that have that warrior spirit and we don't necessarily know what that engine is, whether it's you get dopamine from succeeding or achieving or martyring yourself or the attention you get from growing."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "So a lot of people are like, oh, this person can edify themselves and overcome, but if you're getting attention from improving yourself, you're gonna keep wanting to do that."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "So that is something that helps a lot of, in terms of changing your brain."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "If you talk about changing your brain to people and talk about what you're doing to overcome set obstacles, you're gonna get more attention from them, which is gonna fire off your reward system and then you're gonna keep doing it."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "Yeah, so you can leverage that momentum."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So this is why in any 12 step program, you go into a room and you talk about your progress because then everyone claps for you."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "And then you're more motivated to keep going."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "So that's why we say you're only as sick as the secrets you keep, because if you keep things secret, there's no one guiding you to go in a certain direction."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "It's based on, right?"}, {"time": 3367, "text": "We're sort of designed to get approval from the tribe or from a group of people because our brain translates it to safety."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "So, you know."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And in that case, the tribe is a positive one that helps you go in a positive direction."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "So that's why it's so important to go into a room and also say, hey, I wanted to use drugs today."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "And people go, hmm."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "They go, me too."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And you feel less alone and you feel less like you're, you know, have been castigated from the pack or whatever."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "And then you say, and you get a chip when you haven't drank for 30 days or 60 days or whatever."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "You get little rewards."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "So talking about a pack that's not at all healthy or good, but in fact is often toxic, social media."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "So you're one of my favorite people on Twitter and Instagram to sort of just both the comedy and the insight and just fun."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "How do you prevent social media from destroying your mental health?"}, {"time": 3420, "text": "It's the next big epidemic, isn't it?"}, {"time": 3425,

mean, I guess, again, it depends on your goals, you know?"}, {"time": 3437, "text": "And I think for me, the way that my addiction to social media, I'm happy to call it an addiction."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "I mean, and I define it as an addiction because it stops being a choice."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "There are times I just reach over and I'm like, that was."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "Yeah, that was weird."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "That was weird."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "I'll be driving sometimes and I'll be like, oh my God, my arm just went to my phone, you know?"}, {"time": 3456,

there's a way to, but I think I'm especially a weirdo in this space because it's easy to conflate."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Is this work?"}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Is this not?"}, {"time": 3478,

really big break."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "I took like six months off or something for a while because it was just like, it seemed like it was all kind of politics and it was just a little bit, it wasn't giving me dopamine because there was like this weird, a lot of feedback."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "So I had to take a break from it and then go back to it because I felt like I didn't have a

all these people that have so much more money than me and so much more success than me."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "It's making me feel like a failure, even though I don't think I'm a failure, but it's

now and it's, I'm curious to see where it evolves."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "I think you're at the center of that."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "So like, you know, there's, you know, trying to leave

being, you know, I have a couple answers."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "I think, you know, I hire a company to do some of my social media for me, you know?"}, {"time": 3753, "text": "So it's also being

not 24 seven in the weeds hashtagging and responding."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "And just, it's a lot to take on."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "It's a lot of energy to take on."}, {"time": 3768, "text":

tried so many things and it just didn't work."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "In the end, what we did, and Adam Coles was crucial to this, was put cameras on the ground and use cameras on the ground to localize the helicopter."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "And that solved the localization problem so that we could then focus on the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques so it didn't actually make the helicopter fly."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I'm reminded, when I was doing this work at Stanford, around that time, there was a lot of reinforcement learning theoretical papers, but not a lot of practical applications."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So the autonomous helicopter work for flying helicopters was one of the few practical applications of reinforcement learning

the importance of, the early importance of unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So early days of Google Brain, we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And there was this argument, I think it was around 2005 after NeurIPS, at that time called NIPS, but now NeurIPS had ended."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And Jeff

years."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "You actually live for two by 10 to the nine, maybe three by 10 to the nine seconds."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So just let's say 10 to the nine."}, {"time": 1466,

10 to the five bits per second you need to learn in your life."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And I have a one year old daughter."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "I am not pointing out 10 to five bits per second of labels to her."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And I think I'm a very loving parent, but I'm just not gonna do that."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "So from this very crude, definitely problematic argument, there's just no way that most of what we know is through supervised learning."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "But where you get so many bits of information is from sucking in images, audio, those experiences in the world."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And so that argument, and there are a lot of known forces argument you should go into, really convinced me that there's a lot of power to unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "So that was the part that we actually maybe got wrong."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I still think unsupervised learning is really important, but in the early days, 10, 15 years ago, a lot of us thought that was the path forward."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Oh, so you're saying that that perhaps was the wrong intuition for the time."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "For the time, that was the part we got wrong."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "The part we got right was the importance of scale."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So Adam Coates, another wonderful person, fortunate to have worked with him, he was in my group at Stanford at the time and Adam had run these experiments at Stanford showing that the bigger we train a learning algorithm, the better its performance."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And it was based on that."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "There was a graph that Adam generated where the X axis, Y axis lines going up into the right."},

that he gave me the conviction that you could scale these models way bigger than what we could on a few CPUs, which is where we had at Stanford that we could get even better results."}, {"time": 1591,

want to go for scale?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "Like this is a bad career move."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So my well meaning friends, some of them were trying to talk me out of it."}, {"time": 1653,

very carefully selecting the data set, but growing the scale of the data set is going to lead to even further breakthroughs in deep learning."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And there's currently pushback at that idea that larger data sets are no longer, so you want to increase the efficiency of learning."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "You want to make better learning mechanisms."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And I personally believe that bigger data sets will still, with the same learning methods we have now, will result in better performance."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "What's your intuition at this time on this dual side?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Do we need to come up with better architectures for learning or can we just get bigger, better data sets that will improve performance?"}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I think both are important and it's also problem dependent."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So for a few data sets, we may be approaching a Bayes error rate or approaching or surpassing human level performance and then there's that theoretical ceiling that we will never surpass, so Bayes error rate."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "But then I think there are plenty of problems where we're still quite far from either human level performance or from Bayes error rate and bigger data sets with neural networks without further algorithmic innovation will be sufficient to take us further."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "But on the flip side, if we look at the recent breakthroughs using transforming networks or language models, it was a combination of novel architecture but also scale had a lot to do with it."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "If we look at what happened with GP2 and BERTZ, I think scale was a large part of the story."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Yeah, that's not often talked about is the scale of the data set it was trained on and the quality of the data set because there's some, so it was like reddit threads that had, they were operated highly."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So there's already some weak supervision on a very large data set that people don't often talk about, right?"}, {"time": 1787, "text": "I find that today we have maturing processes to managing code,

to be had still."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "I love the idea that you were versioning through email."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "I'll give you one example."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "When we work with

else's nicely clean data set."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "It's actually much harder if you need to go and define your own problem and find your own data set, rather than you go to one of the several

2073, "text": "Yeah, so how does one get started in deep learning and where does deeplearning.ai fit into that?"}, {"time": 2080, "text": "So the deep learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai is I think it was Coursera's top specialization."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "It might still be."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "So it's a very popular way for people to take that specialization to learn about everything from neural networks to how to tune in your network to what is a ConvNet to what is a RNN or a sequence model or what is an attention model."}, {"time": 2105,

background?"}, {"time": 2125, "text": "Yeah, need to understand basic programming since there are programming exercises in Python and the math prereq is quite basic."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "So no calculus is needed."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "If you know calculus is great, you get better intuitions but deliberately try to teach that specialization without requiring calculus."}, {"time": 2142,

activation functions."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "You learn how to train the neural networks."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "One thing I'm very proud of in that specialization is we go through a lot of practical knowhow of how to actually make these things work."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "So what are the differences between different optimization algorithms?"}, {"time": 2215, "text": "What do you do if the algorithm overfits or how do you tell if the algorithm is overfitting?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "When do you collect more data?"}, {"time": 2220, "text": "When should you not bother to collect more data?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "I find that even today, unfortunately, there are engineers that will spend six months trying to pursue a particular direction such as collect more data because we

function column?"}, {"time": 2311, "text": "When should you not?"}, {"time": 2312, "text": "How do you think about abstraction?"}, {"time": 2314, "text": "So those frameworks are what makes a

at debugging machine learning algorithms are easily 10x, maybe 100x faster at getting something to work."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "And the basic process of debugging is, so the bug in this case, why

you know, you take these fractals or you take whatever your data set, whatever you have, say a picture of Convey's Game of Life and you run through all programs."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "It may be a long program because it's faster and then you continue and you get shorter and shorter programs until you eventually find the shortest program."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "The interesting thing, you

missing."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But if you think it through, then you realize that most, and I claim all of the other traits, at least of rational intelligence, which we usually associate with

1664, "text": "Did you mention the word goals?"}, {"time": 1665, "text": "No, but we have an alternative definition."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "Instead of performing well, you can just replace it by goals."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "That's more or less equal."}, {"time": 1676,

perform well is sort of, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "There's a little bit gray area, but it's much closer to something that could be formalized."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "In your view, are humans, where do humans fit into that definition?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Are they general intelligence systems that are able to perform in, like how good are they at fulfilling that

probably outlast us."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Yeah, but they are in a much more narrow environment, right?"}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I mean, you just have a little bit of air pollutions and these trees die and we can adapt, right?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "We build houses, we build filters, we do geoengineering."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So the multiple environment part."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Yeah, that is very important, yeah."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So that distinguish narrow intelligence from wide intelligence, also in the AI research."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So let me ask the Allentourian question."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Can machines be intelligent?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So in your view, I have to kind of ask, the answer is probably yes, but I want to kind

yes, I believe that general intelligence is possible."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And it also, I mean, it depends how you define it."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Do you say AGI with general intelligence, artificial intelligence, only refers to if you achieve human level or a subhuman level, but quite broad, is it also general intelligence?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "So we have to distinguish, or it's only super human intelligence, general artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Is there a test in your mind, like the Turing test for natural language or some other test that would impress

I think it's not as bad as some people think."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And some people think it's too strong."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So it tests not just for system to be intelligent, but it also has to fake human deception, which is much harder."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And on the other hand, they say it's too weak because it just maybe fakes emotions or intelligent behavior."},

couple of weeks ago, I think."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "Yeah, I kind of like the metric that sort of the Alexa Prize has proposed."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "I mean, maybe it's obvious to you."},

We don't have to put them now."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Scratch it, scratch it, dumb question, okay."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "So the simplest form of prediction is that you just have data which you passively observe, and you want to predict what happens without interfering, as I said, weather forecasting, stock market, IQ sequences, or just anything, okay?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "Of course, if there's a prediction task, or a task which is unpredictable, like, you know, you have fair coin flips."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Yeah, I cannot predict the next fair coin flip."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "What Solomonov does is says, okay, next head is probably 50%."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "It's the best you can do."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "So if something is unpredictable, Solomonov will also not magically predict it."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "But if there is some pattern and predictability, then Solomonov induction will figure that out eventually, and not just eventually, but rather quickly, and you can have proof convergence rates, whatever your data is."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So there's pure magic in a sense."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "What's the catch?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "Well, the catch is that it's not computable, and we come back to that later."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "You cannot just implement it even with Google resources here, and run it and predict the stock market and become rich."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "I mean, Ray Solomonov already tried it at the time."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "But so the basic task is you're in the environment,

simple."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "Yeah, so let's go to the actions now."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "But actually, good that you asked."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "Usually I skip this part, although there is also a minor contribution which I did, so the action part, but I usually sort of just jump to the decision part."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "So let me explain the action part now."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "Thanks for asking."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So you have to modify it a little bit by now not just predicting a sequence which just comes to you, but you have an observation, then you act somehow, and then you want to predict the next observation based on the past observation and your action."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Then you take the next action."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "You don't care about predicting it because you're doing it."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Then you get the next observation, and you want, well, before you get it, you want to predict it, again, based on

here, but you're looking at the, in terms of observations, you're looking at the entire, the big history, the long history of the observations."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "That's very important."},

you know, in RL, you have MDPs, micro decision processes, which are much more limiting."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "So now we can predict conditioned on actions."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So even if you influence environment, but prediction is not all we want to do, right?"}, {"time": 2604, "text": "We also want to act really in the world."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And the question is how to choose the actions."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And we don't want to greedily choose the actions, you know, just, you know, what is best in the next time step."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And we first,

a very scarce, right?"}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Like if you play chess, just at the end of the game, you give plus one for winning or minus one for losing."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "So in the RxC framework, that's completely sufficient."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "So occasionally you give a reward signal and you ask the agent to maximize reward, but not greedily sort of, you know, the next one,

play again, the best move."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And then you have this expecting max three to the end of the game, and then you back propagate, and then you get the best possible move."},

usually, I mean, the dead nature is stochastic, you know, things just happen randomly, or don't care about you."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "So what you have to take into account is the noise, and not necessarily adversarialty."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "So you replace the minimum on the opponent's side by an expectation, which is general enough to include also adversarial cases."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "So now instead of a mini max strategy, you have an expected max strategy."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "So far, so good."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "So that is well known."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "It's called sequential decision theory."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "But the question is, on which probability distribution do you base that?"}, {"time": 2752, "text": "If I have the true

probabilities and feed it in the expected max, or the sequential decision tree, come up with the optimal decision if I have enough compute."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "But for the real world, we don't know that, you know, what is the probability the driver in front of me breaks?"}, {"time": 2774, "text": "So depends on all kinds of things, and especially new situations, I don't know."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "So this is this unknown thing about prediction, and there's where Solomonov comes in."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So what you do is in sequential decision tree, you just replace the true

here?"}, {"time": 2819, "text": "I'm trying to understand."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "So what it does it, so in the simplest case, I said, take the shortest program, describing your data, run it, have a prediction which would be deterministic."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "But you should not just take the shortest program, but also consider the longer ones, but give it lower a priori probability."},

wrong model, it's very unlikely that this model is true."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And so it is very small number."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So even if the model is simple, it gets penalized by that."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And what you do is then you take just the sum, or this is the average over it."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "And this gives you a probability distribution."}, {"time":

kind of a nice idea."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "So okay, and then you said there's you're playing N or M or forgot the letter steps into the future."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So how difficult is that problem?"}, {"time": 2908, "text": "What's involved there?"}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Okay, so basic optimization problem."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "What are we talking about?"}, {"time": 2912,

instance, you think, no, let's let the parameter M tend to infinity, right?"}, {"time": 2952, "text": "You want an agent which lives forever, right?"}, {"time": 2955, "text": "If you do it normally, you have two problems."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "First, the mathematics breaks down because you have an infinite reward sum, which may give infinity, and getting reward 0.1 every time step is infinity, and giving reward one every time step is infinity, so equally good."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "Not really what we want."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "Other problem is that if you have an infinite life, you can be lazy for as long as you want for 10 years and then catch up with the same expected reward."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And think about yourself or maybe some friends or so."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "If they knew they lived forever, why work hard now?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Just enjoy your life and then catch up later."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "So that's another problem with infinite horizon."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And you mentioned, yes, we can go to discounting, but then the standard discounting is so called geometric discounting."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "So a dollar today is about worth as much as $1.05 tomorrow."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So if you do the so called geometric discounting, you have introduced an effective horizon."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So the agent is now motivated to look ahead a certain amount of time effectively."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "It's like a moving horizon."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "And for any fixed effective horizon, there is a problem to solve, which requires larger horizon."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So if I look ahead five time steps, I'm a terrible chess player, right?"}, {"time": 3032, "text": "I'll need to look ahead longer."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "If I play go, I probably have to look ahead even longer."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So for every problem, for every horizon, there is a problem which this horizon cannot solve."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "But I introduced the so called near harmonic horizon, which goes down with one over T rather than exponential in T, which produces an agent, which effectively looks into the future proportional to each age."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "So if it's five years old, it plans for five years."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "If it's 100 years old, it then plans for 100 years."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And it's a little bit similar to humans too, right?"}, {"time": 3062, "text": "I mean, children don't plan ahead very long, but then we get adult, we play ahead more longer."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Maybe when we get very old, I mean, we know that we don't live forever."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "Maybe then our horizon shrinks again."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So adjusting the horizon, is there some mathematical benefit of that?"}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Or is it just a nice, I mean, intuitively, empirically, it would probably be a good idea to sort of push the horizon back, extend the horizon as you experience more of the world."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "But is there some mathematical conclusions here that are beneficial?"}, {"time": 3097, "text": "With solomonic reductions or the prediction part, we have extremely strong finite time, but not finite data results."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "So you have so and so much data, then you lose so and so much."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So it's a, the theory is really great."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "With the ICSE model, with the planning part, many results are only asymptotic, which, well, this is... What does asymptotic mean?"}, {"time": 3117, "text": "Asymptotic means you can prove, for instance, that in the long run, if the agent, you know, acts long enough, then, you know, it performs optimal or some nice thing happens."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "So, but you don't know how fast it converges."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "So it may converge fast, but we're just not able to prove it because of a difficult problem."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Or maybe there's a bug in the model so that it's really that slow."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So that is what asymptotic means, sort of eventually, but we don't know how fast."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And if I give the agent a fixed horizon M, then I cannot prove asymptotic results, right?"}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So I mean, sort of if it dies in a hundred years, then in a hundred years it's over, I cannot say eventually."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "So this is the advantage of the discounting that I can prove asymptotic results."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So just to clarify, so I, okay, I made, I've built up a model, we're now in the moment of, I have this way of looking several steps ahead."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "How do I pick what action I will take?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "It's like with the playing chess, right?"}, {"time": 3180, "text": "You do this minimax."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "In this case here, do expectimax based on the solomonov distribution, you propagate back, and then while an action falls out, the action which maximizes the future expected reward on the solomonov distribution, and then you just take this action."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And then repeat."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "And then you get a new observation, and you feed it in this action observation, then you repeat."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "And the reward, so on."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Yeah, so you rewrote too, yeah."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "And then maybe you can even predict your own action."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "I love that idea."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "But okay, this big framework, what is it, I mean, it's kind of a beautiful mathematical framework to think about artificial general intelligence."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "What can you, what does it help you into it about how to build such systems?"}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Or maybe from another perspective, what does it help us in understanding AGI?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "So when I started in the field, I was always interested in two things."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "One was AGI, the name didn't exist then, what's called general AI or strong AI, and the physics theory of everything."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So I switched back and forth between computer science and physics quite often."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "You said the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "The theory of everything, yeah."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Those are basically the two biggest problems before all of humanity."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Yeah, I can explain if you wanted some later time, why I'm interested in these two questions."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "Can I ask you in a small tangent, if it was one to be solved, which one would you, if an apple fell on your head and there was a brilliant insight and you could arrive at the solution to one, would it be AGI or the theory of everything?"}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Definitely AGI, because once the AGI problem is solved, I can ask the AGI to solve the other problem for me."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "Yeah, brilliant input."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Okay, so as you were saying about it."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Okay, so, and the reason why I didn't settle, I mean, this thought about, once you have solved AGI, it solves all kinds of other, not just the theory of every problem, but all kinds of more useful problems to humanity is very appealing to many people."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "And I had this thought also, but I was quite disappointed with the state of the art of the field of AI."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "There was some theory about logical reasoning, but I was never convinced that this will fly."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "And then there was this more heuristic approaches with neural networks and I didn't like these heuristics."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So, and also I didn't have any good idea myself."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "So that's the reason why I toggled back and forth quite some while and even worked four and a half years in a company developing software, something completely unrelated."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "But then I had this idea about the ICSE model."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And so what it gives you, it gives you a gold standard."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "So I have proven that this is the most intelligent agents which anybody could build in quotation mark, because it's just mathematical and you need infinite compute."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "But this is the limit and this is completely specified."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "It's not just a framework and every year, tens of frameworks are developed, which are just skeletons and then pieces are missing."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And usually these missing pieces, turn out to be really, really difficult."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And so this is completely and uniquely defined and we can analyze that mathematically."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "And we've also developed some approximations."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I can talk about that a little bit later."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "That would be sort of the top down approach, like say for Neumann's minimax theory, that's the theoretical optimal play of games."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And now we need to approximate it, put heuristics in, prune the tree, blah, blah, blah, and so on."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "So we can do that also with the ICSE model, but for general AI."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "It can also inspire those, and most researchers go bottom up, right?"}, {"time": 3420, "text": "They have the systems, they try to make it more general, more intelligent."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "It can inspire in which direction to go."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "So if you have some choice to make, right?"}, {"time": 3431, "text": "So how should I evaluate my system if I can't do cross validation?"}, {"time": 3435, "text": "How should I do my learning if my standard regularization doesn't work well?"}, {"time": 3441, "text": "So the answer is always this, we have a system which does everything, that's ICSE."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "It's just completely in the ivory tower, completely useless from a practical point of view."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "But you can look at it and see, ah, yeah, maybe I can take some aspects."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "And instead of Kolmogorov complexity, that just takes some compressors, which has been developed so far."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And for the planning, well, we have UCT, which has also been used in Go."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And at least it's inspired me a lot to have this formal definition."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "And if you look at other fields, like I always come back to physics because I have a physics background, think about the phenomenon of energy."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "That was long time a mysterious concept."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "And at some point it was completely formalized."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "And that really helped a lot."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "And you can point out a lot of these things which were first mysterious and vague, and then they have been rigorously formalized."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Speed and acceleration has been confused, right?"}, {"time": 3498, "text": "Until it was formally defined, yeah, there was a time like this."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And people often who don't have any background, still confuse it."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And this ICSE model or the intelligence definitions, which is sort of the dual to it, we come back to that later, formalizes the notion of intelligence uniquely and rigorously."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "So in a sense, it serves as kind of the light at the end of the tunnel."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So for, I mean, there's a million questions I could ask her."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "So maybe kind of, okay, let's feel around in the dark a little bit."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "So there's been here a deep mind, but in general, been a lot of breakthrough ideas, just like we've been saying around reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "So how do you see the progress in reinforcement learning is different?"}, {"time": 3544, "text": "Like which subset of ICSE does it occupy?"}, {"time": 3548, "text": "The current, like you said, maybe the Markov assumption is made quite often in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "There's other assumptions made in order to make the system work."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "What do you see as the difference connection between reinforcement learning and ICSE?"}, {"time": 3566, "text": "And so the major difference is that essentially all other approaches, they make stronger assumptions."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "So in reinforcement learning, the Markov assumption is that the next state or next observation only depends on the previous observation and not the whole history, which makes, of course, the mathematics much easier rather than dealing with histories."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Of course, they profit from it also, because then you have algorithms that run on current computers and do something practically useful."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "But for general AI, all the assumptions which are made by other approaches, we know already now they are limiting."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "So, for instance, usually you need a goddessity assumption in the MDP frameworks in order to learn."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "A goddessity essentially means that you can recover from your mistakes and that there are no traps in the environment."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "And if you make this assumption, then essentially you can go back to a previous state, go there a couple of times and then learn what statistics and what the state is like, and then in the long run perform well in this state."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "But there are no fundamental problems."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "But in real life, we know there can be one single action."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "One second of being inattentive while driving a car fast can ruin the rest of my life."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "I can become quadriplegic or whatever."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "So, and there's no recovery anymore."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "So, the real world is not ergodic, I always say."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "There are traps and there are situations where you are not recover from."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "And very little theory has been developed for this case."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "What about, what do you see in the context of IECSIA as the role of exploration?"}, {"time": 3667, "text": "Sort of, you mentioned in the real world you can get into trouble when we make the wrong decisions and really pay for it."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "But exploration seems to be fundamentally important for learning about this world, for gaining new knowledge."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So, is exploration baked in?"}, {"time": 3687, "text": "Another way to ask it, what are the potential to ask it, what are the parameters of IECSIA that can be controlled?"}, {"time": 3696, "text": "Yeah, I say the good thing is that there are no parameters to control."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "Some other people track knobs to control."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "And you can do that."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "I mean, you can modify IECSIA so that you have some knobs to play with if you want to."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "But the exploration is directly baked in."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And that comes from the Bayesian learning and the longterm planning."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "So these together already imply exploration."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "You can nicely and explicitly prove that for simple problems like so called bandit problems, where you say, to give a real world example, say you have two medical treatments, A and B, you don't know the effectiveness, you try A a little bit, B a little bit, but you don't want to harm too many patients."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "So you have to sort of trade off exploring."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "And at some point you want to explore and you can do the mathematics and figure out the optimal strategy."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "They talk about Bayesian agents, they're also non Bayesian agents, but it shows that this Bayesian framework by taking a prior or possible worlds, doing the Bayesian mixture, then the Bayes optimal decision with longterm planning that is important, automatically implies exploration, also to the proper extent, not too much exploration and not too little."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "It is very simple settings."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "In the IXE model, I was also able to prove that it is a self optimizing theorem or asymptotic optimality theorems, although they're only asymptotic, not finite time bounds."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "So it seems like the longterm planning is really important, but the longterm part of the planning is really important."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And also, I mean, maybe a quick tangent, how important do you think is removing the Markov assumption and looking at the full history?"}, {"time": 3805, "text": "Sort of intuitively, of course, it's important, but is it like fundamentally transformative to the entirety of the problem?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Like, cause we all, we make that assumption quite often."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "It's just throwing away the past."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "No, I think it's absolutely crucial."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "The question is whether there's a way to deal with it in a more heuristic and still sufficiently well way."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "So I have to come up with an example and fly, but you have some key event in your life, long time ago in some city or something, you realized that's a really dangerous street or whatever."}, {"time": 3845, "text":

in the past, but somehow selecting the important is."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "That's very hard."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And I'm not concerned about just storing the whole history."}, {"time":

the planning part and the compression for the understanding part."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "The raw storage I'm really not concerned about."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "And I think we should just store, if you develop an agent, preferably just store all the interaction history."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And then you build of course models on top of it and you compress it and you are selective, but occasionally you go back to the old data and reanalyze it based on your new experience you have."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Sometimes you are in school, you learn all these things you think is totally useless and much later you realize, oh, they were not so useless as you thought."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "I'm looking at you, linear algebra."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "So maybe let me ask about objective functions because that rewards, it seems to be an important part."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "The rewards are kind of given to the system."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "For a lot of

very interesting question."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And I'm asked a lot about this question, where do the rewards come from?"}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And that depends."}, {"time": 3977, "text":

agent based on the IXE model, which performs a particular task."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "Let's start with something super simple, like, I mean, super simple, like playing chess, or go or something, yeah."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "Then you just, the reward is winning the game is plus one, losing the game is minus one, done."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You apply this agent."}, {"time": 4006,

have more complicated problems, then you may believe that you have the right reward, but it's not."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "So a nice, cute example is the elevator control that is also in Rich

elevator."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "Long wait is bad."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "You program it and you do it."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "And what happens is the elevator eagerly picks up all the people, but never drops them off."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So then you realize, oh, maybe the time in the elevator also counts, so you minimize the sum, yeah?"}, {"time": 4056, "text": "And the

"text": "So even in apparently simple problems, you can make mistakes, yeah?"}, {"time": 4071, "text": "And that's what in more serious contexts AGI safety researchers consider."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "So now let's go back to general agents."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "So assume you want to build an agent, which is generally useful to humans, yeah?"}, {"time": 4085, "text": "So you have a household robot, yeah?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And it should do all kinds of tasks."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "So in this case, the human should give the reward on the fly."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "I mean, maybe it's pre trained in the factory and that there's some sort of internal reward for the battery level or whatever, yeah?"}, {"time": 4099, "text": "But so it does the dishes badly, you punish the robot, it does it good, you reward the robot and then train it to a new task, yeah, like a child, right?"}, {"time": 4108, "text": "So you need the human in the loop."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "If you want a system, which is useful to the human."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And as long as these agents stay subhuman level, that should work reasonably well, apart from these

they become older, the reward technique doesn't work so well anymore."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "So then finally, so this would be agents, which are just, you could say slaves to the humans, yeah?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "So if you are more ambitious and just say, we want to build a new species of intelligent beings, we put them on a new planet and we want them to develop this planet or whatever."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "So we don't give them any reward."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "So what could we do?"}, {"time": 4156, "text": "And you could try to come up with some reward functions like it should maintain itself, the robot, it should maybe multiply, build more robots, right?"}, {"time": 4168, "text": "And maybe all kinds of things which you find useful, but that's pretty hard, right?"}, {"time": 4174, "text": "What does self maintenance mean?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "What does it mean to build a copy?"}, {"time": 4178, "text": "Should it be exact copy, an approximate copy?"}, {"time": 4180, "text": "And so that's really hard, but Laurent also at DeepMind developed a beautiful model."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "So it just took the ICSE model and coupled the rewards to information gain."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "So he said the reward is proportional to how much the agent had learned about the world."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "And you can rigorously, formally, uniquely define that in terms of archival versions, okay?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "So if you put that in, you get a completely autonomous agent."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "And actually, interestingly, for this agent, we can prove much stronger result than for the general agent, which is also nice."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And if you let this agent loose, it will be in a sense, the optimal scientist."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "It is absolutely curious to learn as much as possible about the world."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "And of course, it will also have a lot of instrumental

exploration or whatever is necessary, right, to gathering information and develop it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "So it has a lot of instrumental goals falling on this information gain."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "And this agent is completely autonomous of us."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "No rewards necessary anymore."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "Yeah, of course, it could find a way to game the

with at least stochasticity."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "Yeah, what about curiosity?"}, {"time": 4283, "text": "This kind of word, curiosity, creativity, is that kind of the reward function being of getting new information?"}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Is that similar to idea of kind of injecting exploration for its own sake inside the reward function?"}, {"time": 4301, "text": "Do you find this at all appealing, interesting?"}, {"time": 4304, "text": "I think that's a nice definition."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "Curiosity is rewards."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Sorry, curiosity is exploration for its own sake."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Yeah, I would accept that."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "But most curiosity, well, in humans, and especially in children, is not just for its own sake, but for

further."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "So one of the assumptions is kind of infinity keeps creeping up everywhere, which, what are your thoughts on kind of bounded rationality and sort of the nature of

one point?"}, {"time": 4461, "text": "Do you think it's, do you think the bounded resources are fundamental to intelligence?"}, {"time": 4467, "text": "I would say that an intelligence notion, which

this model, but this is more a nuisance than a feature."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And I'm sometimes wondering if artificial intelligence would not sit in a computer science department, but in a

4555, "text": "That's actually quite a deep idea, or even to at least to think about big picture philosophical questions, big picture questions, even in the computer science department."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "But you've mentioned approximation."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "Sort of, there's a lot of infinity, a lot of huge resources needed."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "Are there approximations to IXE that within the IXE framework that are useful?"}, {"time": 4579, "text": "Yeah, we have developed a couple of approximations."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And what we do there is that the Solomov

part will become."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "We focus on a particular compressor called context tree weighting, which is pretty amazing, not so well known."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It has beautiful

familiar with it."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "He developed it while I was in his lab."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "Yeah, so the Ghetto Machine, to explain it briefly, you give it a task."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "It could be a simple task as, you know, finding prime factors in numbers, right?"}, {"time": 4712, "text": "You can formally write it down."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "There's a very slow algorithm to do that."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "Just try all the factors, yeah."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Or play chess, right?"}, {"time": 4719, "text": "Optimally, you write the algorithm to minimax to the end of the game."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "So you write down what the Ghetto Machine should do."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "Then it will take part of its resources to run this program and other part of its resources to improve this program."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And when it finds an improved version, which provably computes the same answer."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So that's the key part, yeah."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "It needs to prove by itself that this change of program still satisfies the original specification."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "And if it does so, then it replaces the original program by the improved program."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And by definition, it does the same job, but just faster, okay?"}, {"time": 4757, "text": "And then, you know, it proves over it and over it."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And it's developed in a way that all parts of this Ghetto Machine can self improve, but it stays provably consistent with the original specification."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So from this perspective, it has nothing to do with iXe."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "But if you would now put iXe as the starting axioms in, it would run iXe, but you know, that takes forever."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "But then if it finds a provable speed up of iXe, it would replace it by this and this and this."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "And maybe eventually it comes up with a model which is still the iXe model."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "It cannot be, I mean, just for the knowledgeable reader, iXe is incomputable and that can prove that therefore there cannot be a computable exact algorithm computers."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "There needs to be some approximations and this is not dealt with the Ghetto Machine."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "So you have to do something about it."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "But there's the iXe TL model, which is finitely computable, which we could put in."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "Which part of iXe is noncomputable?"}, {"time": 4819, "text": "The Solomonov induction part."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "The induction, okay, so."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "But there is ways of getting computable approximations of the iXe model, so then it's at least computable."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "It is still way beyond any resources anybody will ever have, but then the Ghetto Machine could sort of improve it further and further in an exact way."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "So is it theoretically possible that the Ghetto Machine process could improve?"}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Isn't iXe already optimal?"}, {"time": 4851, "text": "It is optimal in terms of the reward collected over its interaction cycles, but it takes infinite time to produce one action."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "And the world continues whether you want it or not."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "So the model is assuming you had an oracle, which solved this problem, and then in the next 100 milliseconds or the reaction time you need gives the answer, then iXe is optimal."}, {"time": 4878, "text": "It's optimal in sense of also from learning efficiency and data efficiency, but not in terms of computation time."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And then the Ghetto Machine in theory, but probably not provably could make it go faster."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "Those two components are super interesting."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "The sort of the perfect intelligence combined with self improvement, sort of provable self improvement since you're always getting the correct answer and you're improving."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "Beautiful ideas."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Okay, so you've also mentioned that different kinds of things in the chase of solving this reward, sort of optimizing for the goal, interesting human things could emerge."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "So is there a place for consciousness within iXe?"}, {"time": 4930, "text": "Where does, maybe you can comment, because I suppose we humans are just another instantiation of iXe agents and we seem to have consciousness."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "You say humans are an instantiation of an iXe agent?"}, {"time": 4944, "text": "Well, that would be amazing, but I think that's not true even for the smartest and most rational humans."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "I think maybe we are very crude approximations."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "I mean, I tend to believe, again, I'm Russian, so I tend to believe our flaws are part of the optimal."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So we tend to laugh off and criticize our flaws and I tend to think that that's actually close to an optimal behavior."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "Well, some flaws, if you think more carefully about it, are actually not flaws, yeah, but I think there are still enough flaws."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "As a student of history, I think all the suffering that we've endured as a civilization, it's possible that that's the optimal amount of suffering we need to endure to minimize longterm suffering."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "That's your Russian background, I think."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "That's the Russian."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Whether humans are or not instantiations of an iXe agent, do you think there's a consciousness of something that could emerge in a computational form or framework like iXe?"}, {"time": 5009, "text": "Let me also ask you a question."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "Do you think I'm conscious?"}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Yeah, that's a good question."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "That tie is confusing me, but I think so."},

dressed similarly to you."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "That because there's a kind of flamboyant, interesting, complex behavior pattern that sells that you're human and you're conscious."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "But why do you ask?"}, {"time": 5046, "text": "Was it a yes or was it a no?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "Yes, I think you're conscious, yes."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "So, and you explained sort of somehow why, but you infer that from my behavior, right?"}, {"time": 5058, "text": "You can never be sure about that."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And I think the same thing will happen with any intelligent agent we develop if it behaves in a way sufficiently close to humans or maybe even not humans."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "I mean, maybe a dog is also sometimes a little bit self conscious, right?"}, {"time": 5075, "text": "So if it behaves in a way where we attribute typically consciousness, we would attribute consciousness to these intelligent systems."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And I see probably in particular that of course doesn't answer the question whether it's really conscious."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "And that's the big hard problem of consciousness."},

close enough to consciousness from a perspective of AGI that the distinction of the hard problem of consciousness is not an interesting one?"}, {"time": 5111, "text": "I think we don't have to worry

the technical problems and this system will behave intelligent and then super intelligent."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "And this consciousness will emerge."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "I mean, definitely it will display behavior which we will interpret as conscious."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "And then it's a philosophical question."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Did this consciousness really emerge or is it a zombie which just, you know, fakes everything?"}, {"time": 5143, "text": "We still don't have to figure that out."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "Although it may be interesting, at least from a philosophical point of view, it's very interesting, but it may also be sort of practically interesting."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "You know, there's some people saying, if it's just faking consciousness and feelings, you know, then we don't need to be concerned about, you know, rights."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "But if it's real conscious and has feelings, then we need to be concerned,

have any of those fun things."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "But you have heard about this Tamagotchi, which was, you know, really, really primitive, actually, for the time it was, and, you know, you could raise, you know, this, and kids got so attached to it and, you know, didn't want to let it die and probably, if we would have asked, you know, the children, do you think this Tamagotchi is conscious?"}, {"time": 5219, "text": "They would have said yes."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "Half of them would have said yes, I would guess."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "I think that's kind of a

right?"}, {"time": 5276, "text": "You know, AI winters and AI summers, and then there were big promises which were not fulfilled, and people got disappointed."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And that

up."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So what do you think, we talked about the formal big light at the end of the tunnel, but from the engineering perspective, what do you think it takes to build an AGI

probably not large enough."}, {"time": 939, "text": "Today, we're in a state where there's probably four or five, maybe even more, well, it depends for which autoimmune disease, but there are multiple drugs that can help people with autoimmune disease, many of which didn't exist 12 years ago."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And I think we're at a golden time in some ways in drug discovery where there's the ability to create drugs that are much more safe and much more effective than we've ever been able to before."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And what's lacking is enough understanding of biology and

Citro, which is, like you mentioned, perhaps the focus is drug discovery and the utilization of machine learning for drug discovery."}, {"time": 998, "text": "So you mentioned that, quote, we're really interested in creating what you might call a disease in a dish model, disease in a dish models, places where diseases are complex, where we really haven't had a good model system, where typical animal models that have been used for years, including testing on mice, just aren't very effective."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So can you try to describe what is an animal model and what is a disease in a dish model?"}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So an animal model for disease is where you create effectively, it's what it sounds like."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "It's oftentimes a mouse where we have introduced some external perturbation that creates the disease and then we cure that disease."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And the hope is that by doing that, we will cure a similar disease in the human."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "The problem is that oftentimes the way in which we generate the disease in the animal has nothing to do with how that disease actually comes about in a human."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "It's what you might think of as a copy of the phenotype, a copy of the clinical outcome, but the mechanisms are quite different."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And so curing the disease in the animal, which in most cases doesn't happen naturally, mice don't get Alzheimer's, they don't get diabetes, they don't get atherosclerosis, they don't get autism or schizophrenia."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "Those cures don't translate over to what happens in the human."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And that's where most drugs fails just because the findings that we had in the mouse don't translate to a human."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "The disease in the dish models is a fairly new approach."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "It's been enabled by technologies that have not existed for more than five to 10 years."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So for instance, the ability for us to take a cell from any one of us, you or me, revert that say skin cell to what's called stem cell status, which is what's called the pluripotent cell that can then be differentiated into different types of cells."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So from that pluripotent cell, one can create a Lex neuron or a Lex cardiomyocyte or a Lex hepatocyte that has your genetics, but that right cell type."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And so if there's a genetic burden of disease that would manifest in that particular cell type, you might be able to see it by looking at those cells and saying, oh, that's what potentially sick cells look like versus healthy cells and then explore what kind of interventions might revert the unhealthy looking cell to a healthy cell."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Now, of course, curing cells is not the same as curing people."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "So that's really what we're hoping to do."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "That step, that backward step, I was reading about it, the Yamanaka factor."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So it's like that reverse step back to stem cells."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Seems like magic."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "Honestly, before that happened, I think very few people would have predicted that to be possible."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Can you maybe elaborate, is it actually possible?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Like where, like how stable?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "So this result was maybe like, I don't know how many years ago, maybe 10 years ago was first demonstrated, something like that."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Is this, how hard is this?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Like how noisy is this backward step?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It seems quite incredible and cool."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "It is, it is incredible and cool."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It was much more, I think finicky and bespoke at the early stages when the discovery was first made."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "But at this point, it's become almost industrialized."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "There are what's called contract research organizations, vendors that will take a sample from a human and revert it back to stem cell status."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And it works a very good fraction of the time."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Now there are people who will ask, I think good questions."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Is this really truly a stem cell or does it remember certain aspects of what, of changes that were made in the human beyond the genetics?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "It's passed as a skin cell, yeah."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "It's passed as a skin cell or it's passed in terms of exposures to different environmental factors and so on."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "So I think the consensus right now is that these are not always perfect and there is little bits and pieces of memory sometimes, but by and large, these are actually pretty good."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So one of the key things, well, maybe you can correct me, but one of the useful things for machine learning is size, scale of data."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "How easy it is to do these kinds of reversals to stem cells and then disease in a dish models at scale."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Is that a huge challenge or not?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So the reversal is not as of this point something that can be done at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "I think total number of stem cells or IPS cells that are what's called induced pluripotent stem cells in the world I think is somewhere between five and 10,000 last I looked."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Now again, that might not count things that exist in this or that academic center and they may add up to a bit more, but that's about the range."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So it's not something that you could at this point generate IPS cells from a million people, but maybe you don't need to because maybe that background is enough because it can also be now perturbed in different ways."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And some people have done really interesting experiments in for instance, taking cells from a healthy human and then introducing a mutation into it using one of the other miracle technologies that's emerged in the last decade which is CRISPR gene editing and introduced a mutation that is known to be pathogenic."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And so you can now look at the healthy cells and the unhealthy cells, the one with the mutation and do a one on one comparison where everything else is held constant."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And so you could really start to understand specifically what the mutation does at the cellular level."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "So the IPS cells are a great starting point and obviously more diversity is better because you also wanna capture ethnic background and how that affects things, but maybe you don't need one from every single patient with every single type of disease because we have other tools at our disposal."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Well, how much difference is there between people I mentioned ethnic background in terms of IPS cells?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So we're all like, it seems like these magical cells that can do to create anything between different populations, different people."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Is there a lot of variability between cell cells?"}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Well, first of all, there's the variability, that's driven simply by the fact that genetically we're different."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So a stem cell that's derived from my genotype is gonna be different from a stem cell that's derived from your genotype."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "There's also some differences that have more to do with for whatever reason, some people's stem cells differentiate better than other people's stem cells."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "We don't entirely understand why."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So there's certainly some differences there as well, but the fundamental difference and the one that we really care about and is a positive is that the fact that the genetics are different and therefore recapitulate my disease burden versus your disease burden."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "What's a disease burden?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Well, a disease burden is just if you think, I mean, it's not a well defined mathematical term, although there are mathematical formulations of it."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "If you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certain disease than others because we have more variations in our genome that are causative of the disease, maybe fewer that are protective of the disease."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "People have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores, which look at all of the variations in an individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk they confer for a particular disease."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And then they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And for certain diseases where we've been sufficiently powered to really understand the connection between the many, many small variations that give rise to an increased disease risk, there's some pretty significant differences in terms of the risk between the people, say at the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowest decile."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Sometimes those differences are factor of 10 or 12 higher."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So there's definitely a lot that our genetics contributes to disease risk, even if it's not by any stretch the full explanation."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And from a machine learning perspective, there's signal there."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "There is definitely signal in the genetics and there's even more signal, we believe, in looking at the cells that are derived from those different genetics because in principle, you could say all the signal is there at the genetics level."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "So we don't need to look at the cells, but our understanding of the biology is so limited at this point than seeing what actually happens at the cellular level is a heck of a lot closer to the human clinical outcome than looking at the genetics directly."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And so we can learn a lot more from it than we could by looking at genetics alone."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "So just to get a sense, I don't know if it's easy to do, but what kind of data is useful in this disease in a dish model?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Like what's the source of raw data information?"}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And also from my outsider's perspective, so biology and cells are squishy things."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "And then how do you connect the computer to that?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "Which sensory mechanisms, I guess."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So that's another one of those revolutions that have happened in the last 10 years in that our ability to measure cells very quantitatively has also dramatically increased."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So back when I started doing biology in the late 90s, early 2000s, that was the initial era where we started to measure biology in really quantitative ways using things like microarrays, where you would measure in a single experiment the activity level, what's called expression level of every gene in the genome in that sample."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And that ability is what actually allowed us to even understand that there are molecular subtypes of diseases like cancer, where up until that point, it's like, oh, you have breast cancer."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "But then when we looked at the molecular data, it was clear that there's different subtypes of breast cancer that at the level of gene activity look completely different to each other."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So that was the beginning of this process."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Now we have the ability to measure individual cells in terms of their gene activity using what's called single cell RNA sequencing, which basically sequences the RNA, which is that activity level of different genes for every gene in the genome."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And you could do that at single cell level."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "So that's an incredibly powerful way of measuring cells."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "I mean, you literally count the number of transcripts."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "So it really turns that squishy thing into something that's digital."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "Another tremendous data source that's emerged in the last few years is microscopy and specifically even super resolution microscopy, where you could use digital reconstruction to look at subcellular structures, sometimes even things that are below the diffraction limit of light by doing a sophisticated reconstruction."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "And again, that gives you a tremendous amount of information at the subcellular level."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "There's now more and more ways that amazing scientists out there are developing for getting new types of information from even single cells."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so that is a way of turning those squishy things into digital data."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "Into beautiful data sets."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "But so that data set then with machine learning tools allows you to maybe understand the developmental, like the mechanism of a particular disease."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And if it's possible to sort of at a high level describe, how does that help lead to a drug discovery that can help prevent, reverse that mechanism?"}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So I think there's different ways in which this data could potentially be used."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Some people use it for scientific discovery and say, oh, look, we see this phenotype at the cellular level."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So let's try and work our way backwards and think which genes might be involved in pathways that give rise to that."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So that's a very sort of analytical method to sort of work our way backwards using our understanding of known biology."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Some people use it in a somewhat more, sort of forward, if that was a backward, this would be forward, which is to say, okay, if I can perturb this gene, does it show a phenotype that is similar to what I see in disease patients?"}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And so maybe that gene is actually causal of the disease."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "So that's a different way."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And then there's what we do, which is basically to take that very large collection of data and use machine learning to uncover the patterns that emerge from it."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So for instance, what are those subtypes that might be similar at the human clinical outcome, but quite distinct when you look at the molecular data?"}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And then if we can identify such a subtype, are there interventions that if I apply it to cells that come from this subtype of the disease and you apply that intervention, it could be a drug or it could be a CRISPR gene intervention, does it revert the disease state to something that looks more like normal, happy, healthy cells?"}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And so hopefully if you see that, that gives you a certain hope that that intervention will also have a meaningful clinical benefit to people."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And there's obviously a bunch of things that you would wanna do after that to validate that, but it's a very different and much less hypothesis driven way of uncovering new potential interventions and might give rise to things that are not the same things that everyone else is already looking at."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "That's, I don't know, I'm just like to psychoanalyze my own feeling about our discussion currently."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "It's so exciting to talk about sort of a machine, fundamentally, well, something that's been turned into a machine learning problem and that says can have so much real world impact."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "That's how I feel too."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "That's kind of exciting because I'm so, most of my day is spent with data sets that I guess closer to the news groups."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So this is a kind of, it just feels good to talk about."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "In fact, I almost don't wanna talk about machine learning."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I wanna talk about the fundamentals of the data set, which is an exciting place to be."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "It's what gets me up in the morning."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It's also what attracts a lot of the people who work at InCetro

"What, with these approaches, what do you hope, what kind of diseases can be helped?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "We mentioned Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "Can you just describe the various kinds of diseases that this approach can help?"}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Well, we don't know."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "And I try and be very cautious about making promises about some things that, oh, we will cure X."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "People make that promise."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "And I think it's, I tried to first deliver and then promise as opposed to the other way around."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "There are characteristics of a disease that make it more likely that this type of approach can potentially be helpful."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "So for instance, diseases that have a very strong genetic basis are ones that are more likely to manifest in a stem cell derived model."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "We would want the cellular models to be relatively reproducible and robust so that you could actually get enough of those cells and in a way that isn't very highly variable and noisy."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "You would want the disease to be relatively contained in one or a small number of cell types that you could actually create in an in vitro, in a dish setting."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "Whereas if it's something that's really broad and systemic and involves multiple cells that are in very distal parts of your body, putting that all in the dish is really challenging."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "So we want to focus on the ones that are most likely to be successful today with the hope, I think, that really smart bioengineers out there are developing better and better systems all the time so that diseases that might not be tractable today might be tractable in three years."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "So for instance, five years ago, these stem cell derived models didn't really exist."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "People were doing most of the work in cancer cells and cancer cells are very, very poor models of most human biology because they're, A, they were cancer to begin with and B, as you passage

papers that start to do that where you can actually start to say, okay, can we do multi organ system stuff?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "There's many challenges to that."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "It's not easy by any stretch, but it might, I'm sure people will figure it out."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And in three years or five years, there will be disease models that we could make for things that we can't make today."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "Yeah, and this conversation would seem almost outdated with the kind of scale that could be achieved in like three years."}, {"time": 2202, "text":

impactful topic of AI in general?"}, {"time": 2232, "text": "So I think the origin story of MOOCs emanates from a number of efforts that occurred at Stanford University around the late 2000s where different individuals within Stanford, myself included, were getting really excited about the opportunities of using online technologies as a way of achieving both improved quality of teaching and also improved scale."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And so Andrew, for instance, led the Stanford Engineering Everywhere, which was sort of an attempt to take 10 Stanford courses and put them online just as video lectures."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "And so those efforts eventually sort of started to interplay with each other and created a tremendous sense of excitement and energy within the Stanford community about the potential of online teaching and led in the fall of 2011 to the launch of the first Stanford MOOCs."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "By the way, MOOCs, it's probably impossible that

what it is."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "Probably so."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "So anyway, so those courses launched in the fall of 2011, and there were, within a matter of weeks, with no real publicity campaign, just a New York Times article that went viral, about 100,000 students or more in each of those courses."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "And I remember this conversation that Andrew and I had."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "We were just like, wow, there's this real need here."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And I think we both felt like, sure, we were accomplished academics and we could go back and go back to our labs, write more papers."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "But if we did that, then this wouldn't happen."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "And it seemed too important not to happen."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "And so we spent a fair bit of time debating, do we wanna do this as a Stanford effort, kind of building on what we'd started?"}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Do we wanna do this as a for profit company?"}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Do we wanna do this as a nonprofit?"}, {"time": 2400, "text": "And we decided ultimately to do it as we did with Coursera."}, {"time": 2404, "text":

surprising to you?"}, {"time": 2419, "text": "How did you at that time and at this time make sense of this need for sort of global education you mentioned that you felt that, wow, the popularity indicates that there's a hunger for sort of globalization of learning."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "I think there is a hunger for learning that, you know, globalization is part of it, but I think it's just a hunger for learning."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "The world has changed in the last 50 years."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It used to be that you finished college, you got a job, by and large, the

{"time": 2465, "text": "Today, we're in a world where the skills that you need for a lot of jobs, they didn't even exist when you went to college."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "And the jobs, and many of the jobs that existed when you went to college don't even exist today or are dying."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "So part of that is due to AI, but not only."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "And we need to find a way of keeping people, giving people access to the skills that they need today."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And I think that's really what's driving a lot of this hunger."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So I think if we even take a step back, for you, all of this started in trying to think of new ways to teach or to, new ways to sort of organize the material and present the material in a way that would help the education process, the pedagogy, yeah."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "So what have you learned about effective education from this process of playing, of experimenting with different ideas?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So we learned a number of things."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Some of which I think could translate back and have translated back effectively to how people teach on campus."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And some of which I think are more specific to people who learn online, more sort of people who learn as part of their daily life."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "So we learned, for instance, very quickly that short is better."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "So people who are especially in the workforce can't do a 15 week semester long course."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "They just can't fit that into their lives."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Sure, can you describe the shortness of what?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "The entirety, so every aspect, so the little lecture, the lecture's short, the course is short."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "We started out, the first online education efforts were actually MIT's OpenCourseWare initiatives."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "And that was recording of classroom lectures and, Hour and a half or something like that, yeah."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And that didn't really work very well."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "I mean, some people benefit."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "I mean, of course they did, but it's not really a very palatable experience for someone who has a job and three kids and they need to run errands and such."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "They can't fit 15 weeks into their life and the hour and a half is really hard."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So we learned very quickly."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "I mean, we started out with short video modules and over time we made them shorter because we realized that 15 minutes was still too long."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "If you wanna fit in when you're waiting in line for your kid's doctor's appointment, it's better if it's five to seven."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "We learned that 15 week courses don't work and you really wanna break this up into shorter units so that there is a natural completion point, gives people a sense of they're really close to finishing something meaningful."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "They can always come back and take part two and part three."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "We also learned that compressing the content works really well because if some people that pace works well and for others, they can always rewind and watch again."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And so people have the ability to then learn at their own pace."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And so that flexibility, the brevity and the flexibility are both things that we found to be very important."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "We learned that engagement during the content is important and the quicker you give people feedback, the more likely they are to be engaged."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "Hence the introduction of these, which we actually was an intuition that I had going in and was then validated using data that introducing some of these sort of little micro quizzes into the lectures really helps."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Self graded as automatically graded assessments really helped too because it gives people feedback."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "See, there you are."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "So all of these are valuable."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "And then we learned a bunch of other things too."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "We did some really interesting experiments, for instance, on gender bias and how having a female role model as an instructor can change the balance of men to women in terms of, especially in STEM courses."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "And you could do that online by doing AB testing in ways that would be really difficult to go on campus."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "Oh, that's exciting."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "But so the shortness, the compression, I mean, that's actually, so that probably is true for all good editing is always just compressing the content, making it shorter."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "So that puts a lot of burden on the creator of the, the instructor and the creator of the educational content."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "Probably most lectures at MIT or Stanford could be five times shorter if the preparation was put enough."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "So maybe people might disagree with that, but like the Christmas, the clarity that a lot of the, like Coursera delivers is, how much effort does that take?"}, {"time": 2750, "text": "So first of all, let me say that it's not clear that that crispness would work as effectively in a face to face setting because people need time to absorb the material."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And so you need to at least pause and give people a chance to reflect and maybe practice."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And that's what MOOCs do is that they give you these chunks of content and then ask you to practice with it."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "And that's where I think some of the newer pedagogy that people are adopting in face to face teaching that have to do with interactive learning and such can be really helpful."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "But both those approaches, whether you're doing that type of methodology in online teaching or in that flipped classroom, interactive teaching."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "What's that, sorry to pause, what's flipped classroom?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Flipped classroom is a way in which online content is used to supplement face to face teaching where people watch the videos perhaps and do some of the exercises before coming to class."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "And then when they come to class, it's actually to do much deeper problem solving oftentimes in a group."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But any one of those different pedagogies that are beyond just standing there and droning on in front of the classroom for an hour and 15 minutes require a heck of a lot more preparation."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "And so it's one of the challenges I think that people have that we had when trying to convince instructors to teach on Coursera."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "And it's part of the challenges that pedagogy experts on campus have in trying to get faculty to teach differently is that it's actually harder to teach that way than it is to stand there and drone."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Do you think MOOCs will replace in person education or become the majority of in person of education of the way people learn in the future?"}, {"time": 2861, "text": "Again, the future could be very far away, but where's the trend going do you think?"}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So I think it's a nuanced and complicated answer."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "I don't think MOOCs will replace face to face teaching."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "I think learning is in many cases a social experience."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And even at Coursera, we had people who naturally formed study groups, even when they didn't have to, to just come and talk to each other."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And we found that that actually benefited their learning in very important ways."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "So there was more success among learners who had those study groups than among ones who didn't."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "So I don't think it's just gonna, oh, we're all gonna just suddenly learn online with a computer and no one else in the same way that recorded music has not replaced live concerts."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Briefly, it might be a difficult question to ask, but there's a lot of people fascinated by artificial intelligence, by machine learning, by deep learning."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Is there a recommendation for the next year or for a lifelong journey of somebody interested in this?"}, {"time": 2961, "text": "How do they begin?"}, {"time": 2963, "text": "How do they enter that learning journey?"}, {"time": 2967, "text": "I think the important thing is first to just get started."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And there's plenty of online content that one can get for both the core foundations of mathematics and statistics and programming."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And then from there to machine learning, I would encourage people not to skip to quickly pass the foundations because I find that there's a lot of people who learn machine learning, whether it's online or on campus without getting those foundations."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And they basically just turn the crank on existing models in ways that A, don't allow for a lot of innovation and an adjustment to the problem at hand, but also B, are sometimes just wrong and they don't even realize that their application is wrong because there's artifacts that they haven't fully understood."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So I think the foundations, machine learning is an important step."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Practice."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "Perhaps a bit of a romanticized question, but what idea in deep learning do you find, have you found in your journey the most beautiful or surprising or interesting?"}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Perhaps not just deep learning, but AI in general, statistics."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I'm gonna answer with two things."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "One would be the foundational concept of end to end training, which is that you start from the raw data and you train something that is not like a single piece, but rather towards the actual goal that you're looking to."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "From the raw data to the outcome, like no details in between."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Well, not no details, but the fact that you, I mean, you could certainly introduce building blocks that were trained towards other tasks."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I'm actually coming to that in my second half of the answer, but it doesn't have to be like a single monolithic blob in the middle."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "Actually, I think that's not ideal, but rather the fact that at the end of the day, you can actually train something that goes all the way from the beginning to the end."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And the other one that I find really compelling is the notion of learning a representation that in its turn, even if it was trained to another task, can potentially be used as a much more rapid starting point to solving a different task."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And that's, I think, reminiscent of what makes people successful learners."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "It's something that is relatively new in the machine learning space."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "I think it's underutilized even relative to today's capabilities, but more and more of how do we learn sort of reusable representation?"}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And so end to end and transfer learning."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Is it surprising to you that neural networks are able to, in many cases, do these things?"}, {"time": 3176, "text": "Is it maybe taken back to when you first would dive deep into neural networks or in general, even today, is it surprising that neural networks work at all and work wonderfully to do this kind of raw end to end and end to end learning and even transfer learning?"}, {"time": 3196, "text": "I think I was surprised by how well when you have large enough amounts of data, it's possible to find a meaningful representation in what is an exceedingly high dimensional space."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "And so I find that to be really exciting and people are still working on the math for that."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "There's more papers on that every year."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And I think it would be really cool if we figured that out, but that to me was a surprise because in the early days when I was starting my way in machine learning and the data sets were rather small, I think we believed, I believed that you needed to have a much more constrained and knowledge rich search space to really make, to really get to a meaningful answer."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "And I think it was true at the time."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "What I think is still a question is will a completely knowledge free approach where there's no prior knowledge going into the construction of the model, is that gonna be the solution or not?"}, {"time": 3271, "text": "It's not actually the solution today in the sense that the architecture of a convolutional neural network that's used for images is actually quite different to the type of network that's used for language and yet different from the one that's used for speech or biology or any other application."}, {"time": 3292, "text": "There's still some insight that goes into the structure of the network to get the right performance."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "Will you be able to come up with a universal learning machine?"}, {"time": 3305, "text": "I wonder if there's always has to be some insight injected somewhere or whether it can converge."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "So you've done a lot of interesting work with probabilistic graphical models in general, Bayesian deep learning and so on."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "Can you maybe speak high level, how can learning systems deal with uncertainty?"}, {"time": 3325, "text": "One of the limitations I think of a lot of machine learning models is that they come up with an answer and you don't know how much you can believe that answer."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "And oftentimes the answer is actually quite poorly calibrated relative to its uncertainties."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Even if you look at where the confidence that comes out of say the neural network at the end, and you ask how much more likely is an answer of 0.8 versus 0.9, it's not really in any way calibrated to the actual reliability of that network and how true it is."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And the further away you move from the training data, the more, not only the more wrong the network is, often it's more wrong and more confident in its wrong answer."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "And that is a serious issue in a lot of application areas."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So I think creating more of an understanding of how do you produce networks that are calibrated in their uncertainty and can also say, you know what, I give up."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "I don't know what to say about this particular data instance because I've never seen something that's sufficiently like it before."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "I think it's going to be really important in mission critical applications, especially ones where human life is at stake and that includes medical applications, but it also includes automated driving because you'd want the network to be able to say, you know what, I have no idea what this blob is that I'm seeing in the middle of the road."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "So I'm just going to stop because I don't want to potentially run over a pedestrian that I don't recognize."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Is there good mechanisms, ideas of how to allow learning systems to provide that uncertainty along with their predictions?"}, {"time": 3474, "text": "Certainly people have come up with mechanisms that involve Bayesian deep learning, deep learning that involves Gaussian processes."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "I mean, there's a slew of different approaches that people have come up with."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "There's methods that use ensembles of networks trained with different subsets of data or different random starting points."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "Those are actually sometimes surprisingly good at creating a sort of set of how confident or not you are in your answer."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "It's very much an area of open research."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "Let's cautiously venture back into the land of philosophy and speaking of AI systems providing uncertainty, somebody like Stuart Russell believes that as we create more and more intelligence systems, it's really important for them to be full of self doubt because if they're given more and more power, we want the way to maintain human control over AI systems or human supervision, which is true."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Like you just mentioned with autonomous vehicles, it's really important to get human supervision when the car is not sure because if it's really confident in cases when it can get in trouble, it's gonna be really problematic."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "So let me ask about sort of the questions of AGI and human level intelligence."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "I mean, we've talked about curing diseases, which is sort of fundamental thing we can have an impact today, but AI people also dream of both understanding and creating intelligence."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Is that something you dream about?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Is that something you think is within our reach to be thinking about as computer scientists?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Well, boy, let me tease apart different parts of that question."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "The worst question."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "Yeah, it's a multi part question."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "So let me start with the feasibility of AGI."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "Then I'll talk about the timelines a little bit and then talk about, well, what controls does one need when thinking about protections in the AI space?"}, {"time": 3610, "text": "So, I think AGI obviously is a longstanding dream that even our early pioneers in the space had, the Turing test and so on are the earliest discussions of that."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "We're obviously closer than we were 70 or so years ago, but I think it's still very far away."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "I think machine learning algorithms today are really exquisitely good pattern recognizers in very specific problem domains where they have seen enough training data to make good predictions."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "You take a machine learning algorithm and you move it to a slightly different version of even that same problem, far less one that's different and it will just completely choke."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "So I think we're nowhere close to the

these series of papers in my career have basically first developed that concept of evolutionary signatures and then apply them to yeast, apply them to flies, apply them to four mammals, apply them to 17 fungi, apply them to 12 Drosophila species, apply them to then 29 mammals and now 200 mammals."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So sorry, so can we."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "So the evolutionary

off, another life form emerged, mammals."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "And that's that whole evolutionary branching that's happened."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "So you kind of have, when you have these evolutionary signatures, is there basically a map of how the genome changed?"}, {"time": 3262, "text": "Yeah, exactly, exactly."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "So now you can go back to this early mammal

function."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "Yeah, so you now have this mapping between all of the set of functions that could all encode the same, all of the set of sequences that can all encode the same function."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "What evolutionary signatures does is that it basically looks at the shape of that distribution of sequences that all encode the same thing."}, {"time": 3433,

evolving."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "So that's exactly what we just did for COVID."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So our paper that we posted in bioRxiv about coronavirus basically took this concept of

bats as the host and a subset of only four or five have ever infected humans."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "And we basically took all of those and we aligned them in the same exact way that we've aligned mammals."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And then we looked at what proteins are, which of the currently hypothesized genes for the coronavirus genome are in fact evolving like proteins and which ones are

all."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "It's an RNA structure."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "That doesn't have a."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "It doesn't get translated into amino acids."}, {"time": 3545, "text":

other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed is that within ORF3A lies a tiny little additional gene encoded within the other gene."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "So you can translate a DNA sequence in three different reading frames."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "If you start in the first one, it's ATG, et cetera."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "If you start on the second one, it's TGC, et

3581, "text": "So we don't even know the building blocks of SARS COVID 2."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "So if we want to understand coronavirus biology and eventually find it successfully, we need to even have the set of genes and these evolutionary signatures that I developed in my PhD work."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "Are you really useful here?"}, {"time": 3596, "text": "We just recently

3608, "text": "What's your sense about the genome, the proteins, the functions that we understand about COVID 19?"}, {"time": 3616, "text": "Where do we stand in your sense?"}, {"time": 3618, "text": "What are the big open problems?"}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And also, you kind of said it's important to understand what are the important proteins and why is that important?"}, {"time": 3634, "text": "So what else does the comparison of these species tell us?"}, {"time": 3639, "text": "What it tells us is how fast are things evolving?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "It tells us about at what level is the acceleration or deceleration pedal set for every one of these proteins."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "So the genome has 30 some genes."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "Some genes evolve super, super fast."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "Others evolve super, super slow."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "If you look at the polymerase gene that basically replicates the genome, that's a super slow evolving one."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "If you look at the nucleocapsid protein, that's also super slow evolving."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "If you look at the spike one protein, this is the part of the spike protein that actually touches the ACE2 receptor and then enables the virus to attach to your cells."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "That's the thing that gives it that visual... Yeah, the corona look basically."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "The corona look, yeah."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus and there's a first part of the protein S1 which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "And then S2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels the fusion of the membranes and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "So if you look at the stop versus gas pedal, the gas pedal is all the way down."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "ORF8 is also evolving super fast and ORF6 is evolving super fast."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "We have no idea what they do."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "We have some idea but nowhere near what S1 is."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So what the..."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Isn't that terrifying that S1 is evolving?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "That means that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fast, doesn't that mean new strains could be created or it does something?"}, {"time": 3741, "text": "That means that it's searching for how to match, how to best match the host."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "So basically anything in general in evolution, if you look at genomes, anything that's contacting the environment is evolving much faster than anything that's internal."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "And the reason is that the environment changes."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses, the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly because it's attaching to different hosts each time."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "We think of them as bats, but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat, you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor that you're gonna be facing in that new species."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Sorry, quick tangent."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "Is it fascinating to you that viruses are doing this?"}, {"time": 3783, "text": "I mean, it feels like they're this intelligent organism."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "I mean, does it give you pause how incredible it is that the evolutionary dynamics that you're describing is actually happening and they're freaking out, figuring out how to jump from bats to humans all in this distributed fashion?"}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And then most of us don't even say they're alive or intelligent or whatever."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "So intelligence is in the eye of the beholder."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say, and intelligent is as intelligent does."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "So basically if the virus is finding solutions that we think of as intelligent, yeah, it's probably intelligent, but that's again in the eye of the beholder."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "Do you think viruses are intelligent?"}, {"time": 3825, "text": "Oh, of course not."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "It's so incredible."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "So remember when I was talking about the two components of evolution, one is the stupid mutation, which is completely blind, and the other one is the super smart selection, which is ruthless."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "So it's not viruses who are smart."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "It's this component of evolution that's smart."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "So it's evolution that sort of appears smart."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "And how is that happening?"}, {"time": 3852, "text": "By huge parallel search across thousands of parallel of parallel infections throughout the world right now."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Yes, but so to push back on that, so yes, so then the intelligence is in the mechanism, but then by that argument, viruses would be more intelligent because there's just more of them."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "So the search, they're basically the brute force search that's happening with viruses because there's so many more of them than humans, then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "I mean, so you don't think it's possible that, I mean, who runs, would we even be here if viruses weren't, I mean, who runs this thing?"}, {"time": 3898, "text": "So humans or viruses?"}, {"time": 3899, "text": "So let me answer, yeah, let me answer your question."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "So we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "And part of the reason is that if you look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new classes of regulatory proteins."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And these binding sites that landed all over our genome are now control elements that basically control our genes and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry of mammalian genomes."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "So, you know, everything's coevolution."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "That's fascinating, we're working together."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And yet you say they're dumb."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "We've coopted them."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "No, I never said they're dumb."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "They just don't care."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "They don't care."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "Another thing, oh, is the virus trying to kill us?"}, {"time": 3958, "text": "The virus is not trying to kill you."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "It's actually actively trying to not kill you."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "So when you get infected, if you die, bomber, I killed him, is what the reaction of the virus will be."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "Because that virus won't spread."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "Many people have a misconception of, oh, viruses are smart or oh, viruses are mean."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "It's like, you have to clean yourself of any kind of anthropomorphism out there."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "So there's a sense when taken as a whole that there's..."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "It's in the eye of the beholder."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "Stupid is as stupid does."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "Intelligent is as intelligent does."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So if you want to call them intelligent, that's fine."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "Because the end result is that they're finding amazing solutions."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "I mean, I am in awe."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "They're so dumb about it."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "They're just doing dumb."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "They're not dumb and they're just don't care."},

prefers not to kill us."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "It just wants to spread."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "And when I say wants, again, I'm anthropomorphizing, but it's just that if you have two versions of a virus, one acquires a mutation that spreads more, that's going to spread more."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "One acquires a mutation that spreads less, that's going to be lost."}, {"time": 4041,

again, and yet never fully wiped out."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So yeah, I'm not concerned about the human race."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "I'm not even concerned about the impact on sort of our survival as a species."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "This is absolutely something, I mean, human life is so invaluable and every one of us is so invaluable, but if you think of it as sort of, is this the end of our species?"}, {"time": 4364, "text": "By no means, basically."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "So let me explain."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "The Black Death killed what, 30% of Europe?"}, {"time": 4371, "text": "That has left a tremendous imprint, a huge hole, a horrendous hole in the genetic makeup of humans."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "There's been series of wiping out of huge fractions of entire species or just entire species altogether."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "And that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "If you look at how Europe was shaped and how Africa was shaped by malaria, for example, all the individuals that carry a mutation that protects you from malaria were able to survive much more."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequency of malaria, the maps are actually showing the same pattern, the same imprint on Africa."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "And that basically led people to hypothesize that the reason why sickle cell disease is so much more frequent is because sickle cell disease is so much more frequent in Americans of African descent is because there was selection in Africa against malaria leading to sickle cell, because when the cells sickle, malaria is not able to replicate inside your cells as well."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "And therefore you protect against that."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "So if you look at human disease, all of the genetic associations that we do with human disease, you basically see the imprint of these waves of selection killing off gazillions of humans."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And there's so many immune processes that are coming up as associated with so many different diseases."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "The reason for that is similar to what I was describing earlier, where the outward facing proteins evolve much more rapidly because the environment is always changing."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "But what's really interesting in the human genome is that we have coopted many of these immune genes to carry out nonimmune functions."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "For example, in our brain, we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections that don't get used."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "This whole use it or lose it, we know the mechanism."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "It's microglia that cleave off neuronal synaptic connections that are just not utilized."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "When you utilize them, you mark them in a particular way that basically when the microglia come, tell it, don't kill this one, it's used now."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "And the microglia will go off and kill the ones you don't use."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "This is an immune function, which is coopted to do nonimmune things."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "If you look at our adipocytes, M1 versus M2 macrophages inside our fat will basically determine whether you're obese or not."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "And these are again, immune cells that are resident and living within these tissues."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "So many disease associations."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "That's it, that we coopt these kinds of things for incredibly complicated functions."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Exactly, evolution works in so many different ways, which are all beautiful and mysterious."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "But not intelligent."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Not intelligent, it's in the eye of the beholder."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "But the point that I'm trying to make is that if you look at the imprint that COVID will have, hopefully it will not be big."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "Hopefully the US will get attacked together and stop the virus from spreading further."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "But if it doesn't, it's having an imprint on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So if you look at now the genetic associations of blood type and immune function cells, et cetera, there's actually association, genetic variation that basically says how much more likely am I or you to die if we contact the virus."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "And it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome that humans have basically made it so far."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "And selection is ruthless and it's brutal and it only comes with a lot of killing."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "But this is the way that viruses and environments have shaped the human genome."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "Basically, when you go through periods of famine, you select for particular genes."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And what's left is not necessarily better, it's just whatever survived."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And it might have been the surviving one back then, not because it was better, maybe the ones that ran slower survived."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "I mean, again, not necessarily better, but the surviving ones are basically the ones that then are shaped for any kind of subsequent evolutionary condition and environmental condition."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "But if you look at, for example, obesity, obesity was selected for basically the genes that now predisposes to obesity were at 2% frequency in Africa."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "They rose to 44% frequency in Europe."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "Wow, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "Because you basically went through the ice ages and there was a scarcity of food."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So there was a selection to being able to store every single calorie you consume."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "Eventually, environment changes."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "So the better allele, which was the fat storing allele, became the worst allele because it's the fat storing allele."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "It still has the same function."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "So if you look at my genome, speaking of mom calling, mom gave me a bad copy of that gene, this FTO locus."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Basically, makes me."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "The one that has to do with."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "Obesity."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "With obesity."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "Yeah, I basically now have a bad copy from mom that makes me more likely to be obese."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "And I also have a bad copy from dad that makes me more likely to be obese."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "So homozygous."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "And that's the allele, it's still the minor allele, but it's at 44% frequency in Southeast Asia, 42% frequency in Europe, even though it started at 2%."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "It was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "Right now, it's pretty terrible allele."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "So the other concept is that diversity matters."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "If we had 100 million nuclear physicists living the earth right now, we'd be in trouble."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "You need diversity, you need artists and you need musicians and you need mathematicians and you need politicians, yes, even those."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And you need like."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Well, let's not get crazy."}, {"time": 4719, "text": "But because then if a virus comes along or whatever."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "So, no, there's two reasons."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "Number one, you want diversity in the immune repertoire and we have built in diversity."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "So basically, they are the most diverse."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "Basically, if you look at our immune system, there's layers and layers of diversity."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Like the way that you create your cells generates diversity because of the selection for the VDJ recombination that basically eventually leads to a huge number of repertoires."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "But that's only one small component of diversity."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "The blood type is another one."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "The major histocompatibility complex, the HLA alleles are another source of diversity."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "So the immune system of humans is by nature, incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "So basically what I'm saying that I don't worry for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically, we are likely to be very resilient against so many different attacks like this current virus."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "So you're saying natural pandemics may not be something that you're really afraid of because of the diversity in our genetic makeup."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "What about engineered pandemics?"}, {"time": 4790, "text": "Do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses or well, yeah, let's say with the makeup of viruses to create something that we can't control and would be much more destructive than it would come about naturally?"}, {"time": 4805, "text": "Remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is?"}, {"time": 4808, "text": "Humans are much dumber."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "You mean like human scientists, engineers?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "Yeah, humans, humans just like."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "Humans overall?"}, {"time": 4814, "text": "Yeah, humans overall."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "But I mean, even the sort of synthetic biologists you know, basically if you were to create, you know, virus like SARS that will kill a lot of people, you would probably start with SARS."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "So whoever, you know, would like to design such a thing

the human race."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "So you don't believe it was engineered?"}, {"time": 4872, "text": "Or likely."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Yeah, the path to engineering a deadly virus did not come from this strain that was used."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Moreover, there's been various claims of, ha ha, this was mixed and matched in lab because the S1 protein has three different components, each of which has a different evolutionary tree."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So, you know, a lot of popular press basically said, aha, this came from pangolin and this came from, you know, all kinds of other species."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "This is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus tree."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "So basically the S1 protein has been recombining across species all the time."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "Remember when I was talking about the positive strand, the negative strand, sub genomic RNAs, these can actually recombine."}, {"time": 4915,

for millions of years and, you know, changing."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "This happens naturally."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "That's, again, beautiful that that somehow happens, that they recombine."},

all, like."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "Yeah, that's why classification wise, virus is not thought to be alive because it doesn't self replicate."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "It's not autonomous."},

the..."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So again, it returns against free will."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "On the free will side of things, is there something we could do to strengthen our immune system in

better."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "So there's something to be said about sort of positive thinking, about optimism, about sort of just getting your brain and your mind into the right mindset that

the way to think about that is the following."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "The converse of the equation is something that we are much more comfortable with."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Like, oh, if

the code and then we'll expand to the rest."}, {"time": 5784, "text": "So the code itself is digital."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "So there's genes."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "You can think of the genes as, I don't know, the procedures, the functions inside your language."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "And then somehow you have to turn these functions on."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "How do you call a gene?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "How do you call that function?"}, {"time": 5799, "text": "The way that you would do it in old programming languages is go to address whatever in your memory and then

"text": "And if you look at viruses, the reason why they're so elegant when you look at the design of this, you know, genome, it seems so elegant."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "And the reason for that is that it's been stripped down from something much larger because of the pressure to keep it compact."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "So many compact genomes out there have ancestors that were much larger."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "You don't start small and become big."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff, increase complexity, and then, you know, slim it down."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "And one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "One of the things we found is that baker's yeast, which is the, you know, yeast that you use to make bread, but also the yeast that you use to make wine, which is basically the dominant species when you go in the fields of Tuscany and you say, you know, what's out there, it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae, or the way my Italian friends say, saccharomyces cerevisiae."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "Oh, which means what?"}, {"time": 6094, "text": "Oh, saccharomyces, okay, I'm sorry, I'm Greek."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "So yeah, zacharo, mikis, zacharo is sugar, mikis is fungus."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Yes, cerevisiae, cerveza, beer."}, {"time": 6104, "text":

saccharomyces cerevisiae, basically the major baker's yeast out there is the descendant of a whole genome duplication."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Why would a whole gene duplication even happen?"}, {"time": 6122, "text": "When it happened is coinciding with about a hundred million years ago and the emergence of fruit bearing plants."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "Why fruit bearing plants?"}, {"time": 6135, "text": "Because animals would eat the fruit and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients along with a seed for the plants to spread."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "Before that, plants were not spreading through animals, they were spreading through wind and all kinds of other ways."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants, these plants are basically creating this abundance of sugar in the environment."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "So there's an evolutionary niche that gets created."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And in that evolutionary niche, you basically have enough sugar that a whole genome duplication, which initially is a very messy event, allows you to then, you know, relieve some of that complexity."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "So I had to pause, what does genome duplication mean?"}, {"time": 6179, "text": "That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes, you can now have 16 chromosomes."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "So, but the duplication at first, when you go to 16, you're not using that."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Oh yeah, you are."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "Yeah, so basically from one day to the next, you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "Probably a non disjunction event during a duplication, during a division."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "So you basically divide the cell instead of half the genome going this way and half the genome going the other way after duplication of the genome, you basically have all of it going to one cell and then there's sufficient messiness there that you end up with slight differences that make most of these chromosomes be actually preserved."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "It's a long story short to me."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "But that's a big upgrade, right?"}, {"time": 6225, "text": "So that's... Not necessarily, because what happens immediately thereafter is that you start massively losing tons of those duplicated genes."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "So 90% of those genes were actually lost very rapidly after whole gene duplication."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent, it's just ruthless selection, random mutation."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "So the ruthless selection basically means that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene, ruthless selection just kills off that gene."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "It's just, if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome, you will very rapidly lose the second copy of most of your genes and a small number 10% were kept in two copies."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation, with the speed of replication, with the speed of translation and with sugar processing."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "So I'm making a long story short to basically say that evolution is messy."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "The only way... Like, so the example that I was giving of messing with 20% of your bits in your computer, totally bogus."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "Duplicating all your functions and just throwing them out there in the same function, just totally bogus."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "Like this would never work in an engineer system."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "But biological systems, because of this content based indexing and because of this modularity that comes from the fact that the gene is controlled by a series of tags."}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And now if you need this gene in another setting, you just add some more tags that will basically turn it on also in those settings."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions and it builds up complexity."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "I see a whole gene duplication and gene duplication in general as a way to relieve that complexity."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "So you have this gradual buildup of complexity as functions get sort of added onto the existing genes."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "And then boom, you duplicate your workforce."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "And you now have two copies of this gene."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "One will probably specialize to do one and the other one will specialize to do the other or one will maintain the ancestral function."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "The other one will sort of be free to evolve and specialize while losing the ancestral function and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "So that's how genomes evolve."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "They're just messy things, but they're extremely fault tolerant and they're extremely able to deal with mutations because that's the very way that you generate new functions."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "So new functionalization comes from the very thing that breaks it."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "So even in the current pandemic, many people are asking me which mutations matter the most."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "And what I tell them is, well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the current genome to then understand which mutations have previously happened or not."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "And which mutations happen in genes that evolve rapidly or not."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "And one of the things we found, for example, is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "The genes that evolved slowly in the past are still evolving slowly."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "Which means that they're useful?"}, {"time": 6401, "text": "Which means that they're under the same evolutionary pressures."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "But then the question is what happens in specific mutations?"}, {"time": 6409, "text": "So if you look at the D614 gene mutations, that's been all over the news."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "So in position 614, in the amino acids 614 of the S protein, there's a D2 gene mutation that sort of has creeped over the population."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "That mutation, we found out through my work, disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of equivalent per million evolution of these viruses."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "That basically means that it's a completely new adaptation to human."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "So this mutation, I like how you say the 416, what was it, okay."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "Yeah, 614, sorry."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "614."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "D614G."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "D614, so literally, so what you're saying is this is like a chess move."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So it just mutated one letter to another."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "And that hasn't happened before."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "Yeah, never."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "And this somehow, this mutation is really useful."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "It's really useful in the current environment of the genome, which is moving from human to human."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "When it was moving from bat to bat, it couldn't care less for that mutation, but it's environment specific."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "So now that it's moving from human to human, it's moving way better, like by orders of magnitude."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "What do you, okay, so you're like tracking this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating, but what do you do with that?"}, {"time": 6505, "text": "What does this mean, what do you make, what do you make of this mutation in trying to anticipate, I guess, is one of the things you're trying to do is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future, this evolutionary dynamics."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Such a great question."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "So there's two things."}, {"time": 6522, "text": "Remember when I was saying earlier, mutation is the path to new things, but also the path to break old things."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So what we know is that this position was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "That mutation was never tolerated when it was moving from bats to bats."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "So that basically means that that position is extremely important in the function of that protein."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "That's the first thing it tells."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "The second one is that that position was very well suited to bat transmission, but now is not well suited to human transmission, so it got rid of it."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "And it now has a new version of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit from human to human."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "So in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us about the future, it basically tells us here's the regions that are currently mutating."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "Here's the regions that are most likely to mutate going forward."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "As you're building a vaccine, here's what you should be focusing on in terms of the most stable regions that are the least likely to mutate."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "Or here's the newly evolved functions that are the most likely to be important because they've overcome this local maximum that it had reached in the bat transmission."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "So anyway, it's a tangent to basically say that evolution works in messy ways."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "And the thing that you would break is the thing that actually allows you to first go through a lull and then reaching new local maximum."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "And I often like to say that if engineers had basically designed evolution, we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria because it's my making the bacterium worse that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum."},

6645, "text": "We as engineers need to embrace breaking things."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "We as engineers need to embrace robustness as the first principle beyond perfection because nothing's gonna ever be perfect."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "And when you're sending a satellite to Mars, when something goes wrong, it'll break down."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "As opposed to building systems that tolerate failure and are resilient to that."}, {"time": 6668, "text": "And in fact, get better through that."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "So the SpaceX approach versus NASA for the...

want you to pause for a second and realize the complexity of the entire human brain with trillions of connections within our neurons, with millions of cells talking to each other, is still encoded

actually a rimless wheel."}, {"time": 325, "text": "So imagine taking a bicycle wheel, but take the rim off."}, {"time": 330, "text": "So it's now just got a bunch of spokes."}, {"time": 332, "text":

tiring work swimming upstream."}, {"time": 628, "text": "They're hanging out behind the rocks."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Maybe there's something energetically interesting there."}, {"time": 631,

of the rock that you would see in a stream."}, {"time": 644, "text": "And they put a real fish behind this and watched how it swims."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And the amazing thing is that if you watch from above what the fish swims when it's not behind a rock, it has a particular gate."}, {"time": 656, "text": "You can identify the fish the same way you look at a human walking down the street."}, {"time": 659, "text": "You sort of have a sense of how a human walks."}, {"time": 662, "text": "The fish has a characteristic gate."}, {"time": 665, "text": "You put that fish behind the rock, its gate changes."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And what they saw was that it was actually resonating and kind of surfing between the vortices."}, {"time": 676, "text": "Now, here was the experiment that really was the clincher."}, {"time": 680, "text": "Because there was still, it wasn't clear how much of that was mechanics of the fish, how much of that is control, the brain."}, {"time": 686,

vortex wake until something sort of amazing happens."}, {"time": 717, "text": "And this video is worth putting in, right?"}, {"time": 724, "text": "The dead fish basically starts swimming upstream, right?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "It's completely dead, no brain, no motors, no control."}, {"time": 732, "text": "But it's somehow the mechanics of the fish resonate with the vortex street and it starts swimming upstream."}, {"time": 738, "text": "It's one of the best examples ever."}, {"time": 740, "text": "Who do you give credit for that to?"}, {"time": 743, "text": "Is that just evolution

if evolution applied not only to animals, but just the entirety of it somehow drives to efficiency, like nature likes efficiency?"}, {"time": 767, "text": "I don't know if that question even makes any sense."}, {"time": 769, "text": "I understand the question."}, {"time": 771, "text": "That's reasonable."}, {"time": 771, "text": "I mean, do they co evolve?"}, {"time": 774, "text": "Yeah, somehow co, yeah."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Like I don't know if an environment can evolve, but."}, {"time": 780, "text": "I mean, there are experiments that people do, careful experiments that show that animals can adapt to unusual situations and recover efficiency."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So there seems like at least in one direction, I think there is reason to believe that the animal's motor system and probably its mechanics adapt in order to be more efficient."}, {"time": 800, "text": "But efficiency isn't the only goal, of course."}, {"time": 803, "text": "Sometimes it's too easy to

shouldn't draw a line as clearly as we tend to."}, {"time": 827, "text": "But on a robot, we have motors and we have the links of the robot, let's say."}, {"time": 834, "text": "If the motors are

843, "text": "If we have springs and dampers, which our muscles are springs and dampers and tendons."}, {"time": 848, "text": "But then you have something that's doing active work, putting energy in,

mechanics and control interplay somewhere, the divide is around, you know, did you decide to send some commands to your motor or did you just leave the motors off, let them do their work?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Would you say is most of nature on the dynamic side or the control side?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "So like, if you look at biological systems, we're living in a pandemic now, like, do you think a virus is a, do you think it's a dynamic system or is there a lot of control, intelligence?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "I think it's both, but I think we maybe have underestimated how important the dynamics are, right?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "I mean, even our bodies, the mechanics of our bodies, certainly with exercise, they evolve."}, {"time": 906, "text": "But so I actually, I lost a finger in early 2000s and it's my fifth metacarpal."}, {"time": 914, "text": "And it turns out you use that a lot in ways you don't expect when you're opening jars, even when I'm just walking around, if I bump it on something, there's a bone there that was used to taking contact."}, {"time": 926, "text": "My fourth metacarpal wasn't used to taking contact, it used to hurt, it still does a little bit."}, {"time": 931, "text": "But actually my bone has remodeled, right?"}, {"time": 934, "text": "Over a couple of years, the geometry, the mechanics of that bone changed to address the new circumstances."}, {"time": 944, "text": "So the idea that somehow it's only our brain that's adapting or evolving is not right."}, {"time": 950, "text": "Maybe sticking on evolution for a bit, because it's tended to create some interesting things."}, {"time": 956, "text": "Bipedal walking, why the heck did evolution give us, I think we're, are we the only mammals that walk on two feet?"}, {"time":

reason the evolution made us walk on two feet is because there's an advantage to being able to carry food back to the tribe or something like that."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So like you can carry, it's kind of this communal, cooperative thing, so like to carry stuff back to a place of shelter and so on to share with others."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Do you understand at all the value of walking on two feet from both a robotics and a human perspective?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Yeah, there are some great books written about evolution of, walking evolution of the human body."},

"I mean, I think a lot of what dominated our evolution probably was not the things that worked well sort of in the steady state, you know, when things are good, but for instance, people talk about what we should eat now because our ancestors were meat eaters or whatever."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Oh yeah, I love that, yeah."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "But probably, you know, the reason that one pre Homo sapiens species versus another survived was not because of whether they ate well when there was lots of food."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "But when the ice age came, you know, probably one of them happened to be in the wrong place."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "One of them happened to forage a food that was okay even when the glaciers came or something like that, I mean."}, {"time": 1078,

little."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "So yeah, just like you said, it seems like, if you study history, it seems like history turns on like these little events that otherwise would seem meaningless, but in a grant, like when you, in retrospect, were turning points."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "There's probably an even larger community of people, including my mom, who says it's deeply unhealthy, it's wrong, but I just feel good doing it."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "But you're right, these evolutionary arguments can be flawed, but is there anything interesting to pull out for?"}, {"time": 1157,

the point nicely that probably it was a few random events that, yes, maybe it was someone getting hit by a rock, as you say."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "That said, do you think, I don't know how to ask this question or how to talk about this, but there's something elegant and beautiful about moving on two feet, obviously biased because I'm human, but from a robotics perspective, too, you work with robots on two feet, is it all useful to build robots that are on two feet as opposed to four?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Is there something useful about it?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I think the most, I mean, the reason I spent a long time working on bipedal walking was because it was hard and it challenged control theory in ways that I thought were important."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "I wouldn't have ever tried to convince you that you should start a company around bipeds or something like this."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "There are people that make pretty compelling arguments."},

good way to go."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "There are places that a biped can go that would be hard for other form factors to go, even natural places, but at some point in the long run, we'll be

conference called the Dynamic Walking Conference where it brings together both the biomechanics community and the walking robots community."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And so I had been going to this

people read Born to Run in the first, right?"}, {"time": 1314, "text": "The other thing I had going for me is actually that I wasn't a runner before, and I learned to run after I had learned about barefoot running, or I mean, started running longer distances."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "So I didn't have to unlearn."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And I'm definitely, I'm a big fan of it for me, but

makes sense for me."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "It's all about the longterm game, right?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "So I think it's just too easy to run 10 miles, feel pretty good, and then you get home at night and you realize my knees hurt."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "I did something wrong, right?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "If you take your shoes off, then if you hit hard with your foot at all, then it hurts."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "You don't like run 10 miles and then realize you've done some damage."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "You have immediate feedback telling you that you've done something that's maybe suboptimal, and you change your gait."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I mean, it's even subconscious."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "If I, right now, having run many miles barefoot, if I put a shoe on, my gait changes in a way that I think is not as good."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "So it makes me land softer."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And I think my goals for running are to do it for as long as I can into old age, not to win any races."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And so for me, this is a way to protect myself."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "Yeah, I think, first of all, I've tried running barefoot many years ago, probably the other way, just reading Born to Run."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "But just to understand, because I felt like I couldn't put in the miles that I wanted to."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And it feels like running for me, and I think for a lot of people, was one of those activities that we do often and we never really try to learn to do correctly."},

deeply studied how to properly brush my teeth, right?"}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Or wash, as now with the pandemic, or how to properly wash our hands."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "We do it every day, but we haven't really studied, like, am I doing this correctly?"}, {"time": 1455, "text": "But running felt like one of those things, it was absurd not to study how to do correctly, because it's the source of so much pain and suffering."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Like, I hate running, but I do it."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "I do it because I hate it, but I feel good afterwards."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "But I think it feels like you need to learn how to do it properly."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So that's where barefoot running came in, and then I quickly realized that my gait was completely wrong."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "I was taking huge steps, and landing hard on the heel, all those elements."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And so, yeah, from that I actually learned to take really small steps, look."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "I already forgot the number, but I feel like it was 180 a minute or something like that."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And I remember I actually just took songs that are 180 beats per minute, and then like tried to run at that beat, and just to teach myself."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "It took a long time, and I feel like after a while, you learn to run, you adjust properly, without going all the way to barefoot."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "But I feel like barefoot is the legit way to do it."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "I mean, I think a lot of people would be really curious about it."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Can you, if they're interested in trying, what would you, how would you recommend they start, or try, or explore?"}, {"time": 1531, "text": "That's the biggest thing people do, is they are excellent runners, and they're used to running long distances, or running fast, and they take their shoes off, and they hurt themselves instantly trying to do something that they were used to doing."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "I think I lucked out in the sense that I couldn't run very far when I first started trying."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "And I run with minimal shoes too."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "I mean, I will bring along a pair of, actually, like aqua socks or something like this, I can just slip on, or running sandals, I've tried all of them."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "What's the difference between a minimal shoe and nothing at all?"}, {"time": 1563, "text": "What's, like, feeling wise, what does it feel like?"}, {"time": 1567, "text": "There is a, I mean, I notice my gait changing, right?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "So, I mean, your foot has as many muscles and sensors as your hand does, right?"}, {"time": 1577,

like this."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "Now, you have less protection too, so."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Rocks and stuff."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "I mean, yeah, so I think people who are afraid of barefoot running are worried about getting cuts or stepping on rocks."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "First of all, even if that was a concern, I think those are all, like, very short term."}, {"time":

the short term for the long term anytime."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "But even then, you know, and this, again, to my wife's chagrin, your feet get tough, right?"}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And, yeah, I can run over almost anything now."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "I mean, what, can you talk about, is there, like, is there tips or tricks that you have, suggestions about, like, if I wanted to try it?"},

about it."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "I just want to do my part to try to steer that rigorous thinking."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "So there's like two questions I wanna ask."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Do you have sort of a good example of rigorous thinking where it's easy to get lazy and not do the rigorous thinking?"}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And the other question I have is like, do you have advice of how to practice rigorous thinking in all the computer science disciplines that we've mentioned?"}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there are times where problems that can be solved with well known mature methods could also be solved with a deep learning approach."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And there's an argument that you must use learning even for the parts we already think we know, because if the human has touched it, then you've biased the system and you've suddenly put a bottleneck in there that is your own mental model."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "But something like converting a matrix, I think we know how to do that pretty well, even if it's a pretty big matrix, and we understand that pretty well."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "And you could train a deep network to do it, but you shouldn't probably."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "So in that sense, rigorous thinking is understanding the scope and the limitations of the methods that we have, like how to use the tools of mathematics properly."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Yeah, I think taking a class on analysis is all I'm sort of arguing is to take a chance to stop and force yourself to think rigorously about even the rational numbers or something."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "It doesn't have to be the end all problem."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "But that exercise of clear thinking, I think goes a long way, and I just wanna make sure we keep preaching it."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "We don't lose it."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "But do you think when you're doing rigorous thinking or maybe trying to write down equations or sort of explicitly formally describe a system, do you think we naturally simplify things too much?"}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Is that a danger you run into?"}, {"time": 2453, "text": "Like in order to be able to understand something about the system mathematically, we make it too much of a toy example."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "But I think that's the good stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "That's how you understand the fundamentals?"}, {"time": 2467, "text": "I think maybe even that's a key to intelligence or something, but I mean, okay, what if Newton and Galileo had deep learning?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And they had done a bunch of experiments and they told the world, here's your weights of your neural network."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "We've solved the problem."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "Where would we be today?"}, {"time": 2485, "text": "I don't think we'd be as far as we are."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "There's something to be said about having the simplest explanation for a phenomenon."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "So I don't doubt that we can train neural networks to predict even physical F equals MA type equations."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "But I maybe, I want another Newton to come along because I think there's more to do in terms of coming up with the simple models for more complicated tasks."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "Yeah, let's not offend AI systems from 50 years from now that are listening to this that are probably better at, might be better coming up with F equals MA equations themselves."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "So sorry, I actually think learning is probably a route to achieving this, but the representation matters, right?"}, {"time": 2541, "text": "And I think having a function that takes my inputs to outputs that is arbitrarily complex may not be the end goal."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "I think there's still the most simple or parsimonious explanation for the data."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "Simple doesn't mean low dimensional."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "That's one thing I think that we've, a lesson that we've learned."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "So a standard way to do model reduction or system identification and controls is the typical formulation is that you try to find the minimal state dimension realization of a system that hits some error bounds or something like that."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And that's maybe not, I think we're learning that state dimension is not the right metric."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "But for me, I think a lot about contact, the mechanics of contact, if a robot hand is picking up an object or something."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "And when I write down the equations of motion for that, they look incredibly complex, not because, actually not so much because of the dynamics of the hand when it's moving, but it's just the interactions and when they turn on and off, right?"}, {"time": 2610, "text": "So having a high dimensional, but simple description of what's happening out here is fine."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "But if when I actually start touching, if I write down a different dynamical system for every polygon on my robot hand and every polygon on the object, whether it's in contact or not, with all the combinatorics that explodes there, then that's too complex."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "So I need to somehow summarize that with a more intuitive physics way of thinking."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And yeah, I'm very optimistic that machine learning will get us there."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "First of all, I mean, I'll probably do it in the introduction, but you're one of the great robotics people at MIT."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "You're a professor at MIT."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "You've teach him a lot of amazing courses."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "You run a large group and you have a important history for MIT, I think, as being a part of the DARPA Robotics Challenge."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Can you maybe first say, what is the DARPA Robotics Challenge and then tell your story around it, your journey with it?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So the DARPA Robotics Challenge, it came on the tails of the DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge, which were the challenges that brought us, put a spotlight on self driving cars."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "Gil Pratt was at DARPA and pitched a new challenge that involved disaster response."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "It didn't explicitly require humanoids, although humanoids came into the picture."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "This happened shortly after the Fukushima disaster in Japan and our challenge was motivated roughly by that because that was a case where if we had had robots that were ready to be sent in, there's a chance that we could have averted disaster."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And certainly after the, in the disaster response, there were times we would have loved to have sent robots in."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So in practice, what we ended up with was a grand challenge, a DARPA Robotics Challenge, where Boston Dynamics was to make humanoid robots."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "People like me and the amazing team at MIT were competing first in a simulation challenge to try to be one of the ones that wins the right to work on one of the Boston Dynamics humanoids in order to compete in the final challenge, which was a physical challenge."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And at that point, it was already, so it was decided as humanoid robots early on."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "There were two tracks."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "You could enter as a hardware team where you brought your own robot, or you could enter through the virtual robotics challenge as a software team that would try to win the right to use one of the Boston Dynamics robots."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "Sure, called Atlas."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Atlas."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "Humanoid robots."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Yeah, it was a 400 pound Marvel, but a pretty big, scary looking robot."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "Expensive too."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "Expensive, yeah."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Okay, so I mean, how did you feel at the prospect of this kind of challenge?"}, {"time": 2804, "text": "I mean, it seems autonomous vehicles, yeah, I guess that sounds hard, but not really from a robotics perspective."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "It's like, didn't they do it in the 80s is the kind of feeling I would have, like when you first look at the problem, it's on wheels, but like humanoid robots, that sounds really hard."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So what are your, psychologically speaking, what were you feeling, excited, scared?"}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Why the heck did you get yourself involved in this kind of messy challenge?"}, {"time": 2868, "text": "The challenge could have really highlighted perception and autonomous planning, or it ended up that locomoting over complex terrain played a pretty big role in the competition."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So... And the degree of autonomy wasn't clear."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "The degree of autonomy was always a central part of the discussion."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "So what wasn't clear was how we would be able, how far we'd be able to get with it."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "So the idea was always that you want semi autonomy, that you want the robot to have enough compute that you can have a degraded network link to a human."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And so the same way we had degraded networks at many natural disasters, you'd send your robot in, you'd be able to get a few bits back and forth, but you don't get to have enough potentially to fully operate the robot in every joint of the robot."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So, and then the question was, and the gamesmanship of the organizers was to figure out what we're capable of, push us as far as we could, so that it would differentiate the teams that put more autonomy on the robot and had a few clicks and just said, go there, do this, go there, do this, versus someone who's picking every footstep or something like that."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "So what were some memories, painful, triumphant from the experience?"}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Like what was that journey?"}, {"time": 2955, "text": "Maybe if you can dig in a little deeper, maybe even on the technical side, on the team side, that whole process of, from the early idea stages to actually competing."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "I mean, this was a defining experience for me."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "It came at the right time for me in my career."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "I had gotten tenure before I was due a sabbatical, and most people do something relaxing and restorative for a sabbatical."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "So you got tenure before this?"}, {"time": 2986, "text": "It was a good time for me."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "We had a bunch of algorithms that we were very happy with."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "We wanted to see how far we could push them, and this was a chance to really test our mettle to do more proper software engineering."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "So the team, we all just worked our butts off."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "We were in that lab almost all the time."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "Okay, so there were some, of course, high highs and low lows throughout that."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "Anytime you're not sleeping and devoting your life to a 400 pound humanoid."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "I remember actually one funny moment where we're all super tired, and so Atlas had to walk across cinder blocks."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "That was one of the obstacles."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "And I remember Atlas was powered down and hanging limp on its harness, and the humans were there picking up and laying the brick down so that the robot could walk over it."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "And I thought, what is wrong with this?"}, {"time": 3038, "text": "We've got a robot just watching us do all the manual labor so that it can take its little stroll across the train."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "But I mean, even the virtual robotics challenge was super nerve wracking and dramatic."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "I remember, so we were using Gazebo as a simulator on the cloud, and there was all these interesting challenges."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "I think the investment that OSR FC, whatever they were called at that time, Brian Gerkey's team at Open Source Robotics, they were pushing on the capabilities of Gazebo in order to scale it to the complexity of these challenges."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "So, you know, up to the virtual competition."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "So the virtual competition was, you will sign on at a certain time and we'll have a network connection to another machine on the cloud that is running the simulator of your robot."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And your controller will run on this computer and the physics will run on the other and you have to connect."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Now, the physics, they wanted it to run at real time rates because there was an element of human interaction."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And humans, if you do want to teleop, it works way better if it's at frame rate."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "But it was very hard to simulate these complex scenes at real time rate."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "So right up to like days before the competition, the simulator wasn't quite at real time rate."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And that was great for me because my controller was solving a pretty big optimization problem and it wasn't quite at real time rate."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "So I was fine."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "I was keeping up with the simulator."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "We were both running at about 0.7."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "And I remember getting this email."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And by the way, the perception folks on our team hated that they knew that if my controller was too slow, the robot was gonna fall down."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "And no matter how good their perception system was, if I can't make my controller fast."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "Anyways, we get this email like three days before the virtual competition."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "It's for all the marbles."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "We're gonna either get a humanoid robot or we're not."}, {"time": 3164,

are we gonna do here?"}, {"time": 3174, "text": "So that came in late at night for me."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "A few days ahead."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "I went over, it happened at Frank

{"time": 3208, "text": "It was terrifying."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "So there's a really hard optimization problem that you're constantly solving."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "You didn't make the optimization problem simpler?"}, {"time": 3216, "text": "You wrote a new solver?"}, {"time": 3218, "text": "So, I mean, your observation is almost spot on."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "What we did was what everybody, I mean, people know how to do this, but we had not yet done this idea of warm starting."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "So we are solving a big optimization problem at every time step."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But if you're running fast enough, the optimization problem you're solving on the last time step is pretty similar to the optimization you're gonna solve with the next."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "We had course had told our commercial solver to use warm starting, but even the interface to that commercial solver was causing us these delays."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "So what we did was we basically wrote, we called it fast QP at the time."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "We wrote a very lightweight, very fast layer, which would basically check if nearby solutions to the quadratic program were, which were very easily checked, could stabilize the robot."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And if they couldn't, we would fall back to the solver."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "You couldn't really test this well, right?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "I mean, so we always knew that if we fell back to, if we, it got to the point where if for some reason things slowed down and we fell back to the original solver, the robot would actually literally fall down."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "So it was a harrowing sort of edge we were, ledge we were sort of on."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "But I mean, it actually, like the 400 pound human could come crashing to the ground if your solver's not fast enough."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "But you know, we had lots of good experiences."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "So can I ask you a weird question I get about idea of hard work?"}, {"time": 3309, "text": "So actually people, like students of yours that I've interacted with and just, and robotics people in general, but they have moments, at moments have worked harder than most people I know in terms of, if you look at different disciplines of how hard people work."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "But they're also like the happiest."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "Like, just like, I don't know."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "It's the same thing with like running."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "People that push themselves to like the limit, they also seem to be like the most like full of life somehow."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And I get often criticized like, you're not getting enough

like, I'm doing what I love."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "I'm passionate about it."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "I feel like it's, it's invigorating."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "I actually think, I don't think the lack of sleep is what hurts you."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "I think what hurts you is stress and lack of doing things that you're passionate about."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "But in this world, yeah, I mean, can you comment about why the heck robotics people are willing to push themselves to that degree?"}, {"time": 3386, "text": "Is there value in that?"}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And why are they so happy?"}, {"time": 3390, "text": "I think, I think you got it right."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "I mean, I think the causality is not that we work hard."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "And I think other disciplines work very hard too, but it's, I don't think it's that we work hard and therefore we are happy."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "I think we found something that we're truly passionate about."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "It makes us very happy."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "And then we get a little involved with it and spend a lot of time on it."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "What a luxury to have something that you wanna spend all your time on, right?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "We could talk about this for many hours, but maybe if we could pick, is there something on the technical side on the approach that you took that's interesting that turned out to be a terrible failure or a success that you carry into your work today about all the different ideas that were involved in making, whether in the simulation or in the real world, making this semi autonomous system work?"}, {"time": 3445, "text": "I mean, it really did teach me something fundamental about what it's gonna take to get robustness out of a system of this complexity."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "I would say the DARPA challenge really was foundational in my thinking."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "I think the autonomous driving community thinks about this."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "I think lots of people thinking about safety critical systems that might have machine learning in the loop are thinking about these questions."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "For me, the DARPA challenge was the moment where I realized we've spent every waking minute running this robot."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "And again, for the physical competition, days before the competition, we saw the robot fall down in a way it had never fallen down before."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "I thought, how could we have found that?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "We only have one robot, it's running almost all the time."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "We just didn't have enough hours in the day to test that robot."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "Something has to change, right?"}, {"time": 3499, "text": "And then I think that, I mean, I would say that the team that won was, from KAIST, was the team that had two robots and was able to do not only incredible engineering, just absolutely top rate engineering, but also they were able to test at a rate and discipline that we didn't keep up with."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "What does testing look like?"}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Like, what's a loop of tests?"}, {"time": 3525, "text": "Like from start to finish, what is a loop of testing?"}, {"time": 3528, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think there's a whole philosophy to testing."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "There's the unit tests, and you can do that on a hardware, you can do that in a small piece of code."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "You write one function, you should write a test that checks that function's input and outputs."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "You should also write an integration test at the other extreme of running the whole system together, where they try to turn on all of the different functions that you think are correct."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "It's much harder to write the specifications for a system level test, especially if that system is as complicated as a humanoid robot."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "But the philosophy is sort of the same."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "On the real robot, it's no different, but on a real robot, it's impossible to run the same experiment twice."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "So if you see a failure, you hope you caught something in the logs that tell you what happened, but you'd probably never be able to run exactly that experiment again."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "And right now, I think our philosophy is just, basically Monte Carlo estimation, is just run as many experiments as we can, maybe try to set up the environment to make the things we are worried about happen as often as possible."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "But really we're relying on somewhat random search in order to test."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "Maybe that's all we'll ever be able to, but I think, you know, cause there's an argument that the things that'll get you are the things that are really nuanced in the world."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "And there'd be very hard to, for instance, put back in a simulation."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "Yeah, I guess the edge cases."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "What was the hardest thing?"}, {"time": 3621, "text": "Like, so you said walking over rough terrain, like just taking footsteps."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "I mean, people, it's so dramatic and painful in a certain kind of way to watch these videos from the DRC of robots falling."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "It's just so heartbreaking."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Maybe it's because for me at least, we anthropomorphize the robot."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "Of course, it's also funny for some reason, like humans falling is funny for, I don't, it's some dark reason."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "I'm not sure why it is so, but it's also like tragic and painful."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "And so speaking of which, I mean, what made the robots fall and fail in your view?"}, {"time": 3665, "text": "So I can tell you exactly what happened on our, we, I contributed one of those."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "Our team contributed one of those spectacular falls."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "Every one of those falls has a complicated story."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "I mean, at one time, the power effectively went out on the robot because it had been sitting at the door waiting for a green light to be able to proceed and its batteries, you know, and therefore it just fell backwards and smashed its head against the ground."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "And it was hilarious, but it wasn't because of bad software, right?"}, {"time": 3694, "text": "But for ours, so the hardest part of the challenge, the hardest task in my view was getting out of the Polaris."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "It was actually relatively easy to drive the Polaris."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "Can you tell the story?"}, {"time": 3705, "text": "The story of the car."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "People should watch this video."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "I mean, the thing you've come up with is just brilliant, but anyway, sorry, what's... Yeah, we kind of joke."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "We call it the big robot, little car problem because somehow the race organizers decided to give us a 400 pound humanoid."}, {"time": 3725, "text": "And then they also provided the vehicle, which was a little Polaris."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "And the robot didn't really fit in the car."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So you couldn't drive the car with your feet under the steering column."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "We actually had to straddle the main column of the, and have basically one foot in the passenger seat, one foot in the driver's seat, and then drive with our left hand."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "But the hard part was we had to then park the car, get out of the car."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "It didn't have a door, that was okay."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "But it's just getting up from crouched, from sitting, when you're in this very constrained environment."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "First of all, I remember after watching those videos, I was much more cognizant of how hard it is for me to get in and out of the car, and out of the car, especially."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "It's actually a really difficult control problem."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "I'm very cognizant of it when I'm like injured for whatever reason."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "Oh, that's really hard."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "So how did you approach this problem?"}, {"time": 3783, "text": "So we had, you think of NASA's operations, and they have these checklists, prelaunched checklists and the like."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "We weren't far off from that."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "We had this big checklist."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "And on the first day of the competition, we were running down our checklist."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "And one of the things we had to do, we had to turn off the controller, the piece of software that was running that would drive the left foot of the robot in order to accelerate on the gas."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "And then we turned on our balancing controller."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And the nerves, jitters of the first day of the competition, someone forgot to check that box and turn that controller off."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "So we used a lot of motion planning to figure out a sort of configuration of the robot that we could get up and over."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "We relied heavily on our balancing controller."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "And basically, when the robot was in one of its most precarious sort of configurations, trying to sneak its big leg out of the side, the other controller that thought it was still driving told its left foot to go like this."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "And that wasn't good."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "But it turned disastrous for us because what happened was a little bit of push here."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "Actually, we have videos of us running into the robot with a 10 foot pole and it kind of will recover."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "But this is a case where there's no space to recover."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "So a lot of our secondary balancing mechanisms about like take a step to recover, they were all disabled because we were in the car and there was no place to step."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "So we were relying on our just lowest level reflexes."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "And even then, I think just hitting the foot on the seat, on the floor, we probably could have recovered from it."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "But the thing that was bad that happened is when we did that and we jostled a little bit, the tailbone of our robot was only a little off the seat, it hit the seat."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And the other foot came off the ground just a little bit."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "And nothing in our plans had ever told us what to do if your butt's on the seat and your feet are in the air."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "Feet in the air."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "And then the thing is once you get off the script, things can go very wrong because even our state estimation, our system that was trying to collect all the data from the sensors and understand what's happening with the robot, it didn't know about this situation."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "So it was predicting things that were just wrong."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "And then we did a violent shake and fell off in our face first out of the robot."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "But like into the destination."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "That's true, we fell in, we got our point for egress."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "But so is there any hope for, that's interesting, is there any hope for Atlas to be able to do something when it's just on its butt and feet in the air?"}, {"time": 3947, "text": "So you can, what do you?"}, {"time": 3948, "text": "No, so that is one of the big challenges."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "And I think it's still true, you know, Boston Dynamics and Antimal and there's this incredible work on legged robots happening around the world."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "Most of them still are very good at the case where you're making contact with the world at your feet."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And they have typically point feet relatively, they have balls on their feet, for instance."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "If those robots get in a situation where the elbow hits the wall or something like this, that's a pretty different situation."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "Now they have layers of mechanisms that will make, I think the more mature solutions have ways in which the controller won't do stupid things."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "But a human, for instance, is able to leverage incidental contact in order to accomplish a goal."}, {"time": 3996, "text": "In fact, I might, if you push me, I might actually put my hand out and make a new brand new contact."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "The feet of the robot are doing this on quadrupeds, but we mostly in robotics are afraid of contact on the rest of our body, which is crazy."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "There's this whole field of motion planning, collision free motion planning."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "And we write very complex algorithms so that the robot can dance around and make sure it doesn't touch the world."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "So people are just afraid of contact because contact the scene is a difficult."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "It's still a difficult control problem and sensing problem."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "Now you're a serious person, I'm a little bit of an idiot and I'm going to ask you some dumb questions."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "So I do martial arts."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "So like jiu jitsu, I wrestled my whole life."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "So let me ask the question, like whenever people learn that I do any kind of AI or like I mentioned robots and things like that, they say, when are we going to have robots that can win in a wrestling match or in a fight against a human?"}, {"time": 4069, "text": "So we just mentioned sitting on your butt, if you're in the air, that's a common position."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "Jiu jitsu, when you're on the ground, you're a down opponent."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "Like how difficult do you think is the problem?"}, {"time": 4083, "text": "And when will we have a robot that can defeat a human in a wrestling match?"}, {"time": 4088, "text": "And we're talking about a lot, like, I don't know if you're familiar with wrestling, but essentially."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "Not very."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "It's basically the art of contact."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "It's like, it's because you're picking contact points and then using like leverage like to off balance to trick people, like you make them feel like you're doing one thing and then they change their balance and then you switch what you're doing and then results in a throw or whatever."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "So like, it's basically the art of multiple contacts."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "Awesome, that's a nice description of it."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So there's also an opponent in there, right?"}, {"time": 4133, "text": "So if."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Very dynamic."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "Right, if you are wrestling a human and are in a game theoretic situation with a human, that's still hard, but just to speak to the, you know, quickly reasoning about contact part of it, for instance."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "Yeah, maybe even throwing the game theory out of it, almost like, yeah, almost like a non dynamic opponent."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Right, there's reasons to be optimistic, but I think our best understanding of those problems are still pretty hard."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "I have been increasingly focused on manipulation, partly where that's a case where the contact has to be much more rich."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "And there are some really impressive examples of deep learning policies, controllers that can appear to do good things through contact."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "We've even got new examples of, you know, deep learning models of predicting what's gonna happen to objects as they go through contact."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "But I think the challenge you just offered there still eludes us, right?"}, {"time": 4201, "text": "The ability to make a decision based on those models quickly."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "You know, I have to think though, it's hard for humans too, when you get that complicated."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "I think probably you had maybe a slow motion version of where you learned the basic skills and you've probably gotten better at it and there's much more subtle to you."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "But it might still be hard to actually, you know, really on the fly take a, you know, model of your humanoid and figure out how to plan the optimal sequence."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "That might be a problem we never solve."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "Well, the, I mean, one of the most amazing things to me about the, we can talk about martial arts."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "We could also talk about dancing."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "Doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Too human, I think it's the most interesting study of contact."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "It's not even the dynamic element of it."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "It's the, like when you get good at it, it's so effortless."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "Like I can just, I'm very cognizant of the entirety of the learning process being essentially like learning how to move my body in a way that I could throw very large weights around effortlessly, like, and I can feel the learning."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "Like I'm a huge believer in drilling of techniques and you can just like feel your, I don't, you're not feeling, you're feeling, sorry, you're learning it intellectually a little bit, but a lot of it is the body learning it somehow, like instinctually and whatever that learning is, that's really, I'm not even sure if that's equivalent to like a deep learning, learning a controller."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "I think it's something more, it feels like there's a lot of distributed learning going on."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Yeah, I think there's hierarchy and composition probably in the systems that we don't capture very well yet."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "You have layers of control systems."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "You have reflexes at the bottom layer and you have a system that's capable of planning a vacation to some distant country, which is probably, you probably don't have a controller, a policy for every possible destination you'll ever pick."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "But there's something magical in the in between and how do you go from these low level feedback loops to something that feels like a pretty complex set of outcomes."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "You know, my guess is, I think there's evidence that you can plan at some of these levels, right?"}, {"time": 4357, "text": "So Josh Tenenbaum just showed it in his talk the other day."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "He's got a game he likes to talk about."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "I think he calls it the pick three game or something, where he puts a bunch of clutter down in front of a person and he says, okay, pick three objects."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And it might be a telephone or a shoe or a Kleenex box or whatever."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And apparently you pick three items and then you pick, he says, okay, pick the first one up with your right hand, the second one up with your left hand."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "Now using those objects, now as tools, pick up the third object."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Right, so that's down at the level of physics and mechanics and contact mechanics that I think we do learning or we do have policies for, we do control for, almost feedback, but somehow we're able to still, I mean, I've never picked up a telephone with a shoe and a water bottle before."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "And somehow, and it takes me a little longer to do that the first time, but most of the time we can sort of figure that out."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "So yeah, I think the amazing thing is this ability to be flexible with our models, plan when we need to use our well oiled controllers when we don't, when we're in familiar territory."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "Having models, I think the other thing you just said was something about, I think your awareness of what's happening is even changing as you improve your expertise, right?"}, {"time": 4442, "text": "So maybe you have a very approximate model of the mechanics to begin with."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And as you gain expertise, you get a more refined version of that model."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "You're aware of muscles or balance components that you just weren't even aware of before."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "So how do you scaffold that?"}, {"time": 4461, "text": "Yeah, plus the fear of injury, the ambition of goals, of excelling, and fear of mortality."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "Let's see, what else is in there?"}, {"time": 4473, "text": "As the motivations, overinflated ego in the beginning, and then a crash of confidence in the middle."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "All of those seem to be essential for the learning process."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "And if all that's good, then you're probably optimizing energy efficiency."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "Yeah, right, so we have to get that right."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "So there was this idea that you would have robots play soccer better than human players by 2050."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "That was the goal."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "Basically, it was the goal to beat world champion team, to become a world cup, beat like a world cup level team."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "So are we gonna see that first?"}, {"time": 4515, "text": "Or a robot, if you're familiar, there's an organization called UFC for mixed martial arts."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "Are we gonna see a world cup championship soccer team that have robots, or a UFC champion mixed martial artist as a robot?"}, {"time": 4533, "text": "I mean, it's very hard to say one thing is harder, some problem is harder than the other."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "What probably matters is who started the organization that, I mean, I think RoboCup has a pretty serious following, and there is a history now of people playing that game, learning about that game, building robots to play that game, building increasingly more human robots."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "It's got momentum."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "So if you want to have mixed martial arts compete, you better start your organization now, right?"}, {"time": 4565, "text": "I think almost independent of which problem is technically harder, because they're both hard and they're both different."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "I mean, those videos are just hilarious, like especially the humanoid robots trying to play soccer."}, {"time": 4581, "text":

mechanical work and an unsolved problem."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "It's an unsolved problem, yeah."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "So from a perspective of control and mechanics, dynamics, what is a robot?"}, {"time": 5740, "text": "So there are many different types of robots."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "The control that you need for a Jibo robot, you know, some robot that's sitting on your

different than what you need for a robot that's gonna walk or pick things up with its hands, right?"}, {"time": 5764, "text": "My passion has always been for the places where you're interacting more,

5781, "text": "I think contact is one thing that differentiates them from many of the control problems we've solved classically, right, like modern control grew up stabilizing fighter jets that were passively unstable, and there's like amazing success stories from control all over the place."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "Power grid, I mean, there's all kinds of, it's everywhere that we don't even

in the command I send to my actuator, then the path that the robot will take tends to change only by a small amount."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "And there's a feedback mechanism here."}, {"time": 5838,

instance, I can use more linear algebra tools to study systems like that, generalizations of linear algebra to these smooth systems."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "What is contact?"}, {"time": 5857, "text": "The robot has something very discontinuous that happens when it makes or breaks, when it starts touching the world."}, {"time": 5865, "text": "And even the way it touches or the order of contacts can change the outcome in potentially unpredictable ways."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "Not unpredictable, but complex ways."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "I do think there's a little bit of, a lot of people will say that contact is hard in robotics, even to simulate."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "And I think there's a little bit of a, there's truth to that, but maybe a misunderstanding around that."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "So what is limiting is that when we think about our robots and we write our simulators, we often make an assumption that objects are rigid."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "And when it comes down, that their mass moves all, stays in a constant position relative to each other itself."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "And that leads to some paradoxes when you go to try to talk about rigid body mechanics and contact."}, {"time": 5923, "text": "And so for instance, if I have a three legged stool with just imagine it comes to a point at the leg."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "So it's only touching the world at a point."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "If I draw my physics, my high school physics diagram of the system, then there's a couple of things that I'm given by elementary physics."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "I know if the system, if the table is at rest, if it's not moving, zero velocities, that means that the normal force, all the forces are in balance."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "So the force of gravity is being countered by the forces that the ground is pushing on my table legs."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "I also know since it's not rotating that the moments have to balance."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And since it's a three dimensional table, it could fall in any direction."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "It actually tells me uniquely what those three normal forces have to be."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "If I have four legs on my table, four legged table and they were perfectly machined to be exactly the right same height and they're set down and the table's not moving, then the basic conservation laws don't tell me, there are many solutions for the forces that the ground could be putting on my legs that would still result in the table not moving."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "Now, the reason that seems fine, I could just pick one."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "But it gets funny now because if you think about friction, what we think about with friction is our standard model says the amount of force that the table will push back if I were to now try to push my table sideways, I guess I have a table here, is proportional to the normal force."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "So if I'm barely touching and I push, I'll slide, but if I'm pushing more and I push, I'll slide less."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "It's called coulomb friction is our standard model."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "Now, if you don't know what the normal force is on the four legs and you push the table, then you don't know what the friction forces are gonna be."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "And so you can't actually tell, the laws just aren't explicit yet about which way the table's gonna go."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "It could veer off to the left, it could veer off to the right, it could go straight."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "So the rigid body assumption of contact leaves us with some paradoxes, which are annoying for writing simulators and for writing controllers."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "We still do that sometimes because soft contact is potentially harder numerically or whatever, and the best simulators do both or do some combination of the two."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "But anyways, because of these kinds of paradoxes, there's all kinds of paradoxes in contact, mostly due to these rigid body assumptions."}, {"time": 6083, "text": "It

are situations absolutely where our laws don't tell us."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "So the standard approach, that's okay."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "I mean, instead of having a differential equation, you end up with a differential inclusion, it's called."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "It's a set valued equation."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "It says that I'm in this configuration, I have these forces applied on me."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "And there's a set of things that could happen, right?"}, {"time": 6123, "text": "And you can...

That's so fascinating."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "Okay, so what do you do?"}, {"time": 6157, "text": "Sorry, I interrupted you."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "What's the hope under so much uncertainty about what's going to happen?"}, {"time": 6166, "text": "I mean, control has an answer for this."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "Robust control is one approach, but roughly you can write controllers which try to still perform the right task despite all the things that could possibly happen."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "The world might want the table to go this way and this way, but if I write a controller that pushes a little bit more and pushes a little bit, I can certainly make the table go in the direction I want."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "It just puts a little bit more of a burden on the control system, right?"}, {"time": 6192, "text": "And this discontinuities do change the control system because the way we write it down right now, every different control configuration, including sticking or sliding or parts of my body that are in contact or not, looks like a different system."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "And I think of them, I reason about them separately or differently and the combinatorics of that blow up, right?"}, {"time": 6218, "text": "So I just don't have enough time to compute all the possible contact configurations of my humanoid."}, {"time": 6225, "text":

contact configuration?"}, {"time": 6260, "text": "What like, just so we can enumerate what are we talking about?"}, {"time": 6266, "text": "How many are there?"}, {"time": 6267, "text": "The simplest example maybe would be, imagine a robot with a flat foot."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And we think about the phases of gait where the heel strikes and then the front toe strikes, and then you can heel up, toe off."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "Those are each different contact configurations."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "I only had two different contacts, but I ended up with four different contact configurations."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "Now, of course, my robot might actually have bumps on it or other things, so it could be much more subtle than that, right?"}, {"time": 6300, "text": "But it's just even with one sort of box interacting with the ground already in the plane has that many, right?"}, {"time": 6307, "text": "And if I was just even a 3D foot, then it probably my left toe might touch just before my right toe and things get subtle."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "Now, if I'm a dexterous hand and I go to talk about just grabbing a water bottle, if I have to enumerate every possible order that my hand came into contact with the bottle, then I'm dead in the water."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "Any approach that we were able to get away with that in walking because we mostly touched the ground within a small number of points, for instance, and we haven't been able to get dexterous hands that way."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "So you've mentioned that people think that contact is really hard and that that's the reason that robotic manipulation is problem is really hard."}, {"time": 6360, "text": "Is there any flaws in that thinking?"}, {"time": 6366, "text": "So I think simulating contact is one aspect."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "I know people often say that we don't, that one of the reasons that we have a limit in robotics is because we do not simulate contact accurately in our simulators."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "And I think that is the extent to which that's true is partly because our simulators, we haven't got mature enough simulators."}, {"time":

people."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "I certainly spent a lot of hours on it myself."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "But what is Drake and what does it take to create a simulation environment for the kind of difficult control problems we're talking about?"}, {"time": 6440, "text": "Right, so Drake is the simulator that I've been working on."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "There are other good simulators out there."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "I don't like to think of Drake as just a simulator because we write our controllers in Drake, we write our perception systems a little bit in Drake, but we write all of our low level control and even planning and optimization."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "So it has optimization capabilities as well?"}, {"time": 6463, "text": "I mean, Drake is three things roughly."}, {"time": 6466, "text": "It's an optimization library, which is sits on, it provides a layer of abstraction in C++ and Python for commercial solvers."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "You can write linear programs, quadratic programs, semi definite programs, sums of squares programs, the ones we've used, mixed integer programs, and it will do the work to curate those and send them to whatever the right solver is for instance, and it provides a level of abstraction."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "If you have any state, for instance, in the system, any variables that are gonna persist, you have to declare them."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "Parameters can be declared and the like, but the advantage of doing that is that you can, if you like, run things all on one process, but you can also do control design against it."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "You can do, I mean, simple things like rewinding and playing back your simulations, for instance, these things, you get some rewards for spending a little bit more upfront cost in describing each system."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And I was inspired to do that because I think the complexity of Atlas, for instance, is just so great."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "And I think, although, I mean, ROS has been an incredible, absolutely huge fan of what it's done for the robotics community, but the ability to rapidly put different pieces together and have a functioning thing is very good."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "But I do think that it's hard to think clearly about a bag of disparate parts, Mr."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "Potato Head kind of software stack."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "And if you can ask a little bit more out of each of those parts, then you can understand the way they work better."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "You can try to verify them and the like, or you can do learning against them."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "And then one of those systems, the last thing, I said the first two things that Drake is, but the last thing is that there is a set of multi body equations, rigid body equations, that is trying to provide a system that simulates physics."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "And we also have renderers and other things, but I think the physics component of Drake is special in the sense that we have done excessive amount of engineering to make sure that we've written the equations correctly."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "Every possible tumbling satellite or spinning top or anything that we could possibly write as a test is tested."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "We are making some, I think, fundamental improvements on the way you simulate contact."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "Just what does it take to simulate contact?"}, {"time": 6647, "text": "I mean, it just seems, I mean, there's something just beautiful to the way you were like explaining contact and you were like tapping your fingers on the table while you're doing it, just."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "Easily, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "Easily, just like, just not even like, it was like helping you think, I guess."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "So you have this like awesome demo of loading or unloading a dishwasher, just picking up a plate, or grasping it like for the first time."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "That's just seems like so difficult."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "What, how do you simulate any of that?"}, {"time": 6693,

learned the value of software engineering and how these, how to bridle complexity."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "I guess that's what I want to somehow fight against and bring some of the clear thinking of controls into these complex systems we're building for robots."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "Shortly after the DARPA Robotics Challenge, Toyota opened a research institute, TRI, Toyota Research

ramp that up right up as a part of my, the end of my sabbatical, I guess."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So TRI has given me, the TRI robotics effort has made this investment in simulation in Drake."},

cases kind of problems in manipulation."}, {"time": 6775, "text": "So for me, this, you know, simulating the dishes, we could actually write a controller."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "If we just cared about picking up dishes in the sink once, we could write a controller without any simulation whatsoever, and we could call it done."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "But we want to understand like, what is the path you take to actually get to a robot that could perform that for any dish in anybody's kitchen with enough confidence that it could be a commercial product, right?"}, {"time": 6806, "text":

6826, "text": "I mean, the DARPA challenge made me realize that that's not something you throw over the fence and hope that somebody will harden it for you, that there are really fundamental challenges in closing that last gap."}, {"time": 6839, "text": "They're doing the validation and the testing."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "I think it might even change the way we have to think about the way we write systems."}, {"time": 6849, "text": "What happens if you have the robot running lots of tests and it screws up, it breaks a dish, right?"}, {"time": 6859, "text": "How do you capture that?"}, {"time": 6859, "text": "I said, you can't run the same simulation or the same experiment twice on a real robot."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "Do we have to be able to bring that one off failure

answers for."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "Like how do you find the corner cases?"}, {"time": 6895, "text": "That's one kind of, is there, do you think that's possible to create a systematized way of discovering corner cases efficiently?"}, {"time": 6905, "text": "In whatever the problem is?"}, {"time": 6907, "text": "Yes, I mean, I think we have to get better at that."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "I mean, control theory has for decades talked about active experiment design."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "So people call it curiosity these days."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "It's roughly this idea of

matters, all of your off board sensors are occluded."}, {"time": 7633, "text": "And really, if you don't have tactile information, then you're blind in an important way."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "So it happens that soft robotics and tactile sensing tend to go hand in hand."}, {"time": 7645, "text": "I think we've kind of talked about it, but you taught a course on underactuated robotics."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "I believe that was the name of it, actually."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "Can you talk about it in that context?"}, {"time": 7657, "text": "What is underactuated robotics?"}, {"time": 7660, "text": "Right, so underactuated robotics is my graduate course."}, {"time": 7663, "text": "It's online mostly now, in the sense that the lectures."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "Several versions of it, I think."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "Right, the YouTube."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "It's really great, I recommend it highly."}, {"time": 7672, "text": "Look on YouTube for the 2020 versions."}, {"time": 7675, "text": "Until March, and then you have to go back to 2019, thanks to COVID."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "No, I've poured my heart into that class."}, {"time": 7684, "text": "And lecture one is basically explaining what the word underactuated means."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "So people are very kind to show up and then maybe have to learn what the title of the course means over the course of the first lecture."}, {"time": 7695, "text": "That first lecture is really good."}, {"time": 7697, "text": "You should watch it."}, {"time": 7699, "text": "It's a strange name, but I thought it captured the essence of what control was good at doing and what control was bad at doing."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So what do I mean by underactuated?"}, {"time": 7711, "text": "So a mechanical system has many degrees of freedom, for instance."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "I think of a joint as a degree of freedom."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "And it has some number of actuators, motors."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "So if you have a robot that's bolted to the table that has five degrees of freedom and five motors, then you have a fully actuated robot."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "If you take away one of those motors, then you have an underactuated robot."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "Now, why on earth?"}, {"time": 7744, "text": "I have a good friend who likes to tease me."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "He said, Ross, if you had more research funding, would you work on fully actuated robots?"}, {"time": 7755, "text": "The world gives us underactuated robots, whether we like it or not."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "I'm a human."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "I'm an underactuated robot, even though I have more muscles than my big degrees of freedom, because I have in some places multiple muscles attached to the same joint."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "But still, there's a really important degree of freedom that I have, which is the location of my center of mass in space, for instance."}, {"time": 7779, "text": "All right, I can jump into the air, and there's no motor that connects my center of mass to the ground in that case."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "So I have to think about the implications of not having control over everything."}, {"time": 7792, "text": "The passive dynamic walkers are the extreme view of that, where you've taken away all the motors, and you have to let physics do the work."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "But it shows up in all of the walking robots, where you have to use some of the actuators to push and pull even the degrees of freedom that you don't have an actuator on."}, {"time": 7809, "text": "That's referring to walking if you're falling forward."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "Is there a way to walk that's fully actuated?"}, {"time": 7816, "text": "So it's a subtle point."}, {"time": 7818, "text": "When you're in contact and you have your feet on the ground, there are still limits to what you can do, right?"}, {"time": 7826, "text": "Unless I have suction cups on my feet, I cannot accelerate my center of mass towards the ground faster than gravity, because I can't get a force pushing me down, right?"}, {"time": 7837, "text": "But I can still do most of the things that I want to."}, {"time": 7839, "text": "So you can get away with basically thinking of the system as fully actuated, unless you suddenly needed to accelerate down super fast."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "But as soon as I take a step, I get into the more nuanced territory, and to get to really dynamic robots, or airplanes or other things, I think you have to embrace the underactuated dynamics."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "Manipulation, people think, is manipulation underactuated?"}, {"time": 7866, "text": "Even if my arm is fully actuated, I have a motor, if my goal is to control the position and orientation of this cup, then I don't have an actuator for that directly."}, {"time": 7879, "text": "So I have to use my actuators over here to control this thing."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "Now it gets even worse, like what if I have to button my shirt, okay?"}, {"time": 7889, "text": "What are the degrees of freedom of my shirt, right?"}, {"time": 7891, "text": "I suddenly, that's a hard question to think about."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "It kind of makes me queasy thinking about my state space control ideas."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "But actually those are the problems that make me so excited about manipulation right now, is that it breaks some of the, it breaks a lot of the foundational control stuff that I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "Is there, what are some interesting insights you could say about trying to solve an underactuated, a control in an underactuated system?"}, {"time": 7922, "text": "So I think the philosophy there is let physics do more of the work."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "The technical approach has been optimization."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "So you typically formulate your decision making for control as an optimization problem."}, {"time": 7937, "text": "And you use the language of optimal control and sometimes often numerical optimal control in order to make those decisions and balance, these complicated equations of, and in order to control, you don't have to use optimal control to do underactuated systems, but that has been the technical approach that has borne the most fruit in our, at least in our line of work."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "And there's some, so in underactuated systems, when you say let physics do some of the work, so there's a kind of feedback loop that observes the state that the physics brought you to."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "So like you've, there's a perception there, there's a feedback somehow."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "Do you ever loop in like complicated perception systems into this whole picture?"}, {"time": 7986, "text": "Right, right around the time of the DARPA challenge, we had a complicated perception system in the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "We also started to embrace perception for our flying vehicles at the time."}, {"time": 7997, "text": "We had a really good project on trying to make airplanes fly at high speeds through forests."}, {"time": 8004, "text": "Sirtash Karaman was on that project and we had, it was a really fun team to work on."}, {"time": 8010, "text": "He's carried it farther, much farther forward since then."}, {"time": 8014, "text": "And that's using cameras for perception?"}, {"time": 8015, "text": "So that was using cameras."}, {"time": 8017, "text": "That was, at the time we felt like LIDAR was too heavy and too power heavy to be carried on a light UAV, and we were using cameras."}, {"time": 8029, "text": "And that was a big part of it was just how do you do even stereo matching at a fast enough rate with a small camera, small onboard compute."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "Since then we have now, so the deep learning revolution unquestionably changed what we can do with perception for robotics and control."}, {"time": 8049, "text": "So in manipulation, we can address, we can use perception in I think a much deeper way."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "And we get into not only, I think the first use of it naturally would be to ask your deep learning system to look at the cameras and produce the state, which is like the pose of my thing, for instance."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "But I think we've quickly found out that that's not always the right thing to do."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "Because what's the state of my shirt?"}, {"time": 8078, "text": "Imagine, I've always, Very noisy, you mean, or?"}, {"time": 8081, "text": "It's, if the first step of me trying to button my shirt is estimate the full state of my shirt, including like what's happening in the back here, whatever, whatever."}, {"time": 8091, "text": "That's just not the right specification."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "There are aspects of the state that are very important to the task."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "There are many that are unobservable and not important to the task."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "So you really need, it begs new questions about state representation."}, {"time": 8111, "text": "Another example that we've been playing with in lab has been just the idea of chopping onions, okay?"}, {"time": 8117, "text": "Or carrots, turns out to be better."}, {"time": 8120, "text": "So onions stink up the lab."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "And they're hard to see in a camera."}, {"time": 8126, "text": "But so, Details matter, yeah."}, {"time": 8128, "text": "Details matter, you know?"}, {"time": 8130, "text": "So if I'm moving around a particular object, right?"}, {"time": 8135, "text": "Then I think about, oh, it's got a position or an orientation in space."}, {"time": 8138, "text": "That's the description I want."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "Now, when I'm chopping an onion, okay?"}, {"time": 8142, "text": "Like the first chop comes down."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "I have now a hundred pieces of onion."}, {"time": 8148, "text": "Does my control system really need to understand the position and orientation and even the shape of the hundred pieces of onion in order to make a decision?"}, {"time": 8156, "text": "Probably not, you know?"}, {"time": 8156, "text": "And if I keep going, I'm just getting, more and more is my state space getting bigger as I cut?"}, {"time": 8164, "text": "It's not right."}, {"time": 8166, "text": "So somehow there's a, I think there's a richer idea of state."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "It's not the state that is given to us by Lagrangian mechanics."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "There is a proper Lagrangian state of the system, but the relevant state for this is some latent state is what we call it in machine learning."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "But, you know, there's some different state representation."}, {"time": 8192, "text": "Some compressed representation, some."}, {"time": 8195, "text": "And that's what I worry about saying compressed because it doesn't, I don't mind that it's low dimensional or not, but it has to be something that's easier to think about."}, {"time": 8206, "text": "By us humans."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "Or my algorithms."}, {"time": 8209, "text": "Or the algorithms being like control, optimal."}, {"time": 8213,

state representation, I'm okay if it's linear."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "But if I have to think about all the possible shattering combinatorics of that, then my robot's gonna sit there thinking and the soup's gonna get cold or something."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "So since you taught the course, it kind of entered my mind, the idea of underactuated as really compelling to see the world in this kind of way."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "Do you ever, you know, if we talk about onions or you talk about the world with people in it in general, do you see the world as basically an underactuated

{"time": 8269, "text": "Exactly, I guess that's what I'm asking."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "I do think it's everywhere."}, {"time": 8274, "text": "I think in some places, we already have natural tools to deal with it."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "You know, it rears its head."}, {"time": 8282, "text": "I mean, in linear systems, it's not a problem."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "We just, like an underactuated linear system is really not sufficiently distinct from a fully actuated linear system."}, {"time": 8290, "text": "It's a subtle point about when that becomes a bottleneck in what we know how to do with control."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "It happens to be a bottleneck, although we've gotten incredibly good solutions now, but for a long time that I felt that that was the key bottleneck in legged robots."}, {"time": 8307, "text": "And roughly now the underactuated course is me trying to tell people everything I can about how to make Atlas do a backflip, right?"}, {"time": 8318,

representation questions, and then how do you do control."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "And the thing that's a little bit sad is that, for me at least, is there's a lot of manipulation tasks that people wanna do and should wanna do."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "They could start a company with it and be very successful that don't actually require you to think that much about underact, or dynamics at all even, but certainly underactuated dynamics."}, {"time": 8360, "text": "Once I have, if I reach out and grab something, if I can sort of assume it's rigidly attached to my hand, then I can do a lot of interesting, meaningful things with it without really ever thinking about the dynamics of that object."}, {"time": 8372, "text": "So we've built systems that kind of reduce the need for that."},

than just pick and place."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "That's like a lot of people think of that, just grasping."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "I don't mean that."}, {"time": 8392, "text": "I mean buttoning

controller."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "I know we could hand design a controller that would do it, but I don't want that."}, {"time": 8419, "text": "I want to understand the principles that would allow me to solve another problem that's kind of like that."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "But I think if we can stay pure in our approach, then the challenge of tying anybody's shoes is a great challenge."},

topic."}, {"time": 8447, "text": "How important is touch?"}, {"time": 8449, "text": "We haven't talked much about humans, but I have this argument with my dad where like I think you can fall in love

about the emotional part of it."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "But for robots to interact safely while they're doing meaningful mechanical work in the close contact with or vicinity of people that need

is just awesome."}, {"time": 8522, "text": "That's just like the movie of Big Hero 6 and the concept of Baymax, that's just awesome."}, {"time": 8528, "text": "I think we should, and we have some folks at Toyota that are trying to, Toyota Research that are trying to build Baymax roughly."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "And I think it's just a fantastically good project."}, {"time": 8541, "text": "I think it will change the way people physically interact."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "The same way, I mean, you gave a couple examples earlier, but if the robot that was walking around my home looked more like a teddy bear and a little less like the Terminator, that could change completely the way people perceive it and interact with it."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "And maybe they'll even wanna teach it, like you said, right?"}, {"time": 8564, "text": "You could not quite gamify it, but somehow instead of people judging it and looking at it as if it's not doing as well as a human, they're gonna try to help out the cute teddy bear, right?"}, {"time": 8577, "text": "Who knows, but I think we're building robots wrong and being more soft and more contact is important, right?"}, {"time": 8587, "text": "Yeah, I mean, like all the magical moments I can remember with robots, well, first of all, just visiting your lab and seeing Atlas, but also Spotmini, when I first saw Spotmini in person and hung out with him, her, it, I don't have trouble engendering robots."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "I feel the robotics people really say, oh, is it it?"}, {"time": 8611, "text": "I kinda like the idea that it's a her or a him."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "There's a magical moment, but there's no touching."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "I guess the question I have, have you ever been, like, have you had a human robot experience where a robot touched you?"}, {"time": 8629, "text": "And like, it was like, wait, like, was there a moment that you've forgotten that a robot is a robot and like, the anthropomorphization stepped in and for a second you forgot that it's not human?"}, {"time": 8644, "text": "I mean, I think when you're in on the details, then we, of course, anthropomorphized our work with Atlas, but in verbal communication and the like, I think we were pretty aware of it as a machine that needed to be respected."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "And I actually, I worry more about the smaller robots that could still move quickly if programmed wrong and we have to be careful actually about safety and the like right now."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "And that, if we build our robots correctly, I think then those, a lot of those concerns could go away."}, {"time": 8680, "text": "And we're seeing that trend."}, {"time": 8681, "text": "We're seeing the lower cost, lighter weight

up, stick it on their tongue and whatever."}, {"time": 8716, "text": "And he said, watching his daughter convinced him that actually he needed to study tactile sensing more."}, {"time": 8725, "text":

perceive the world."}, {"time": 8738, "text": "But it's fundamentally different if you can do an experiment and if you can change the world and you can learn a lot more than a passive observer."},

apply force and touch."}, {"time": 8775, "text": "Yeah, I think it's just an exciting area of research."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "I think you're probably right that this hasn't been under researched."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "To me as a person who's captivated by the idea of human robot interaction, it feels like such a rich opportunity to explore touch."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "Not

know, for me, it feels like an industrial robotic arm would be better if it has a human element."}, {"time": 8854, "text": "I think like Rethink Robotics had that idea with the Baxter and having eyes

yeah."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So, I mean, there's still tons of research needs to be, you know, to be done."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "But yes, I think, you know, so."}, {"time": 1216, "text":

biological perspective?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Are you worried about it from a human perspective?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So, I mean, you know, mutations are sort of a general way for these

like, the membrane, the M protein, the E protein, the N and the S, the spike, is there some?"}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And there are 20 or so more in addition to that."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "But is that a dumb way to look at it?"}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Like, which of these, if mutated, could have the greatest impact, potentially damaging impact, on the effectiveness of the virus?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So it's actually, it's a very good question because, and the short answer is, we don't know yet."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "But of course there is capacity of this virus to become more efficient."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "The reason for that is, you know, so if you look at the virus, I mean, it's a machine, right?"}, {"time": 1559, "text": "So it's a machine that does a lot of different functions, and many of these functions are sort of nearly perfect, but they're not perfect."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And those mutations can have the greatest impact and make those functions more perfect."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "For example, the attachment to ACE2 receptor, right, of the spike, right?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So, you know, has this virus reached the efficiency in which the attachment is carried out?"}, {"time": 1591, "text": "Or there are some mutations that still to be discovered, right, that will make this attachment sort of stronger, or, you know, something more, in a way more efficient from the point of view of this virus functioning."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "That's sort of the obvious example."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "But if you look at each of these proteins, I mean, it's there for a reason, it performs certain function."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And it could be that certain mutations will, you know, enhance this function."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "It could be that some mutations will make this function much less efficient, right?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So that's also the case."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Let's, since we're talking about the evolutionary history of a virus, let's zoom back out and look at the evolution of proteins."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "I glanced at this 2010 Nature paper on the quote, ongoing expansion of the protein universe."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And then, you know, it kind of implies and talks about that proteins started with a common ancestor, which is, you know, kind of interesting."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "It's interesting to think about like, even just like the first organic thing that started life on Earth."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And from that, there's now, you know, what is it?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "3.5 billion years later, there's now millions of proteins."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "And they're still evolving."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And that's, you know, in part, one of the things that you're researching."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Is there something interesting to you about the evolution of proteins from this initial ancestor to today?"}, {"time": 1694, "text": "Is there something beautiful and insightful about this long story?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So I think, you know, if I were to pick a single keyword about protein evolution, I would pick modularity, something that we talked about in the beginning."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And that's the fact that the proteins are no longer considered as, you know, as a sequence of letters."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "There are hierarchical complexities in the way these proteins are organized."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And these complexities are actually going beyond the protein sequence."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "It's actually going all the way back to the gene, to the nucleotide sequence."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And so, you know, again, these protein domains, they are not only functional building blocks, they are also evolutionary building blocks."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "And so what we see in the sort of, in the later stages of evolution, I mean, once this stable structurally and functionally building blocks were discovered, they essentially, they stay, those domains stay as such."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So that's why if you start comparing different proteins, you will see that many of them will have similar fragments."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "And those fragments will correspond to something that we call protein domain families."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And so they are still different because you still have mutations and, you know, the, you know, different mutations are attributed to, to, you know, diversification of the function of this, you know, protein domains."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "However, you don't, you very rarely see, you know, the evolutionary events that would split this domain into fragments because, and it's, you know, once you have the domain split, you actually, you, you know, you can completely cancel out its function or at the very least you can reduce it."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And that's not, you know, efficient from the point of view of the, you know, of the cell functioning."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "So, so the, the, the protein domain level is a very important one."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "Now, on top of that, right?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So if you look at the proteins, right, so you have this structural units and they carry out the function, but then much less is known about things that connect this protein domains, something that we call linkers."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And those linkers are completely flexible, you know, parts of the protein that nevertheless carry out a lot of function."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "So it's like little tails, little heads."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So, so, so we do have tails."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So they're called termini, C and N termini."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So these are things right on the, on, on, on one and another ends of the protein sequence."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "So they are also very important."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "So they, they attributed to very specific interactions between the proteins."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "But you're referring to the links between domains."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "That connect the domains."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "And, you know, apart from the, just the, the simple perspective, if you have, you know, a very short domain, you have, sorry, a very short linker, you have two domains next to each other."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "They are forced to be next to each other."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "If you have a very long one, you have the domains that are extremely flexible and they carry out a lot of sort of spatial reorganization, right?"}, {"time": 1918, "text": "But on top of that, right, just this linker itself, because it's so flexible, it actually can adapt to a lot of different shapes."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "And therefore it's a, it's a very good interactor when it comes to interaction between this protein and other protein, right?"}, {"time": 1935, "text": "So these things also evolve, you know, and they in a way have different sort of laws of the driving laws that underlie the evolution because they no longer need to, to preserve certain structure, right?"}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Unlike protein domains."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And so on top of that, you have something that is even less studied."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "And this is something that attribute to, to the concept of alternative splicing."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "So alternative splicing."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So it's a, it's a very cool concept."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "It's something that we've been fascinated about for, you know, over a decade in my lab and trying to do research with that."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "But so, you know, so typically, you know, a simplistic perspective is that one gene is equal one protein product, right?"}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So you have a gene, you know, you transcribe it and translate it and it becomes a protein."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "In reality, when we talk about eukaryotes, especially sort of more recent eukaryotes that are very complex, the gene is no longer equal to one protein."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It actually can produce multiple functionally, you know, active protein products."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And each of them is, you know, is called an alternatively spliced product."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "The reason it happens is that if you look at the gene, it actually has, it has also blocks."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "And the blocks, some of which, and it's essentially, it goes like this."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "So we have a block that will later be translated."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "We call it exon."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "Then we'll have a block that is not translated, cut out."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "We call it intron."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So we have exon, intron, exon, intron, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?"}, {"time": 2064, "text": "So sometimes you can have, you know, dozens of these exons and introns."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "So what happens is during the process when the gene is converted to RNA, we have things that are cut out, the introns that are cut out, and exons that now get assembled together."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "And sometimes we will throw out some of the exons and the remaining protein product will become still be the same."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "Oh, different."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "So now you have fragments of the protein that no longer there."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "They were cut out with the introns."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "Sometimes you will essentially take one exon and replace it with another one, right?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "So there's some flexibility in this process."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "So that creates a whole new level of complexity."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Cause now."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "Is this random though?"}, {"time": 2118, "text": "Is it random?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "It's not random."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "We, and this is where I think now the appearance of this modern single cell and before that tissue level sequencing, next generation sequencing techniques such as RNA seed allows us to see that these are the events that often happen in response."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "It's a dynamic event that happens in response to disease or in response to certain developmental stage of a cell."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And this is an incredibly complex layer that also undergoes, I mean, because it's at the gene level, right?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "So it undergoes certain evolution, right?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "And now we have this interplay between what is happening in the protein world and what is happening in the gene and RNA world."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And for example, it's often that we see that the boundaries of this exons coincide with the boundaries of the protein domains, right?"}, {"time": 2192, "text": "So there is this close interplay to that."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "It's not always, I mean, otherwise it would be too simple, right?"}, {"time": 2200, "text": "But we do see the connection between those sort of machineries."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "And obviously the evolution will pick up this complexity and, you know."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "Select for whatever is successful, whatever is interesting function."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "We see that complexity in play and makes this question more complex, but more exciting."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "Small detour, I don't know if you think about this into the world of computer science."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "There's a Douglas Hostetter, I think, came up with the name of Quine, which are, I don't know if you're familiar with these things, but it's computer programs that have, I guess, exon and intron, and they copy, the whole purpose of the program is to copy itself."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "So it prints copies of itself, but can also carry information inside of it."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "So it's a very kind of crude, fun exercise of, can we sort of replicate these ideas from cells?"}, {"time": 2260, "text": "Can we have a computer program that when you run it, just print itself, the entirety of itself, and does it in different programming languages and so on."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "I've been playing around and writing them."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "It's a kind of fun little exercise."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "You know, when I was a kid, so you know, it was essentially one of the sort of main stages in informatics Olympiads that you have to reach in order to be any so good, is you should be able to write a program that replicates itself."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And so the task then becomes even sort of more complicated."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "So what is the shortest program?"}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And of course, it's a function of a programming language, but yeah, I remember a long, long, long time ago when we tried to make it short and short and find the shortcut."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "There's actually on a stack exchange, there's a entire site called CodeGolf, I think, where the entirety is just the competition."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "People just come up with whatever task, I don't know, like write code that reports the weather today."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "And the competition is about whatever programming language, what is the shortest program?"}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And it makes you actually, people should check it out because it makes you realize there's some weird programming languages out there."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "But just to dig on that a little deeper, do you think, in computer science, we don't often think about programs, just like the machine learning world now, that's still kind of basic programs."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "And then there's humans that replicate themselves, right?"}, {"time": 2369, "text": "And there's these mutations and so on."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "Do you think we'll ever have a world where there's programs that kind of have an evolutionary process?"}, {"time": 2380, "text": "So I'm not talking about evolutionary algorithms, but I'm talking about programs that kind of mate with each other and evolve and like on their own replicate themselves."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "So this is kind of the idea here is, that's how you can have a runaway thing."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "So we think about machine learning as a system that gets smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter."}, {"time": 2401,

and mate and evolve and replicate."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "Do you ever think about that kind of world, when we jump from the biological systems that you're looking at to artificial ones?"},

interact and exchange the information, right?"}, {"time": 2442, "text": "So I don't see why not."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "I mean, it could be sort of a natural evolution in this area of computer science."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "I think it's kind of an interesting possibility."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "It's terrifying too, but I think it's a really powerful tool."}, {"time": 2458, "text":

injected into that bots, right?"}, {"time": 2468, "text": "But those bots are pretty dumb."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "You know, they're probably pretty dumb algorithms."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "You know, it's interesting to think that there might be bots that evolve together with humans."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And there's the sea of humans and robots that are operating first in the digital space."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And then you can also think, I love the idea."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Some people worked, I think at Harvard, at Penn, there's robotics labs that, you know, take

parts."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "But it's interesting to, within that robot, add the ability to mutate and do all the interesting like little things that you're referring to in evolution to go from a single origin protein building block to like this weird complex."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And if you think about this, I mean, you know, the bits and pieces are there, you know."}, {"time": 2554,

"So the goal is to, you know, to essentially, to optimize your search, right?"}, {"time": 2570, "text": "So, but sort of the ideas are there."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "So people recognize that, you know, that the recombination events lead to global changes in the search trajectories, the mutations event is a more refined, you know, step in the search."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "Then you have, you know, other sort of nature inspired algorithm, right?"}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So one of the reasons that, you know, I think it's one of the funnest one is the slime based algorithm, right?"}, {"time": 2604, "text": "So it's, I think the first was introduced by the Japanese group, where it was able to solve some pre complex problems."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "So that's, and then I think there are still a lot of things we've yet to, you know, borrow from the nature, right?"}, {"time": 2628, "text": "So there are a lot of sort of ideas that nature, you know, gets to offer us that, you know, it's up to us to grab it and to, you know, get the best use of it."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Including neural networks, you know, we have a very crude inspiration from nature on neural networks."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "Maybe there's other inspirations to be discovered in the brain or other aspects of the various systems, even like the immune system, the way it interplays."},

going on in there, which all of which are not modeled in artificial neural networks."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "And maybe if you throw a little bit of that biological spice in there, you'll come up with something, something cool."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Drake equation that estimate, I just did a video on it yesterday because I wanted to give my own

exciting paper published in Nature where they found one of the simplest amino acids, glycine, in a comet dust."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So this is, and I apologize if I don't pronounce, it's a

3943, "text": "So in bioinformatics, we have several competitions."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "And so the way, you know, you often hear how those competitions have been explained to sort of to non bioinformaticians is that, you know, they call it bioinformatics Olympic games."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And there are several disciplines, right?"}, {"time": 3963, "text": "So the historically one of the first one was the discipline in predicting the protein structure, predicting the 3D coordinates of the protein."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "But there are some others."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "So the predicting protein functions, predicting effects of mutations on protein functions, then predicting protein, protein interactions."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "So the original one was CASP or a critical assessment of a protein structure."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "And the, you know, typically what happens during this competitions is, you know, scientists, experimental scientists solve the structures, but don't put them into the protein data bank, which is the centralized database that contains all the 3D coordinates."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "Instead, they hold it and release protein sequences."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "And now the challenge of the community is to predict the 3D structures of this proteins and then use the experimental results structures to assess which one is the closest one, right?"}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And this competition, by the way, just a bunch of different tangents."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "And maybe you can also say, what is protein folding?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "Then this competition, CASP competition has become the gold standard."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "And that's what was used to say that protein folding was solved."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So just to add a little, just a bunch."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "So if you could, whenever you say stuff, maybe throw in some of the basics for the folks that might be outside of the field."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "So, yeah, so, you know, so the reason it's, you know, it's relevant to our understanding of protein folding is because, you know, we've yet to learn how the folding mechanistically works, right?"}, {"time": 4078, "text": "So there are different hypothesis, what happens to this fold?"}, {"time": 4082, "text": "For example, there is a hypothesis that the folding happens by, you know, also in the modular fashion, right?"}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So that, you know, we have protein domains that get folded independently because their structure is stable."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "And then the whole protein structure gets formed."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "But, you know, within those domains, we also have a so called secondary structure, the small alpha helices, beta schists."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "So these are, you know, elements that are structurally stable."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And so, and the question is, you know, when do they get formed?"}, {"time": 4120, "text": "Because some of the secondary structure elements, you have to have, you know, a fragment in the beginning and say the fragment in the middle, right?"}, {"time": 4129, "text": "So you cannot potentially start having the full fold from the get go, right?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "So it's still, you know, it's still a big enigma, what happens."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "We know that it's an extremely efficient and stable process, right?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "So there's this long sequence and the fold happens really quickly."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "So that's really weird, right?"}, {"time": 4151, "text": "And it happens like the same way almost every time."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "That's really weird."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "That's freaking weird."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "It's, yeah, that's why it's such an amazing thing."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "But most importantly, right?"}, {"time": 4164, "text": "So it's, you know, so when you see the, you know, the translation process, right?"}, {"time": 4169, "text": "So when you don't have the whole protein translated, right, it's still being translated, you know, getting out from the ribosome, you already see some structural, you know, fragmentation."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "So folding starts happening before the whole protein gets produced, right?"}, {"time": 4192, "text": "And so this is obviously, you know, one of the biggest questions in, you know, in modern molecular biologists."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "Not like maybe what happens, like that's not as bigger than the question of folding."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "That's the question of like, something like deeper fundamental idea of folding."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "Behind folding."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "So, you know, so obviously if we are able to predict the end product of protein folding, we are one step closer to understanding sort of the mechanisms of the protein folding."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "Because we can then potentially look and start probing what are the critical parts of this process and what are not so critical parts of this process."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "So we can start decomposing this, you know, so in a way this protein structure prediction algorithm can be used as a tool, right?"}, {"time": 4253, "text": "So you change the, you know, you modify the protein, you get back to this tool, it predicts, okay, it's completely unstable."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "Yeah, which aspects of the input will have a big impact on the output?"}, {"time": 4271, "text": "So what happens is, you know, we typically have some sort of incremental advancement, you know, each stage of this CASP competition, you have groups with incremental advancement and, you know, historically the top performing groups were, you know, they were not using machine learning."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "But what happens when we don't have these relatives?"}, {"time": 4347, "text": "This is when it becomes really, really hard, right?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "So that's so called de novo, you know, de novo protein structure prediction."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "And in this case, those methods were traditionally very good."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "But what happened in the last year, the original alpha fold came into and all of a sudden it's much better than everyone else."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "This is 2018."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Oh, and the competition is only every two years, I think."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "And then, so, you know, it was sort of kind of over shockwave to the bioinformatics community that, you know, we have like a state of the art machine learning system that does, you know, structure prediction."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "And essentially what it does, you know, so if you look at this, it actually predicts the context."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "So, you know, so the process of reconstructing the 3D structure starts by predicting the context between the different parts of the protein."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And the context essentially is the parts of the proteins that are in a close proximity to each other."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "Right, so actually the machine learning part seems to be estimating, you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems to be estimating the distance matrix, which is like the distance between the different parts."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "Yeah, so we call the contact map."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Contact map."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So once you have the contact map, the reconstruction is becoming more straightforward, right?"}, {"time": 4444, "text": "But so the contact map is the key."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And so, you know, so that what happened."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "And now we started seeing in this current stage, right?"}, {"time": 4455, "text": "Well, in the most recent one, we started seeing the emergence of these ideas in other people works, right?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "But yet here's, you know, AlphaFold2 that again outperforms everyone else."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And also by introducing yet another wave of the machine learning ideas."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Yeah, there don't seem to be also an incorporation."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "First of all, the paper is not out yet, but there's a bunch of ideas already out."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "There does seem to be an incorporation of this other thing."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "I don't know if it's something that you could speak to, which is like the incorporation of like other structures, like evolutionary similar structures that are used to kind of give you hints."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "Yes, so evolutionary similarity is something that we can detect at different levels, right?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "So we know, for example, that the structure of proteins is more conserved than the sequence."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "The sequence could be very different, but the structural shape is actually still very conserved."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "So that's sort of the intrinsic property that, you know, in a way related to protein folds, you know, to the evolution of the, you know, of the proteins and protein domains, et cetera."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "But we know that, I mean, there've been multiple studies."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "And, you know, ideally, if you have structures, you know, you should use that information."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "However, sometimes we don't have this information."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "Instead, we have a bunch of sequences."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "Sequences, we have a lot, right?"}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So we have, you know, hundreds, thousands of, you know, different organisms sequenced, right?"}, {"time": 4564, "text": "And by taking the same protein, but in different organisms and aligning it, so making it, you know, making the corresponding positions aligned, we can actually say a lot about sort of what is conserved in this protein and therefore, you know, structurally more stable, what is diverse in this protein."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "So on top of that, we could provide sort of the information about the sort of the secondary structure of this protein, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "So this information is extremely useful and it's already there."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "So while it's tempting to, you know, to do a complete ab initio, so you just have a protein sequence and nothing else, the reality is such that we are overwhelmed with this data."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "So why not use it?"}, {"time": 4616, "text": "And so, yeah, so I'm looking forward to reading this paper."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "It does seem to, like they've, in the previous version of Alpha Fold, they didn't, for this evolutionary similarity thing, they didn't use machine learning for that."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "Or rather, they used it as like the input to the entirety of the neural net, like the features derived from the similarity."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "It seems like there's some kind of quote, unquote, iterative thing where it seems to be part of the learning process is the incorporation of this evolutionary similarity."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "Yeah, I don't think there is a bioarchive paper, right?"}, {"time": 4657, "text": "No, there's nothing."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "There's a blog post that's written by a marketing team, essentially, which, you know, it has some scientific similarity, probably, to the actual methodology used, but it could be, it's like interpreting scripture."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "It could be just poetic interpretations of the actual work as opposed to direct connection to the work."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "So now, speaking about protein folding, right?"}, {"time": 4684, "text": "So, you know, in order to answer the question whether or not we have solved this, right?"}, {"time": 4689, "text": "So we need to go back to the beginning of our conversation with the realization that an average protein is that typically what the CASP has been focusing on is this competition has been focusing on the single, maybe two domain proteins that are still very compact."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "And even those ones are extremely challenging to solve."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "But now we talk about, you know, an average protein that has two, three protein domains."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "If you look at the proteins that are in charge of the, you know, of the process with the neural system, right, perhaps one of the most recently evolved sort of systems in an organism, right?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "All of them, well, the majority of them are highly multi domain proteins."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "So they are, you know, some of them have five, six, seven, you know, and more domains, right?"}, {"time": 4756, "text": "And, you know, we are very far away from understanding how these proteins are folded."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "So the complexity of the protein matters here."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "The complexity of the protein modules or the protein domains."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "So you're saying solved, so the definition of solved here is particularly the CASP competition achieving human level, not human level, achieving experimental level performance on these particular sets of proteins that have been used in these competitions."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "Well, I mean, you know, I do think that, you know, especially with regards to the alpha fold, you know, it is able to, you know, to solve, you know, at the near experimental level, pre big majority of the more compact proteins like, or protein domains."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "Because again, in order to understand how the overall protein, you know, multi domain protein fold, we do need to understand the structure of its individual domains."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "I mean, unlike if you look at alpha zero or like even mu zero, if you look at that work, you know, it's nice reinforcement learning self playing mechanisms are nice cause it's all in simulation."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "So you can learn from just huge amounts."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Like you don't need data."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "It was like the problem with proteins, like the size, I forget how many 3D structures have been mapped, but the training data is very small."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "No matter what, it's like millions, maybe a one or two million or something like that, but it's some very small number, but like, it doesn't seem like that's scalable."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "There has to be, I don't know, it feels like you want to somehow 10 X the data or a hundred X the data somehow."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Yes, but we also can take advantage of homology models, right, so the models that are of very good quality because they are essentially obtained based on the evolutionary information, right?"}, {"time": 4893, "text": "So you can, there is a potential to enhance this information and, you know, use it again to empower the training set."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And it's, I think, I am actually very optimistic."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "I think it's been one of this sort of, you know, churning events where you have a system that is, you know, a machine learning system that is truly better than the machine learning system."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "Better than the sort of the more conventional biophysics based methods."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "That's a huge leap."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "This is one of those fun questions, but where would you put it in the ranking of the greatest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence history?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "So like, okay, so let's see who's in the running."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "So you got like AlphaZero and AlphaGo beating the world champion at the game of Go."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "Thought to be impossible like 20 years ago."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "Or at least the AI community was highly skeptical."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "Then you got like also Deep Blue original Kasparov."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "You have deep learning itself, like the maybe, what would you say, the AlexNet, ImageNet moment."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So the first neural network achieving human level performance."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "Super, that's not true."}, {"time": 4987, "text":

"And I don't know if you can, what else is there?"}, {"time": 5057, "text": "But I think that's it."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "And then AlphaFold, many people are saying is up there, potentially number one."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "Would you put them at number one?"}, {"time": 5064, "text": "Well, in terms of the impact on the science and on the society beyond, it's definitely, to me would be one of the...

First time a machine probably beat a human at that scale of a thing, of anything."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "So that was, to me, that was like, you know, one of the groundbreaking events in the history of AI."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "Yeah, that's probably number one."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "Probably, like we don't, it's hard to remember."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "It's like Muhammad Ali

projects that people, you know, come up with."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "And so, and quite a few of them are actually, you know, they have some link to arts."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "I mean, you know, I think last year we had a group who designed an AI producing hokus, Japanese poems."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "So, and some of them, so, you know, it got trained on the English based, haikus, haikus, right?"}, {"time": 5496, "text": "So, and some of them, you know, they get to present, like, the top selection."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "They were pretty good."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "I

know, if you look at the, you know, the, like, grandmasters of music, like Bach, right?"}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So there is a lot of, there is a lot of, there is a lot of almost math."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "Yeah, well, he's very mathematical."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So this is, I would imagine that at least some style of this music could be picked up, but then you have this completely different spectrum of classical composers."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And so, you know, it's almost like, you know, you don't have to sort of look at the data."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "You just

have, you know, a song written by an AI engine to be like in top charts, musical charts, I wouldn't be surprised."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "I wouldn't be surprised."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "I

that basically become multi protein complexes?"}, {"time": 5648, "text": "Yes, you got it right."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "So it's sort of, it has the components of both of protein folding and protein, protein interactions."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "Because in order for these domains, many of these proteins actually, they never form a stable structure."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "One of my

actors in the majority of neurological processes at the molecular level."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "So it's a, and essentially it's a key player in the post synaptic density."}, {"time": 5713, "text":

domains."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "So pretty large proteins, I think 600 something assets."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "But the way it's organized itself, it's flexible, right?"}, {"time": 5741,

5754, "text": "So, and the type of the shape of this protein, it's in a way, there are some stable parts of this protein, but there are some flexible."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "And this flexibility is built in into the protein in order to become sort of this multifunctional machine."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "So do you think that kind of thing is also learnable through the alpha fold two kind of

that whole thing?"}, {"time": 5788, "text": "To me, it's yet another level of complexity because when we talk about protein, protein interactions, and there is actually a different challenge for this

few years in this competition."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "We typically don't participate in competitions, I don't know, don't have enough time, because it's very intensive, it's a very intensive

you think AlphaFold2 or something similar to it from DeepMind or somebody else will be, will result in a Nobel Prize or multiple Nobel Prizes?"}, {"time": 5908, "text": "So like, you know, obviously,

function, like it's doing something."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "So you can design different things."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "So you can, yeah, so you can, well, you can look at the proteins from the

the, what are the molecular determinant, right?"}, {"time": 6226, "text": "So that are built in, into the protein sequence, into the gene sequence, right?"}, {"time": 6230, "text": "So, and whether or not the machine learning can determine those, those components, right?"}, {"time": 6239, "text": "So like using machine learning to do, that's really interesting to, to, to given, give the input is like what the entire, the protein sequence and then determine if this thing is going to be able to do damage to a biological system."}, {"time": 6255, "text": "So, so I mean, It's a good machine learning, you're saying we don't have enough data for that?"}, {"time": 6259, "text": "We, I mean, for, for this specific one, we do."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "We might actually, I have, you know, have to back up on this because we're still in the process."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "There was one work that appeared in bioarchive by Eugene Kunin, who is one of these, you know, pioneers in, in, in evolutionary genomics."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And they tried to look at this, but, you know, the methods were sort of standard, you know, supervised learning methods."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "And now the question is, you know, can you advance it further by, by using, you know, not so standard methods, you know?"}, {"time": 6298, "text": "So there's obviously a lot of hope in, in transfer learning where you can actually try to transfer the information that the machine learning learns about the proper protein sequences, right?"}, {"time": 6311, "text": "And, you know, so, so there is some promise in going this direction, but if we have this, it would be extremely useful because then we could essentially forecast the potential mutations that would make the current strain more or less pathogenic."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "Anticipate, anticipate them from a vaccine development, for the treatment, antiviral drug development."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "That, that would be a very crucial task."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "But you could also use that system to then say, how would we potentially modify this virus to make it more pathogenic?"}, {"time": 6347, "text": "This, that's true."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "And then, you know, the, again, the hope is, well, several things, right?"}, {"time": 6359, "text": "So one is that, you know, it's, even if you design a, you know, a sequence, right?"}, {"time": 6366, "text": "So to carry out the actual experimental biology, to ensure that all the components working, you know, is a completely different matter."}, {"time": 6379, "text": "Difficult process."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "Then the, you know, we've seen in the past, there could be some regulation of the moment the scientific community recognizes that it's now becoming no longer a sort of a fun puzzle to, you know, for machine learning."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "Could be open."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "Yeah, so then there might be some regulation."},

rocket works, if a starting point, you have an end point and you're trying to hit a target, to hit a target with a virus is very difficult."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "It's basically just, right?"},

an audiobook, and that's some specific reason behind it."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "So the first book is something that sort of impacted my earlier stage of life, and I'm probably not going to be very original here."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "It's Bulgakov's Master and Margarita."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "For a Russian, maybe it's not super original, but it's a really powerful book, even in

of that, you have some irony, which is unavoidable, right?"}, {"time": 7071, "text": "Because it was that Soviet time."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "But it's very deeply Russian, so that's the wit, the

about a person who was sentenced for life in one of these camps."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "And he had some cancer, so he was transported back to one of these Soviet republics, I think it was South Asian republics."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "And the book is about his experience being a prisoner, being a patient in the cancer clinic, in the cancer ward, surrounded by people, many of which die."},

7199, "text": "So I read that there was some doctor saying that every single doctor should read this book to understand what the patient feels."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "But again, as many of the Solzhenitsyn's books, it has multiple levels of complexity."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And obviously if you look above the cancer and the patient, the tumor that was growing and then disappeared in his body with some consequences, this is allegorically the Soviet, and he actually when he was asked, he said that this is what made him think about this, how to combine these experiences."}, {"time":

one to me is the most powerful one."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And by the way, both this one and the previous one you read in Russian?"}, {"time": 7299, "text": "So now there is the third book is an English book and it's completely different."}, {"time": 7303, "text": "So we're switching the gears completely."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "So this is the book which, it's not even a book, it's an essay by Jonathan Neumann called The Computer and the Brain."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "And that was the book he was writing knowing that he was dying of cancer."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "So the book was released back, it's a very thin book."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "But the power, the intellectual power in this book, in this essay is incredible."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "I mean you probably know that von Neumann is considered to be one of the biggest thinkers."}, {"time": 7347, "text": "So his intellectual power was incredible."}, {"time": 7351, "text": "And you can actually feel this power in this book where the person is writing knowing that he will be, he will die."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "The book actually got published only after his death back in 1958."}, {"time": 7363,

single paragraph is just compact, is filled with these ideas."}, {"time": 7391, "text": "And the ideas are incredible."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "Even nowadays, so he tried to put the parallels

"57."}, {"time": 7411, "text": "So that was right during his, when he was diagnosed with cancer and he was essentially...

"Okay, so who's the honorable mention?"}, {"time": 7435, "text": "And this is, I mean, the reason I put it sort of in a separate section because this is a book that I recently listened to."}, {"time": 7443, "text": "So it's an audio book."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "And this is a book called Lab Girl by Hope Jarron."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "So Hope Jarron, she is a scientist, she's a geochemist

thousands of years ago."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "And so something that incredibly touched me by this book, it was narrated by the author."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "And it's an incredibly personal story, incredibly."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "So certain parts of the book, you could actually hear the author crying."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "And that to me, I mean, I never experienced anything like this, reading the book, but it was like the connection between you and the author."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "And I think this is really a must read, but even better, a must listen to audio book

1485, "text": "Because the supply of gold above ground only really increases at 1% to 2% a year."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "So it's sort of inhuman, which is a good feature, right?"}, {"time": 1494,

super concrete about what the supply schedule is and the fact, crucially, that it can't change."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So we can't have a bailout of debtors."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Let's say a lot of people had debts denominated in Bitcoin and we needed loose, accommodative monetary policy to bail them out."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "We couldn't have a jubilee denominated in Bitcoin because the social contract we've all bought into and committed to is that it's nondiscretionary."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "So that's sort of one of the first things."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And I think ultimately that comes back to basically a strong respect for property rights because if we were to have unanticipated inflation, let's say a really charismatic leader somehow commandeered Bitcoin and

1565, "text": "An additional 9 million unanticipated would have a dilutive effect on everyone else."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And that would be a covert way of effectively stealing their purchasing

leader?"}, {"time": 1581, "text": "Well, we've had people that have had a lot of influence in Bitcoin in the past and they've tried to make changes to the protocol, not as dramatic as that, but Bitcoiners have generally resisted those individuals, institutions, and Bitcoiners have a good track record of sort of staying true to those core values."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So you mentioned values and sticking to the monetary thing, but there's bigger values."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "There's almost like psychological values that are instilled in Bitcoin."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "You make a point that Bitcoin for many is a vessel, quote, for their expectations, hopes, and dreams."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "Can the Bitcoin protocol support this kind of complexity of the human condition?"}, {"time": 1631, "text": "So, like, there's ideas of freedom that seem to be spoken about."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "There's a sort of ideas of, I mean, even love."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "I mean, some people kind of use it as a meme, like, you know, Bitcoin is love or something like that, you know, mostly to troll me because I talk about love all the time."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "But, you know, these bigger ideas than just the exchange of currencies."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin itself is very simple, I would say."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Like, ultimately, it doesn't, you know, pretend to do very much."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "It really just settles transactions."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "But people do superimpose their own views on it, for sure."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And Bitcoin's qualities give rise to these perceptions of it having censorship resistance or giving you transactional freedom or a measure of transactional privacy."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "So because anyone can operate a node and join the consensus process and because mining is a competitive free market process, that means that it's likely that you can't be censored by the miners."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So that means you have transactional freedom."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "So you have these computer science technical features of the system that cause it to have these political qualities, which is it's very hard or impossible to censor a specific individual."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "So it's interesting to see that flow."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "So that's one of the core values, for sure, is the censorship resistance."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "Then you have the fact that it's a cryptographic based system and you can hold value in your brain by memorizing 12 words, for instance."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "That gives it seizure resistance, which is, again, a political concept."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "If you wanted to desert your jurisdiction with your wealth intact in your brain, that cryptographic feature of the system, the fact that it's built on public key cryptography and that you can encode a Bitcoin private key in 12 words, that gives it this political salience that you're now empowered relative to a despot, basically."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's so many beautiful concepts behind cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin, that stand for sort of freedom, some of the basic things at the founding of this country."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "The one thing I don't like personally behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that money is involved and it's like people's life savings sometimes are involved, so there is naturally a kind of fear, a self preservation, like instinctual kind of

are beautiful, just like the founding principles of this country."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So that's just like, so I like staying on the level of like the philosophy versus the level of like all my money is invested in Bitcoin and that becomes very tricky territory to have principle discussions about ideas."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Well, it's an interesting tension."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "I try to stay balanced despite being very exposed to Bitcoin."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So let me ask the ridiculous question, just in case, who is Satoshi Nakamoto and is it you?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "It's probably not me because I was like 17 when Satoshi mounted Bitcoin, 16, so unlikely and also not really a programmer."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So there's a lot of theories, but honestly, it's one of the greatest mysteries of all time because even Bitcoiners that have been around since day one, really, you know, people that were around before Bitcoin came out, they're on the mailing list, they're active in the cypherpunk community, you ask them and they sincerely will not know and they may not even have a good guess as to who Satoshi is."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Is it important to know or is it like actually important not to know?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Do you think that's a feature or bug that you, we don't know?"}, {"time": 1895, "text": "Some people don't like the uncertainty, especially, you know, folks on Wall Street, they really want to know."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And if you read the Coinbase S1, their disclosure pre IPO, that's a risk factor that Satoshi could come back."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So the risk management crowd wants to know because they want to know if maybe Satoshi had, you know, undesirable political opinions or something that would forever taint the project."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Do you think they were just trolling with that risk with Satoshi's identity being a risk factor or is that like actual, like, was there an actual meeting and a discussion of that being a risk factor?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "I think in the risk factor sections of the prospectuses, it's really just the lawyers doing a total brain dump to cover absolutely everything they can think of."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "So it's just lawyers."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "It's not like, you know, it's like, I think Elon was somewhere in the legal documents for SpaceX mentioned that like Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Like they threw that in there and it feels like, yeah, that could be lawyers, but it could also just be Elon trolling."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "So I wonder if it's like the Coinbase folks trolling or if it's lawyers."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "I hope it's the trolling, not the lawyers."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "The Coinbase leadership, they're not as big trolls as Elon is, but I mean, it's a risk for sure from their perspective because let's say Satoshi

to 1.2 million Bitcoin, which is like 50, 60 billion dollars worth."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "So some people consider that to be a risk."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "You think it's, you know, this is

"text": "I mean, and the block size wars are really fascinating discussion of how governance debates intersect with technical features."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So I guess we can, yeah, so basically at the highest possible level, Bitcoin is a globally shared."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "It's really a replicated ledger that any participant that wants to be an equal peer on that ledger, they want to maintain that ledger and they want to stay up to date with the global state of the ledger."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And really any monetary system is just a ledger with physical cash."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "We benefit from the physical instantiation of the money."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So the physics is the ledger."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "The physics is a ledger, right?"}, {"time": 2275, "text": "Same with gold, right?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "You can't just produce new units of gold."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "So we trust that gold atoms are hard to create, although not impossible, right?"}, {"time": 2286, "text": "You could find a bunch of protons and whatever is the adjacent metal and create gold atoms would be expensive."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "And the same with dollars, you know, we trust that it's hard to counterfeit a dollar."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "So we trust the physical analog world to help maintain the state of that ledger with digital money, like, you know, the money in your bank account, your checking account."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "We basically trust our institutions or banking institutions to keep a faithful record."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And then ultimately we trust the central bank to administer that system."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "So there's kind of a handful of nodes."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "In Bitcoin, we trust that the economic incentives of the system are carefully poised, basically."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "So we trust that the free market mining competition will lead to the miners assembling transactions into blocks in a faithful and correct way, and that we are going to converge on a global state of the ledger continuously."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "Which updates every 10 minutes or so with some variance."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And then the miners aren't the sole entities that control the system."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "To really participate, if you are a merchant and you're accepting Bitcoin, you really want to run your own full node and check the whole history of transactions."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Sort of something like, I want to say, five to six hundred million transactions that have ever occurred on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So full node contains all the transactions ever transacted on the Bitcoin blockchain."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And that's, I saw it's like 200 gigs or something like that."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "Like 350, something like that."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "It's doable on a regular consumer laptop and that is going to be really key later on in the discussion."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "But so, you know, that's really the ultimate trust models."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "First of all, we trust that the miners that assemble transactions into blocks and they are the archivists, you know, they inscribe those transactions onto the ledger and they have an economic incentive to sort of behave correctly because they're getting paid in no units of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "That's part of it."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "But then really you are also, you're not fully trusting them."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "You're actually, if you want to run a node, you replay every single transaction in the history of Bitcoin from the beginning to the current day and you arrive at the present state that way."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "So you don't really have to trust too many people or entities."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "You can validate the correctness that all the rules have been followed, that all the Bitcoins that were created were done so in the valid way, that the inflation rate was adhered to and that there's no covert inflation, you know, that if you're spending 50 units of Bitcoin, you had that Bitcoin to spend in the first place."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "So it's sort of delicately poised between node operators who, you know, engage in this validity checking kind of anti counterfeiting checking and then also the miners which are an industrial entity and they basically produce block space and assemble transactions in a box."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "And everybody, so the miners are incentivized to not mess with the system because they're getting value from the system."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So if they mess with it, it's going to decrease the value of their physical work investment."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "Yeah, so they have to incur a real physical cost to produce a block, right?"}, {"time": 2488, "text": "So right now you get 6.25 Bitcoins in a block at a minimum and then maybe some fees as well."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "How hard is it to produce a block now?"}, {"time": 2498, "text": "Well, challenging."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "I mean, you need, so 6.25 Bitcoins and a Bitcoin is worth $55,000 or so."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So it's probably going to cost you about that amount to produce it because it's a free market competition and miners have very thin margins."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "So it's like if I auction off a dollar, you would pay up to $0.99 to buy that dollar from me."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "Exactly what happens with miners."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "They're, you know, basically competing for the right to obtain new units of money."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "So logically speaking, they would pay up to the value of that money in order to earn it."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And for people who are not familiar, the process of mining is solving a difficult cryptographic problem that's a computational problem."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "I would say it's not like people sometimes represent it as like a really challenging puzzle."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "Like the individual puzzle is very simple."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Like you can do it with pen and paper if you wanted, you know, like SHA256."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "It's just that you're searching through the big mathematical space to find the needle in the haystack."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "You're just doing lots of iterations of a simple puzzle."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "It's just brute force."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "Hence, like the stability of the whole idea of the proof of work."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "If there was a shortcut, it wouldn't work."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "So let's hope nobody solves SHA256."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot of discussions from the quantum computing space, but everybody I talked to, all my colleagues that work in quantum computers say that we're quite a long way away from that being an issue in cryptography and certainly an issue in cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "That should have been one of the sides on these dice."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "It should have been quantum because I don't think it is."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "I forgot to put it on this edition."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "People should check out Scott Aaronson."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "There's a lot of people that are kind of selling quantum snake oil, so you should be very careful."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "I think it is a really exciting space that might change the world in the next decade or hundred, couple hundred years, especially for simulating quantum mechanical systems, but in quantum machine learning, people should check out TensorFlow quantum."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "It's a nice way to sort of educate yourself about the space."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "And actually, if you're pragmatically minded to, you know, through software engineering, explore how you simulate quantum circuits, how you run machine learning on those quantum circuits."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "The main point that Scott makes, Scott Aaronson, people should check out his blog too, is that like, there's not yet a single machine learning application that doesn't do almost as well in a classical computer."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So it doesn't like, yes, the dream is somehow quantum computers will change the nature of artificial intelligence, but there's yet to be an actual algorithm or problem set or data set where that would be the case."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So skepticism is good in this space."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Anyway, that said, so you kind of explained how Bitcoin works."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "You also wrote a blog post recently, giving a shout out to the new book, The Block Size Wars."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "What is a block size?"}, {"time": 2703, "text": "What are the block size wars?"}, {"time": 2705, "text": "It's history, it's importance, it's philosophical foundations."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin, at this point, we have our own civil wars, if you're wondering about how politically intense it gets."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "It's currently not hot, it's cold."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Oh yeah, we're in a detente right now."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "There's no tanks or missiles, at least not yet, hopefully."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "It can get a little violent, I guess."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "I think one of the Bitcoin core developers or one of the participants in the war got swatted at one point."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "What swatted means?"}, {"time": 2739, "text": "When someone does a fake phone call saying that you're holding someone hostage at your house and the SWAT team goes, it's pretty scary."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Internet warfare tactic, yeah."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "But the block size war, I would say, effectively ended, although we're definitely going to have more civil wars in Bitcoin, for sure."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "But basically, the core argument was a technical one on its surface, but a very deep political one at its core."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "The technical question is, how many megabytes should be in each successive block?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So, Satoshi basically installed a limit of one megabyte per block."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "So, we should backtrack."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "There was no limit in the beginning, and it seems like Satoshi, what is this, 2000, the war started in what, 2017 or something like that?"}, {"time": 2793, "text": "2015 was when the battle cries began."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "What was the first battle in the Civil War?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I don't remember."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "But, Satoshi, I don't know if you can comment on it."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Why did Satoshi set the limit to one megabyte all of a sudden, almost secretively, and in the beginning, there was no limit whatsoever?"}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we can get into, and people have spent thousands of hours poring over Satoshi's writings to find which side Satoshi was on, and you can find, like any textual exegesis, you can find evidence for either side, right?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "But, yeah, I mean, effectively, when Bitcoin was launched, there was a block size, because if you made a block over a certain size with the first edition of the code, it would have crashed nodes."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "But then, yeah, in 2010, Satoshi added the one megabyte limit in a covert way with no comments or anything, and that stuck, basically."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "And then Bitcoin blocks filled up, and people that had been socialized into this vision of Bitcoin as an effectively free transactional network were like, why pay a transaction fee if you're not at congestion?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "If the block isn't full, the miner will mine your transaction for free, right?"}, {"time": 2870, "text": "And people that had been brought up in that status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015, they noticed the block started to fill up, and they're like, okay, well, let's just remove this arbitrary limit, right?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "What could possibly be the harm?"}, {"time": 2885, "text": "And then a whole other faction said, no, you need to cap the data throughput of the system, because if you increase it, it's going to be highly exclusionary, and ultimately, regular folks are not going to be able to run a full node."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "So there's a fixed number, there's a fixed frequency of blocks, and so if you want to increase the number of transactions per second, you want to increase the size of the block."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot of transactions."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "Small blocks don't, so that's what you mean like constraining the system."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "So what's the benefit of a small block size where transactions, you can squeeze in only a small number of transactions, and what's the benefit of a huge block size where you can squeeze in a lot of transactions?"}, {"time": 2935, "text": "Well, it really comes down to the way that you think about the system."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "So a lot of people wanted Bitcoin to be Visa scale, so to have blocks sufficiently large that you could accommodate a Visa level scale of transactions."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "Which is many orders of magnitude more transactions."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "That's right, I mean, preposterously larger in terms of data throughput."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "Then, you know, Bitcoin offers up, or at least it used to, 144 megabytes of space per day, and your average transaction is 350 bytes."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "So, you know, you could, at a push, do four or five hundred thousand transactions a day, which is not many."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "So if you wanted to get to Visa scale, you'd have to increase blocks obnoxiously large."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "The small blockers claimed that this would overwhelm the ability of any regular person to ingest that data and stay current at the state of the ledger, to replay all those transactions to ensure that the protocol rules were valid."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So basically, the small blocker contention is that you eliminate the trustlessness of the system by pushing a ton of data through the system, because only one or two industrial heavy duty nodes would ever be able to run the protocol at that point."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "So, by the way, in the Civil War, the two sides, as you're calling them, the small blocker and the big blocker sides."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "And so that takes us back to the thing that you mentioned, that a regular computer could be a node."}, {"time": 3030, "text": "And with big blocks, that's no longer going to be the case."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So just the number of transactions is going to blow up the size of the blockchain that every full node has to store."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "And so then, as opposed to a regular mom and pop type of node, you're going to have to have data centers."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "So they're going to have to be owned by large organizations."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "There's going to have to be very few of them."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "And that's how you centralize the control over this whole operation."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So the big blocker, yes, it allows you to be Visa and do a huge number of transactions, but it becomes centralized."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "And then the small blocker is, you cannot actually do kind of merchant style transactions, but you get the decentralized benefit."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Well, I don't even think the big blocker approach would allow you to be Visa, frankly, because there's effectively one node in the Visa network, right?"}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So you don't really need to maintain this peer to peer architecture at all."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And the amount of data you'd have to push through the network to reach Visa scale is a really preposterous amount."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "And we have now evidence for what happens when you try and scale up as a blockchain and do 10 million transactions a day, which is still not Visa scale, right?"}, {"time": 3111, "text": "I've seen what it's like to operate those nodes, and it's not pretty."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So there are totally genuine computer science physical limits, because it's a broadcast network."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "Everyone has to be aware of every transaction."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And that model, which gives you the trustlessness, the nice guarantees where everyone's an equal peer on the network, everyone has audited the full history of the transactions, that model falls apart under stress."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So the small blocker vision is that ultimately you would scale in a layered approach, with the base layer transactions being settlement style transactions, and payments happening at the other layers, basically."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Is that universally agreed upon, or to a large degree agreed upon that the small blockers have won in this debate?"}, {"time": 3167, "text": "Where would you put the current state of affairs?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "There was a wave of competing Bitcoin implementations, starting in 2015 with Bitcoin XT."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "Actually Gavin Andresen, who was the guy that Satoshi handed the reins to when Satoshi left, Gavin supported this large block proposal."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And so that didn't achieve consensus, and then there was Bitcoin Unlimited."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "And then later on, there was a genuine hard fork, where the large blockers couldn't push through their proposals on Bitcoin itself, so they just created a competing version of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "So by the way, maybe you can comment on, but sort of hard fork versus a soft fork, a hard fork is when it's no longer compatible."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "What's the right way to put it?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "They can't operate on the same blockchain, with the same protocol."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "Yeah, so there's a few ways to define them, and it gets controversial as well."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "One way to define it as a hard fork is an expansion of protocol rules, and a soft fork is a shrinking of protocol rules."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "That's an interesting way to find it."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "It's not very intuitive, so I don't like that way."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Another way is that a hard fork is backwards incompatible, whereas a soft fork is, in theory, backwards compatible."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "So in August 2017, basically the large blockers had had enough, and they said, we're going to hard fork Bitcoin, we're going to create a clone, an alternative version of Bitcoin, which has a shared history as Bitcoin itself, but you completely fork it and you create a new future."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "But everybody that had a balance on Bitcoin at the time also had a balance on the alternative coin, Bitcoin Cash."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "That's what it's called, Bitcoin Cash is the hard fork."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "That was one of them, there were more actually."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "What the heck is Bitcoin Satoshi's vision BSV, Bitcoin SV?"}, {"time": 3290, "text": "So this is all talking about increasing the max, the limit of the block size more and more and more."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "Yeah, that was one of the changes they wanted to push through."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "But BSV was a fork of Bitcoin Cash."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "Hard fork of Bitcoin Cash."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "Yeah, so now there's multiple big blocker blockchains floating around."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "These are pretty popular, sorry to interrupt."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "Are they popular?"}, {"time": 3315, "text": "I mean, if you look at the metrics, they're not."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "And they don't trade, I think each trade below 1% of the value of Bitcoin itself."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "I see, so measuring popularity is like how much they actually, oh, value of the frequency of trade."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "Oh, no, no, I mean, they do like a fair number of transactions, but there's no way to know that that is genuine or just contrived."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So ultimately, the true measure I think in my mind is just where the market prices these protocols relative to Bitcoin, because that's like a prediction market."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "If Bitcoin Cash was being priced at 50% of Bitcoin, you could say the market has given it a 50% chance of unseating Bitcoin, right?"}, {"time": 3358, "text": "But both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, which was a hard fork from Bitcoin Cash itself, are well, I believe at this point, well below 1% of the value of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And in like the ranking of different cryptocurrencies, what is it, Bitcoin, Ethereum?"}, {"time": 3374, "text": "Is Ethereum in value second?"}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Yes, number two."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "And then Bitcoin Cash is in the top five, right?"}, {"time": 3381, "text": "But it's just a fast drop off?"}, {"time": 3383, "text": "You know, I haven't checked lately, but I think it's reached kind of morbidity."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "You know, it doesn't really have much traction."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "The blocks aren't full."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "So the whole value proposition was, you know, we will get all this merchant adoption if we increase the block size."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "That just didn't materialize."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "In my view, they had a flawed vision of how adoption works and what blockchain should optimize for."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Maybe you get a Bitcoin Cash supporter on the show, they'll give you a different answer."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "But yeah, full disclosure, you know, I have my sympathies."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "And I think the small blockers won that skirmish for sure."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "So at this time, there's no merchant adoption and so on."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "So it's kind of its vision, the whole reason for existence, at least for now, hasn't materialized."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "And so that's an indication as possible that, well, it's a sign that perhaps that's the wrong way to accomplish the scalability."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Well, you know, first of all, I think the layered scaling model is definitely, definitely correct."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "I mean, that's absolutely the way these things have to work, given the constraints of blockchains."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "What is the layered scaling model?"}, {"time": 3452, "text": "It's really how all payment systems scale, blockchain or otherwise."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "And I think a lot of people don't understand this, is that there is no equivalent to scaling of the base layer in the regular payment space."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "That totally doesn't happen."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "All of them are built on layers."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "So Visa is like the fifth layer in the payment stack that ultimately depends on these utility scale settlement systems, like Fedwire, CHIPS, ACH, basically interbank settlement systems."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "So you've got these slow moving but high assurance settlement systems."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Fedwire is probably the number one, you know, like when you send a wire, that's using the Fedwire system typically."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "On top of that, you know, you have banks and then you have payment processors, and then you build up these layers and layers and layers, and then you have these fast payments, you know, Venmo PayPal, credit, debit, Visa, you name it."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "Those payments are not final when they occur."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "You know, a credit card transaction will not be final for 90 to 120 days."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So you've decoupled the payment, the financial message, and the settlement."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Those are distinct concepts."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "And the settlement happens on a deferred basis."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "So that's how you get scalability, is you have lots and lots of messages, but they don't settle for a long time."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "They might settle on a net basis, on an end of day basis."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "But so that's really how it works."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "And then you have Fedwire where your average transaction is in the millions of dollars, and there's only a few hundred thousand transactions a day."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "It's sort of an interbank settlement network."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "So that's my vision for how I think Bitcoin will develop too."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Bitcoin itself on the base layer is the slow moving high assurance final settlement network, where if you're sending money to the other side of the globe to someone you don't trust, where you want that payment to be final in a short period of time, and both counterparties know it's final, then you would use that."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "But if you wanted to buy coffee, you could do it on a second layer."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "Lightning would be one way."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "There's a bunch of side chains now."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "Or you could use a more centralized solution if you wanted."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And you only need like the base layer, whether it's Bitcoin, whether it's, I forget the terms you use for the credit card version, but you need that just to verify, just to like resolve any disagreements or shady shit."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And that's a really rare occurrence."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "So it's okay for that to be handled in a small block debate, handled at a rate that's much, much lower than the rate of the transactions."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "That's a really interesting idea that when we spend money, we didn't actually exchange the money most of the time."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "Yeah, most of the time you're not getting final settlement when you do a transaction."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "And oftentimes that causes, there's pluses and minuses on the plus side of huge efficiency if you use a credit network like Visa, but it's in the name credit, right?"}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Visa is extending you credit, right?"}, {"time": 3675, "text": "They're kind of guaranteeing your reputation to the merchant."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "But fraud happens all the time, right?"}, {"time": 3680, "text": "There's always fraud because you have this reversibility, right?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "And so you can engage in fraud against the merchant."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "If you have a final settlement, there's no possibility for fraud."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "So that's one reason merchants kind of like accepting Bitcoin because once you receive an inbound Bitcoin payment and you deliver some good or service, that payment can't be reversed."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "But frankly, most of the transactions we undertake on a daily basis do not require the strong assurances of final settlement."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "There's one exception, which is physical cash."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "With physical cash or the open dime, a cash like product, you actually are getting final settlement."}, {"time": 3725, "text": "But most online banking transactions, most P2P digital wallet transactions in the dollar system, they're not really final at all."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "You mentioned Lightning, Lightning Network."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "What are your thoughts on it?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "And what are your thoughts about any kind of alternatives?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "So Lightning is one potential payment solution built on top of Bitcoin where you have different assurances, different transactional assurances, but ultimately it's very proximate to the base layer."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So if something goes wrong, you can always basically settle to the base layer."}, {"time": 3764, "text": "Just layer two."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "Yeah, layer two, you could say."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And basically the intuition is it's kind of like opening a bar tab."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "So you go to the bar and you might drink a dozen beers over the course of the night, maybe half a dozen."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "And well, I guess nobody goes to the bar these days, but let's say you did."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "You open a tab and at the end of the night you settle up once."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "You're not necessarily paying each time you get another beer."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "So it's the same idea."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "You're opening a channel, an ongoing relationship with your counterparty."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "And so Lightning has you open a channel with the counterparty and you're sort of sending back and forth these cryptographic commitments saying, you know, I agree to send you some Bitcoin, but you don't necessarily settle each time you make a transaction."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "So you can do hundreds of thousands of transactions in a channel."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "The other thing Lightning proposes is saying, okay, well, now that we have channels established, what if we interlocked a number of channels together?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "So if you and I have a channel and, you know, me and my buddy have a channel, my buddy can now pay you because you have a relationship through me basically."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "And so Lightning is this network, this overlay network that sits on top of Bitcoin and allows people to transact in a much faster and less frictional way without the need for Bitcoin's kind of slow periodic settlement, assuming that everything sort of goes well."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Do you see any downsides to this?"}, {"time": 3854, "text": "Like, have you seen flaws in the whole system from a security perspective, from a scaling perspective, any of that?"}, {"time": 3860, "text": "Or is Lightning working well?"}, {"time": 3864, "text": "I use it."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "When I initially sold those dice, I sold them on Lightning."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "I was one of the first merchants to use Lightning back in the day, the first edition of the dice."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "So people could buy these dice somewhere?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "Well, they used to be able to."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "I haven't made a new edition recently."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "They're very scarce and very special."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "They're like physical NFTs."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Physical NFTs."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "I mean, the flaw with Lightning is really that you, you know, and this can be remedied in a number of ways, but you have to kind of prefund these channels."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So it's a weird concept to have to inject liquidity into a channel in order to accept a payment, you know."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "So I'm sure those user experience problems can be solved, but it's still in a state of relative immaturity."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "In terms of other ideas that are sidechains or soft forks of Bitcoin, you've mentioned something about Schnorr and Taproot."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "What are your thoughts about this update to Bitcoin in terms of its promise to improve privacy and scaling and so on?"}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And what other things are you interested, excited about in terms of the development of Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Well, Schnorr and Taproot, that's the first new protocol upgrade since SegWit in 2017, which was what laid the groundwork for Lightning to be developed, basically."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Schnorr and Taproot is really the first protocol change in three, almost four years now."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So we're very excited about it."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "I mean, is there something interesting to say technically about what are the things it's actually going to improve?"}, {"time": 3966, "text": "And maybe on the politics side, bringing a protocol change on Bitcoin, what does that actually involve?"}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's a huge deal because the last time we tried to make a change to the protocol, we had a whole civil war over it, and it was incredibly difficult to get SegWit activated in 2017."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "And it took all this brinksmanship and threats and all these campaigns, and it was this whole thing."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "Luckily, I think things have quieted down and there's much more consensus that Schnorr and Taproot is a good change to Bitcoin, and everyone generally supports it."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "But everyone kind of has PTSD over the last time."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "When we tried to change Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "And so we're sort of really dithering over how we actually want to implement it."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So it's taking forever because we're trying to set the protocol for how do you change Bitcoin itself."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "And all of our assumptions went out the window last time."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "So we're trying to reset and decide what is a legitimate way to institute a change to Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "So that's actually the big question right now."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "It's not, should we implement these changes?"}, {"time": 4031, "text": "We basically all agree that we should."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "It's a meta question is, what's the valid way to implement new changes to Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 4038, "text": "What's a way that is scalable in the long term and will last and people will consider credible?"}, {"time": 4044, "text": "Even if this one isn't controversial at all."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "So that's where we're at."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "We're basically debating over how do we implement this change that we all want."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "To get a feeling of how slow Bitcoin governance is and how deliberate it is, everybody collectively wants the change."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "But we haven't fully agreed on how we're going to put it into Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "So it's a classic sort of Bitcoin situation."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "But what it is, I mean, Schnorr is an alternative signature scheme."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "I think it was encumbered by a patent."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "And it had only just been unencumbered when Satoshi created Bitcoin, I believe."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "It's a better signature scheme than Elliptic Curves, which is what, than ECDSA, which is what Bitcoin uses."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And so it's been long enough that we now trust it."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "Kind of in cryptography, it's meant to be Lindy."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "You want to test it over time, and then it's considered safe to use."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "So Schnorr has been around for long enough that we've decided to rip out ECDSA and insert Schnorr, which is just a different signature scheme, which is more efficient."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "And it has better properties."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "Like if you want to do a multi signature transaction where many people collectively sign in order to permission a spend, that would be more efficient in a bytes sense than ECDSA, for instance."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "So it's pretty incremental."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "And then Taproot is all about having transactional conditions that are sort of withheld from final entry onto the blockchain."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "So it's kind of a way to have more private conditional transactions on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "So both of them, I would say, are incremental changes."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "Is this an over exaggeration that Schnorr and Taproot might improve privacy and scaling, which is like at the high level things that people mention?"}, {"time": 4160, "text": "Is that just like a dramatic way of trying to frame what's fundamentally an incremental improvement?"}, {"time": 4167, "text": "Yes, but incremental is the word, right?"}, {"time": 4169, "text": "We're not going to get an order of magnitude enhancement to either privacy or scaling, but we will get a considerable enhancement."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "But privacy and scaling are actually two sides of the same coin because you get more transactional privacy by removing data from the ledger so that there's less metadata for people to surveil and analyze."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "And that's also how you scale by compressing and being really space efficient with transactions."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "And the more parsimonious you are, the more economically dense each byte that everyone has to retain on the ledger is."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "And so those are very closely allied concepts."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "So do you mind if we go through some potential criticisms of Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 4216, "text": "I spent the last five years tackling these every day."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "Are the dice the same?"}, {"time": 4224, "text": "Those two are the same, yeah."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "There are three editions."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "So let's go with the dice."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Classic."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Classic situation."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "So that was the darknet marketplace set up by Ross Albrecht in the early days of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "That's one of the first killer apps for Bitcoin was being the payments network behind this darknet marketplace where you'd go to buy drugs and things."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And so that became associated with Bitcoin, if you remember the press coverage from back then."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "But over time that faded and it became less of a critique."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "So like the critique is that Bitcoin is something you would use for illegal activity, for drugs, for crimes, all those kinds of things, as opposed to for any kind of legitimate transactions and merchant transactions."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And today Bitcoin settles $10 billion a day and the vast, vast majority of it is completely legitimate."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "It's just a useful alternative system."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "But back then a huge fraction of all Bitcoin transactions were related to the basically illicit marketplaces."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "And if you're just tuning in, this incredible tall sighted guy has 11 common criticisms of Bitcoin that Nick, in a genius way, has put together."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Maybe you could do a couple more."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "It was Satoshi something, Satoshi Coins."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Satoshi Coins, we touched on that earlier in the episode."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "What if Satoshi returns and sells all of their coins?"}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So we don't know for sure how many coins Satoshi actually mined or produced because there's a degree of probabilistic analysis that you would do."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "There's a few thousand blocks that were mined by what we think is a single entity in sort of 2009."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And so if you add them all up, you get to about a million."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "So people think that Satoshi mined a million coins and then they're worried that Satoshi would return and market sell all the coins, thus crushing the price of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So looking at some of these, no CEO, I think we touched on that."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "We did, we see, we've already hit on the dice."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "No merchants, that's no longer true."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "There's a scalability one, and I think that one has addressed the idea that you're mentioning with the block size debates and the lightning network that by adding extra layers on top, you can achieve scalability."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "That's my vision, that's my theory."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And you can do it in a permissionless and a permissioned way."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "Like Coinbase is a big Bitcoin exchange."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "They provide scalability."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "They're a financial institution."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "You can settle up internally on their own database and then periodically settle to Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "So they do something like the lightning network internally, something like this similar kind of mechanism."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Well, honestly, I'm not sure exactly how it works."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "They might have that built in, but just generally speaking, institutional scaling is a model for scaling, right?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "Where you could have banks holding Bitcoin and they issue notes against Bitcoin, and those are your payments, and then the base layer is the settlement layer."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "I think that's what you're getting with the boiling oceans, is this is like the impact on weather, I suppose, on the environment."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So, you know, that is a concern that people have in terms of like the proof of work requires that there's a lot of computational resources being used and that requires a lot of energy and like some large percentage of the world's energy is used to mine Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "How would you respond to that criticism?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's been the loudest critique of Bitcoin this year in the press."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "This year, really?"}, {"time": 4463, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, it's not like a new criticism, but Bitcoin is consuming more energy than ever."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So, as the price rises, the electricity consumption rises, and so we've heard renewed, you know, bellyaching over this, for sure."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "I mean, if you don't believe that Bitcoin is useful, then you're inclined to think that all the energy consumption is a waste."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "So that's, you know, it's something that's sort of unrebuttable if you fundamentally contest the validity of the Bitcoin system."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "So if Bitcoin is like a thing that will take over, it will become like the main mechanism of financial transactions or transactions period in the world, then you say, well, the cost of energy use is actually quite low relative to the benefit it provides."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "If you think it's not going to be, if it's just a volatile way to make a little money in the short term, then you see the energy use as really wasteful."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "That's totally spurious, yeah."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "So then there's no really response, I suppose."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "That's, so I can totally, you know, get into the details of Bitcoin's energy mix and things like that, but that's like at a high level what the debate is."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "It's this normative question, like, does Bitcoin have an entitlement to consume any of the world's resources?"}, {"time": 4548, "text": "And that's actually where the debate should end much of the time because a lot of people fundamentally dispute the validity or usefulness of Bitcoin as a system."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "And so, of course, they're going to consider the energy usage illegitimate."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "Now, there's a lot of mitigating factors if you, you know, think the Bitcoin is potentially a useful system, which is Bitcoin consumes energy in a very peculiar way, which virtually no other industry does, which is that Bitcoin is a geography independent buyer of energy, which is not how we humans typically consume energy."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "Like, we need energy to be produced near to population centers, and we need it to be produced at the, you know, corresponding to the peaks and troughs of our consumption, right?"}, {"time": 4600, "text": "Because we have to 100% match the demand and the supply at all times, right?"}, {"time": 4604, "text": "Otherwise, we'd blackouts."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "So, Bitcoin doesn't care about any of that."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "It just buys energy on a constant basis."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And so, it's, you know, indifferent to where it's being produced."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "And so, the consequence of all that is that Bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise being wasted, basically."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "So, it will buy so called stranded energy assets that would not make it to a population center."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And in fact, most energy produced is, ultimately, does not sort of make it to, you know, your socket in your wall."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "And so, this is why so much Bitcoin is mined in China, for instance."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "It's not because, you know, Chinese industrialists had a special affinity for Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "It's because the Chinese grid had a massive overabundance of energy, and particularly in four provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "So, in those four provinces, those are all pretty distant from major population centers."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "So, because of that, you can't really transport the energy that easily."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And so, huge amounts of energy are curtailed or basically wasted in all those provinces."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "And so, miners set up shop there because they could mine Bitcoin with the excess energy."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "They could monetize this thing that otherwise was going to go to waste."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "So, you know, there's things like that which, you know, I think mitigate the reality."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Bitcoin is not really rival with our consumption of electricity."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "It's not depriving anyone of electricity."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "It's mostly these stranded assets that are going into supporting the Bitcoin network."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "So, maybe let's do a last one since you mentioned China."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "This is China control."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "So, if so much mining is happening in China, how do we prevent nation states from controlling much of Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 4719, "text": "Yeah, that's the flip side of a large portion of the blocks being mined in China due to this energy feature which I discussed, which is that there's a lot of Chinese miners for sure."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "Now, the question ultimately is, what degree of control do miners have over the Bitcoin system?"}, {"time": 4737, "text": "And that was part of the block size debate."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "I mean, the miners, when we implemented subgraded witness in 2017, the miners just didn't want to do it."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "Eventually, the users, the regular folks running nodes rebelled and basically said, look, we're going to implement this whether or not you do it."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "And it was a threat to the value of Bitcoin because if this threat had gone through, it could have split Bitcoin and it would have been really messy."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "So, the miners sort of capitulated."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "So, I think the current consensus is that miners do not have unilateral control over Bitcoin and that governance is more poised between people that run nodes, developers and miners."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "It's sort of a triumvirate where neither of them has, you know, total control."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "So, that's my current model for controlling Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "I think if you asked a miner, they would tell you they didn't feel that they had sort of unilateral control over Bitcoin either."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "What would be the reason for that in your mind?"}, {"time": 4829, "text": "Like, why might you be wrong?"}, {"time": 4832, "text": "If you look back at it in the future, what did you not understand about Bitcoin that will result in that?"}, {"time": 4843, "text": "I think for that to happen, one of two things would have to obtain, one of two things would have to happen for Bitcoin to just be irrelevant basically."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "Either central banks totally clean up their act and stop engaging in rampant money printing, which I don't expect that to happen anytime soon."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "I mean, it looks like we're normalizing this new regime of inflation, pro inflation, just to remediate the debt issues we have."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "So that would be one thing that would make Bitcoin cryptocurrency much less relevant as if everyone becomes totally assured of the soundness of sovereign currencies basically, namely the dollar, like the dollar being the main one."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "It seems like we're going in completely opposite direction."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "Most people seem to be noticing the stirrings of inflation in society."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "You might have noticed that too."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "It's showing up in commodity prices, lumber prices, in food, obviously in financial assets."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "It'll show up in consumer prices generally soon."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "So that would be one way for Bitcoin to basically become irrelevant because it's a dialectical thing."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "Bitcoin is held in opposition to the established monetary regime."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "So if they completely reform themselves and the dollar becomes super sound once again and the Fed stops tinkering the way they constantly do, then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as much."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "The other thing would be if a completely superior design for a new sort of state independent monetary system emerged."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "But it's really hard to even imagine how that would come to emerge."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "And there's good reasons to think that Bitcoin, the conditions of its launch were extremely favorable and hard to replicate."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "Can you speak to some of those conditions, why it's a unique timing wise moment for Bitcoin to emerge?"}, {"time": 4970, "text": "So obviously Bitcoin was born in the depths of the financial crisis, which gives it a nice historical element."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "But that was kind of a coincidence."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Honestly, we know that Satoshi had been working on it earlier in 2017."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "The really special thing about Bitcoin was that it was launched anonymously by an entity that did not seek any glory or credit for what they did and apparently never monetized it at all."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "So they never really moved any of their coins."}, {"time": 5003, "text": "Satoshi sent one test transaction to Hal Finney, who is one of the earliest Bitcoiners."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "Aside from that, as far as we know, Satoshi never spent any of their coins."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "So you have this wonderful Promethean quality whereby it's almost self sacrificial."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "I mean, it's like this borderline godlike figure in terms of their restraint finds this monetary technology and releases it to the world and pays the price."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "They never took advantage of their filthy lucre."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "They never recognized any of the $50 billion that they made from Bitcoin."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "And Satoshi also didn't assign themselves any privileged access to the coins."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "Satoshi could have just written in the code, I own 10% of the coins."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "But they didn't."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "They just mined in the open free market competition like everyone else."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "It's just that Satoshi is an early miner to support the network, accumulate a lot of coins for sure."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "But they didn't have any privileged special access."}, {"time": 5064, "text": "So that's one thing that's extremely special about the launch is that we had a founder that was truly committed to the monetary protocol and didn't seek either recognition or financial spoils."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "And then also left."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "Satoshi left in 2010, 2011 and hasn't really been heard from

cryptocurrencies launched, they're aggressively pre mined and some gigantic Silicon Valley venture fund is going to own 30% of it."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "And so it's impossible to conceive of how that could become a global money because how could a Silicon Valley investment firm own 30% of the money supply?"}, {"time": 5162, "text": "That's just so oligarchical."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "So Bitcoin by contract is a very bottom up thing."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "It was the early enthusiasts, people that were really excited about the technology."}, {"time": 5179, "text": "They're the ones that obtained those early coins."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "And so there was a real element of fairness and just an organic nature to its launch, which would be incredibly hard to recapture today."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "Let's say Satoshi came back and they said, OK, I made Bitcoin 2.0."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "I'm going to release it."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "There would be the most aggressive land grab ever by gigantic pools of capital to sort of get favorable allocations of the new system."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "Can Satoshi with Bitcoin 2.0 build in a resistance mechanism or a prevention mechanism for the land grab?"}, {"time": 5218, "text": "It would be hard to because if you have capital and resources, I mean, if it was a proof of work chain, you just have people that would invest a ton of money in mining, for instance."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "But most new blockchains, cryptocurrencies are just sold, basically."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "They're issued in token offerings kind of thing."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "So it's hard to enforce through the protocol the decentralization of control power."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "It'd be challenging to and people have tried to do airdrops where they distribute coins to a large number of people."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "Basically doesn't work."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "Most people don't care about the airdrop."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "So it's hard to have an equitable distribution."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "I think the conditions of Bitcoin's launch were so lucky and favorable that they're very unlikely to be replicated."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "So I do think it's going to be a real challenge to ever have a new competitor that's as decentralized, as leaderless, as dispersed, sort of distributed as Bitcoin is, has its credibility."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "I don't know how you could overrule it on those important features."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "What about Bitcoin's comparison to other current cryptocurrencies?"}, {"time": 5279, "text": "So Bitcoin versus Ethereum, for example."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "Why is it possible that Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin?"},

qualities."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "Ethereum doesn't really aspire to be more sound from a monetary perspective than Bitcoin."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "In fact, the Ethereum leadership are sort of constantly tweaking the monetary policy."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "So they went for a completely different trade off."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "They also don't compete to be as decentralized from a governance perspective, right?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "Because there's leadership."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "There's an ETH foundation."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "There's a charismatic leader, Vitalik."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "And Ethereum has this policy of hard forks."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "So in Bitcoin, hard forks are extremely rare."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "In Ethereum, it's the default way to change things."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "So it's a much more adaptive system and it changes more frequently."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "But that also means that it's sort of they're incurring more risk when they introduce those changes."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "There's much more complexity."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So Ethereum is smart because they sort of understood Bitcoin as the top dog when it comes to a sound money, a digital gold type thing."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "And they went for all of the different trade offs."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "They wanted to be more of a platform."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "They wanted to have more complexity of the transactional layer."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "They wanted to take on more risk in terms of changing the protocol."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "They wanted to change more quickly."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "They wanted to make the monetary policy more mutable."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "So Ethereum

just a very different system."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "And I tend to think that Bitcoin is the most disruptive one because it's the most equipped to challenge sovereign currencies in the grand scheme."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Do you think they can coexist?"}, {"time": 5403, "text": "So like in the future, do you see a world where, you know, Ethereum captures some large percent of the

units of Bitcoin, I think over a billion dollars worth."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So not only do they coexist, they are actually mutualistic."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So they're like two creatures that have this, you know, it's like the rhino and like the bird that packs the parasites off the rhino's back or whatever."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "So I don't know which is which in the analogy."},

know, I always wonder why the alligator doesn't just eat the fish, but I guess they're brushing its teeth basically."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "So Ethereum is it gives you more transactional flexibility."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "There's much more experimentation happening there."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "It has this whole decentralized finance element."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "There's a huge number of Bitcoins that circulate on the Ethereum protocol, right?"}, {"time": 5474, "text": "Because Ethereum is open to other asset types, basically."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "So I think that's actually accretive to both systems because Ethereum gets to have this good form of collateral Bitcoin on the system, which is good volatility characteristics."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "And then it's a supply sink for Bitcoins, which are sort of now they're injected into this third party protocol."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "And that, I think, reduces the velocity of Bitcoin overall, and it's probably good for the valuation."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you see it quite possibly could be a symbiotic relationship."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "What are your thoughts about Vitalik,

ultimately."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "Like, I disagree with some of the decisions that were made along the way."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "Like, there's this infamous case of this bailout where 14% of Ether was lost in the smart contract, or really this smart contract that a lot of Ethereum leadership were sort of backing and supporting was hacked."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "And then the foundation with Vitalik's support chose to make a change to the underlying protocol to undo the hack, right?"}, {"time": 5559, "text": "So to me, that was not the most prudent approach, because you're basically violating the core protocol rules in order to undo, you know, to bail out a specific contract, which has failed."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "Granted, there was a lot of Ether in there."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "But I think that shook the credibility of the Ethereum system that happened back in 2016, I think."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "That was one reason why I became disenchanted with Ethereum."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "So basically, even if in that case that might fix an important problem that opens the door to centralized, like, manipulation of the protocol in the future."}, {"time": 5602, "text": "Yeah, it basically demonstrates that there's certain elites at the protocol level that can exercise specific control over the system."}, {"time": 5602, "text": "And, you know, a lot of people have lost money in hacks on Ethereum, a lot of contracts have gone south, huge amount of value, but they didn't get a bailout."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "And it was just when, you know, this specific contract called the DAO was hacked, that, you know, the leadership intervened."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "And, you know, to their credit, they haven't had a significant intervention or bailout since then."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "But it did normalize the practice."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "And I think it weakened the social contract."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "So I would prefer that you sort of bite the bullet in that situation, and you accept the failure of that contract."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "There'll be a ballsy move to bite that bullet."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "Yeah, I mean, and then you would have had like, what they thought was a malicious entity in control of a lot of coins."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "I think the real reason they sort of felt that they had to undo it was because they'd always planned to move to this proof of stake world, where your political control over the system is a function of your wealth in the system."},

"That's sort of my theory."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that makes sense."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "It kind of reminds me of the bailout of car companies."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "You know, this is difficult."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "There's a lot of people that criticize the bailout of these large companies, you know."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Yeah, creative destruction."},

corporate sector in Japan in the 90s, there was this like slow motion insolvency where basically firms weren't allowed to fail."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "And the Japanese corporate sector lost competitiveness because bad firms did not fail."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "And so, you know, the process of actual capitalism for the market clearing didn't occur."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "So I'm always in support of, you know, of the free market being allowed to clear for non profitable firms to fail."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "It's complicated, man, because creative destruction seems to be in the long term a positive."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "But human civilization is such that short term pain has real impact on people, you know."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "Yeah, policymakers don't

suffering."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "And that's a difficult thing to live with."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Like, yes, in the long term, you want inefficiency to be destroyed and efficiency to be rewarded."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "But there does seem to be a base level of like quality of life that we want to uphold."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "That's a difficult thing to think about."},

it."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "I mean, I think that's the issue with modern central banking, really, is that the central bank always has an incentive to lower interest rates."}, {"time": 5914, "text":

these long term debt cycles."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "And we're sort of at the end of one now, is because we couldn't take our medicine, we couldn't, you know, let interest rates clear, we

million?"}, {"time": 6003, "text": "You can't rule anything out with Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So I mean, I'm not, you know, wanting to put price targets on it."}, {"time": 6003, "text":

think it's done, you know, monetizing and being adopted globally."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "You think it can become like the base layer for a lot of our financial operation, like become the main base layer for all our transactions."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "So like, even banks will use Bitcoin, essentially, and like Visa would use Bitcoin as the base layer, like it would actually operate very similarly at the surface layer, but at the base layer would all be Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "That's precisely what I expect."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "And banks and Visa are already using Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So Visa has embraced Bitcoin in a really big way, actually."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "And it's always funny to the people saying Bitcoin has to change in a certain

cheaply."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And those are great qualities."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "If you're a depositor in a bank, they can prove to you how much Bitcoin they have."}, {"time": 6165,

accountable, because you can withdraw it."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "Because, you know, making Bitcoin transaction is pretty easy at the end of the day."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "Unlike fiat

like, okay, I'll just be a part of the Dogecoin community."}, {"time": 6315, "text": "And they did all these funny publicity stunts, like, they paid to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the

about Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "But yeah, he's, I mean, who am I to question the meme, right?"}, {"time": 6390, "text": "Like, yeah, I can't, you know, dissect internet culture and

technical ideas."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "But cryptocurrency is also, like in the case of Dogecoin, like for LOLs, at least originally, like a meme coin, but it's also a mechanism for investment."},

difficult."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "I don't know what to do with that set of ideas because a lot of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, is very volatile because it's new."}, {"time": 6603, "text":

growth there in that sector is partially a function of where we are in the actual credit cycle."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "So oftentimes, when inflationary events occur, you have correspondence

for other places to put it."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "So stocks, property, commodities, and then other asset classes, NFTs are an asset class."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "And this is a case with any inflation you look at in history, you saw these correspondence speculative manias, basically, speculative episodes."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So a lot of us feel that inflation is occurring, whether

like their lives depend on it, investing, trading, whatever, whether it's options, volumes, on Robin Hood, you know, like kind of retail brokerages, things like that, whether it's stocks, whether it's crypto, and then other collectibles, baseball cards, their valuations have been skyrocketing."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "And so I think NFTs are part of that."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "It's a new asset class."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "It's basically an opportunity to invest in sort of art or collectibles, in game items, things like that."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "I think that explains a

reference?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "And that has to be defined, there has to be some entity which says, oh, yeah, this unique string refers to like this piece of art or digital content, or, you know, trading card or whatever."}, {"time": 6885, "text": "So NFT, the concept itself is like an incredibly broad idea."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "It's just, well, what if we took, you know, barcodes, and put them on chain so that they could be traded."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And so they could circulate freely on a peer to peer basis and plugged into exchanges and things like that."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "So that concept is super valid, clearly has protocol market fit, right?"}, {"time": 6912, "text": "People are using it for a really wide array of purposes, it's completely going to exist."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "May the valuations contract of NFTs in the aggregate?"}, {"time": 6925, "text": "Definitely possible, probably likely."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "But I think the notion of creating enduring collectibles or artworks that have accompanying signatures, basically autographed art on the blockchain, that has totally been validated."}, {"time": 6948, "text": "I think that won't go away."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "I wonder if there's ideas, like BitCloud, for example, I don't know if you saw that, if there's ideas built on top of this concept, it doesn't have to be like Ethereum NFTs, it could be just the concept of non fungible tokens, whether those kinds of things can take hold."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "And they, it's less about financial transactions, and

know, investors."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "It's backed by some pretty big name investors, so I probably wouldn't use the word scam to describe it, but it's got Ponzi like dynamics, like everything in crypto."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "So there's very questionable, and then also is it using people's likeness without their permission, which is, I think, a legal question, you know, so there's open questions around it."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "But, you know, is our public blockchains and, you know, that sort of architecture, is that going to be useful for decentralized or alternative forms of

of people with good equipment don't take it seriously, it's such a taboo topic, that you have just like really shitty equipment collecting data."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "And so you have the blurry

quick he's able to figure that out."}, {"time": 854, "text": "You've written a book about how the role and power of the presidency has changed."}, {"time": 859, "text": "So how has it changed since

balance of power?"}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Like a president could not initiate this kind of assassination?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Correct, I think presidents did not have the same kind of

conclusion, and I think the research is pretty clear on this, is that structure has a lot more effect on us than we like to admit, which is to say that the circumstances, the institutions around us drive our behavior more than we like to think."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So Barack Obama, I'm quite certain, came into the office of the presidency committed to actually reducing the use of military force overseas and reducing presidential war making power."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "As a trained lawyer, he had a moral position on this actually, and he tried."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq and was of course criticized by many people for doing that."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "But at the same time, he had some real problems in the world to deal with,

to do this, and it's very hard to resist."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So that's, I think the criticism of Obama, the fair one would be that he didn't resist the pressures that were there, but he did not make those pressures."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So is there something about putting the responsibility on the president to form the structure around him locally such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?"}, {"time": 1321, "text": "So what I'm talking to is hiring."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "So basically just everybody you work with, you have power as a president to fire and hire or to basically schedule meetings in such a way that can control your decision making."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So I imagine it's very difficult to get out of Afghanistan or Iraq when most of

all."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "He used to, he hasn't done this in a while, but he used to call me up and yell at me on the phone, quite literally, when I would be quoted in the New York Times or

to keep power, but you forget why."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "And you often then use power, and I think Kissinger falls into this in some of his worst moments, not all of his moments, where the power

"text": "More and more data."}, {"time": 813, "text": "That data is more and more accessible to everybody and that accessibility and the fact that there's more of it means we can form more definitive truth proofs."}, {"time": 822, "text": "We can form more and more proofs and as we form those proofs, well, we can provide them to these blockchains and smart contract systems that consume them and then they're tamper proof, right?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "So they can't be manipulated."}, {"time": 834, "text": "And so now we've combined a system that can prove things with a system that guarantees a certain outcomes and we have a better system of contracts, which is actually an unbelievably powerful tool that has never existed before."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance, decentralized finance?"}, {"time": 853, "text": "What is it, what's its promise from both the philosophical and technical perspective?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "If we just zoom in on that particular space of the digital world."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Sure, so the decentralized finance is the instantiation of a specific type of smart contract, right?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "Or what I call hybrid smart contracts, which are these contracts that combine the on chain code together with the off chain proofs that something happened."}, {"time": 880, "text": "They're called a hybrid because they basically use both of these systems, right?"}, {"time": 883, "text": "The blockchain and the proofs about what happened."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And what DeFi is, is one specific type of hybrid smart contract that is taking on the contractual agreements you traditionally find in the global financial system, right?"}, {"time": 901, "text": "And that's basically the world of lending, the world of yield generation for people giving me or giving whoever their money and somebody giving back them yield back to them, which is what bonds do and what treasuries do and what a lot of the global financial markets do, as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection from different types of events and risks."}, {"time": 923, "text": "That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something's gonna happen."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And I'm either gonna protect myself by getting paid if it happens, or I'm going to benefit from it happening by basically saying it's gonna happen, putting money down on that, and that prediction will get me a return."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Now, that's a very large part of the global financial system, excluding all the stuff for global trade and letters of credit and all the stuff that facilitates international trade."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So excluding that at least for now."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So if we look at what decentralized finance does, it takes all of those agreements about generating yield, lending, and all of these types of things you find in global finance and the world of derivatives and a few other types of financial products."}, {"time": 964, "text": "And it basically puts them into a different format, right?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "So the format you have for centralized financial agreements is that you go to a bank, even if you're a hedge fund, even if you're like the richest people, you go to a bank, they make a product for you, and you hope that they honor the product that they made for you."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Or you do a deal with another hedge fund or whoever, some counterparty, and you hope that that deal is honored."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And then a number of very freaky things start to take place."}, {"time": 992, "text": "One of them is people don't have clarity about what the agreement is, right?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "So a lot of people don't know exactly what the agreement is between those parties because they can't actually see it."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Sometimes agreements are kept very private or parts of them are kept private."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And that keeps other counterparties, other people in the system from understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "This is actually partly what happened with the mortgage crisis."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically, there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets, but because the centralized financial system worked in such an opaque way, it was so unbelievably difficult to understand what was going on, right?"}, {"time": 1031, "text": "And so that lack of understanding for the global financial system basically led to a big boom, and then correspondingly, very, very big bust, which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody, even though they didn't participate in the boom part of the equation."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "In any case, what decentralized finance does is it takes these financial contracts that power the global financial system, it puts them in this new blockchain based format that basically at this point provides three very powerful things."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "The first thing that it provides is complete transparency over what's going on with your financial product."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So you have complete transparency into what's going on in the financial protocol that you have your assets in, which is because blockchains and the infrastructure, all of these things are built on, force that transparency."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Whereas the centralized financial system is very, very good at hiding it."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It's very good at hiding it and packaging things in a glossy wrapper, creating a boom, then a bust."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "The centralized finance is built on infrastructure that forces transparency such that everyone can understand what the financial product does from day one."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And in fact, escaping that property is practically impossible or if someone tries to escape it, it becomes immediately obvious and people don't use their financial product."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So that's number one."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "Number two is control."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So if you look at what happened with Robinhood, everybody thought the system worked a certain way, right?"}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Everybody thought I have a brokerage account, I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And then the market conditions changed within the band of what people thought they could do."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And everybody was fascinated to find out that, oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions in which I can control my assets is X, but it is actually Y, is actually much, much smaller band."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And the reason it is a much, much smaller group of market conditions is that the system doesn't work the way people think it works."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper and given to them to get them to participate in the system because the system requires and needs their participation."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "But if you actually look at how the system works underneath, you will see that it does not work the way people think that it works."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts, give people the version of the world they think they already have, which is why they don't beg for it, right?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So everybody thinks they're in a certain version of the world that works in this reliable way, transparent way, they're not."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "They don't realize it."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And so they're confused when you tell them, I'm gonna make the world work this way because they think they're already in that world."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "But then things like Robinhood make it immediately, painfully clear that that's not how the world works so that the second real property of DeFi is control, which means that you control your assets, not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "You control your Bitcoins, you control your tokens in the finance protocol."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "If you don't like how something's going in that protocol, you can remove it, you can send it to another protocol, or you can use a feature of the protocol to do something it's supposed to do."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Nobody can just say, oops, that feature, that isn't so good for my friends over here."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "That feature is actually, we're just gonna pause that feature in the critical moment when you need it to execute your strategy, which is why you took all the risks to begin with."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "And then the final reason, the final thing to know about DeFi is that DeFi is inherently global, and actually right now provides better yield globally."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar, you get 1% or less."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "It is this clarity about your risk."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "It is control over your assets."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And amazingly, at the same time as having those two unbelievably useful properties, it is actually superior yield, which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion that the only reason DeFi is more used is because more people don't know about it."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "And by virtue of this long kind of explanation here and elsewhere, more people will know about it."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And it's just such an obviously superior solution that I haven't heard a single explanation as to why."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "No, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk and have more transparency with your assets."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Earn 7% less, take more risk, and give people the ability to change the rules on you at their discretion, go do that."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Who's gonna do that?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And in general, on the first two of transparency and control, first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, they're deeply tied together in the sense that transparency gives control."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Transparency creates accountability, and there's this kind of game being played, game theoretic game, where if I know, if you know I'm gonna discover your deviation, you're not gonna deviate."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Yes, this could be a whole nother conversation, but just as a small aside, on the social network side of things, which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so, of how to do it right there, how to fix our social media."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And I tend to believe that human beings, if they're given clear transparency about which data is being stored, how it's being used, where it's being moved about, just all a clear, simple transparency of how their data is being used, and them having the control at the very minimal level of being able to participate or to walk away, and walk away means delete everything you've ever known about me."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "That will create a much, much better world."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "That currently there's a complete lack of transparency on social media, how the data is being used for your own protection."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of parallels to the central bank situation, and there's not a control element of being able to walk away."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Like being able to delete all your data, delete your account on Facebook is very difficult."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "It doesn't take a single click, which I think is what it should take."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "There should be a big red button that says, delete everything you've ever known about me, or like forget me."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So I think that coupled together can create a very different kind of world and create an incentivization that will lead to like progress and innovation and just like a much better social network and a really good business for the future social networks."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "But so I tend to see like control as naturally being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "It should all start at the transparency, which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Because like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way, any agreements that you're participating in."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And as a side comment also, what's really inspiring to me is that I think there's a greater, I don't know if this is always the case, but it seems like from having talked to people on the psychological element, there's a hunger amongst people for transparency and for control."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now, they want to know the reality of who you are as an individual."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So that means you can create businesses, you can create tools that are built on authenticity, a transparency."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And then the same, I'm inspired by the intelligence of people, if you give them control, if you give them power, that they would make good choices."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Of course, not everybody, but that means that decentralized power can create effective systems."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "So couple that, there's a hunger for transparency so we can move to a world where everyone's being just like real, conveying their genuine human nature."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And people are sufficiently intelligent that if they're given power in a distributed mass scale sense, that we're going to build a better world through that, as opposed to centralized supervised control or only a small percent of the population know what the hell they're doing."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Everybody else is clueless sheep."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Just to really quickly comment on this stuff that you just said, which I think is super, super, super fascinating."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "I think that's all exactly right."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "I think everything that you said is right."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So they get all the features, but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability to have control while getting all the features, right?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So banks give you features, social media sites give you features, whatever other system that you use online gives you features, and then it takes your data and it takes control of your assets from you in return for those features, right?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "I think the whole big difference here, partly in line with the definition of smart contracts and its evolution is that there's this, now there's this autonomous piece of code that's giving you all those features without requiring the ownership and lock in and control and unilateral kind of ownership of your data or your value or whatever it is that you're giving it, right?"}, {"time": 1718, "text": "And so this is just the recurring pattern of what I think all of this will do is it'll give people, it gives people a better deal, right?"}, {"time": 1726, "text": "It gives them features without ownership of data, without ownership of value, and that's really the difference."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So I think this is a good place to talk about smart contracts then."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "Can you tell me the history of smart contracts and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "Sure, so I think smart contracts as a definition has actually gone through some kind of changes or small evolution."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "Initially, I think it was actually a conception of a digital agreement that was tamper proof and could know things about the world, right?"}, {"time": 1757, "text": "So it could get proof and it could define that something happened and it could conclude an outcome and release payment or do something else."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "That's actually the definition of smart contracts that I began working in this industry with seven or eight years ago when I started making smart contracts."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "That is the conception that I had of a smart contract."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?"}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement that could also know things about the real world and release payments back to people about those events that were codified in this tamper proof format was actually a very tall order."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "Turns out it's consistent of three parts."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "It's consisting of the contract, the proof about what happened and the release of value."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "The way things have evolved so far is that the definition has now come to mean on chain code."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So it's come to mean the codification of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain that defines what the agreement is."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Now that eliminates the part of the definition that's related to knowing things about the world and it partly eliminates the definition about payments and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "But basically it's on chain code, right?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We in our recent work on a second white paper have actually put out a different definition that we call hybrid smart contracts that actually tries to go back to the initial definition that I started with seven or eight years ago, which basically says that there's some proof somewhere that's proven to the contract and the contract can know that and the contract can gain proof."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement that's codified on a blockchain."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "So you both need a mechanism to provide proof."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "You need a mechanism to codify the contract in a tamper proof way on something like a blockchain."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And then as with all contracts, there's a presumption that there's some kind of release of value."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So I think a smart contract in our industry right now means on chain code, which limits it to whatever can be done on chain only."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "And then in our internal definition for us and for us at Chainlink and for me, it's hybrid smart contracts, which is actually the original definition."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened and automatically resolve to the proper outcome based on what happened."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "So you're referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper, which is a paper that I recommend people look."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "It's a very easy read and very well structured and very thorough."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So I really enjoyed it."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Very recently released, I guess."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Can you dig in deeper?"}, {"time": 1913, "text": "What is a hybrid smart contract?"}, {"time": 1917, "text": "You mentioned sort of this idea of data or knowing about the world and on chain and off chain."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So what are the different roles in this?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact that it's on chain and off chain contracts."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?"}, {"time": 1941, "text": "Like how do you actually achieve that?"}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "That's the smart contract itself."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And that's where you codify certain conditions, such as the conditions under which an interest payment is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out the full amount that it holds to someone based on a derivative outcome or something like that."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Now, what the on chain code is very good at is creating transparency about what the core conditions of the contract are."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It's very good at taking in money from other private keys that send it tokens and send it value to hold."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And then it's also very good at returning money or returning value back to other addresses or other private keys."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "It can also be involved in governance."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It can be involved in a few other private key signature based operations."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "But primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract, from what I've seen so far, defines the agreement, takes in value and returns value based upon the conditions codified in the agreement on a blockchain."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "The second and equally important off chain part is where the term oracle and an oracle comes in or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network as we describe it in the paper."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "And this is another decentralized computational system that has a different goal, right?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions into blocks and connecting them in a cryptographically unique way to create security and assurance about that chain of transactions."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "Oracles and decentralized oracle networks achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization about the topic of what happened, right?"}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So blockchains structure transactions."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "Some of those transactions might be the state changes in different pieces of on chain code."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And then those on chain pieces of code require input."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit thrown by is despite being called smart contracts, the on chain code on a blockchain cannot actually speak to any other system."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So blockchains are valuable and useful as far as they're tamper proof and secure."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "And to be tamper proof and secure, they're made this kind of walled garden that is able to know and interact only with the highly reliable information that's within that system, which is basically tokens and private key signatures."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "All the other world's information is not available in a blockchain inherently."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And a smart contract or a piece of on chain code can't just say, hey, I'm gonna go get some data from over here because the API they would get it from creates a whole bunch of security concerns for the blockchain itself and a whole bunch of consensus issues about how to agree on what that API said or what the truth of the world is, right?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said, it's more so creating a reliable form of decentralized computation that can give you a definitive proof of what happened and not just what one API said."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So for example, some of our most widely used networks have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources that are all providing information about the same type of data."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And then there's consensus on that one piece of data, which is then written in and essentially given back into the on chain code to tell it what happened because you can't really make an agreement unless you know what happened, right?"}, {"time": 2154, "text": "If you and me were to make an agreement and set some contractual conditions, but our agreement could never know what happened, it would be completely useless."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "However, if you and me made an agreement and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism or decentralized Oracle network that proved what happened definitively and you and me pre agreed that whatever this mechanism says is what happened, then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "We can suddenly say, there's this piece of on chain code that's highly reliable."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "We can give it millions, billions, eventually trillions of dollars in value."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And it is controlled by this other system over here that's also highly reliable under this configurable set of definitive truth and decentralization conditions, which we all agree are sufficiently stringent to control that much value."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And therefore the combination of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract and this mutually agreed upon definition of a trigger or a proof system combined is a hybrid smart contract, which as you can see probably already does a lot more than just a contract on chain, right?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Can you talk about this consensus mechanism, which by the way is just fascinating."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "So there's the on chain consensus mechanism of proof of work and proof of stake."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism of what is true."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So how do you, can you compare the two?"}, {"time": 2246, "text": "Like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?"}, {"time": 2248, "text": "How do you achieve security in integrating data about the world in a way that's definitively true in a way that is usefully true, such that we can rely on it in making major agreements that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "Right, so this is the challenging, this is the challenging question, right?"}, {"time": 2271, "text": "This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks, Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on in order to create this definitive truth to trigger and create hyper automation in this more advanced form, more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "The reality I think of this problem is that it is very specific to each use case."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And it, and this is actually how we've architected our system is in a very flexible way."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network to grow in the amount of nodes that it has relative to the value it secures, right?"}, {"time": 2313, "text": "So if you have an Oracle network that secures a hundred thousand dollars in like a beta of a financial product, maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes and only two or three data sources, right?"}, {"time": 2324, "text": "Because the risk to that Oracle network is relatively low based on the value it secures."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So the first question is actually how do you scale security relative to value secured by that Oracle network?"}, {"time": 2339, "text": "Because it wouldn't be very efficient to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale and how do we compose ensembles of nodes in a decentralized way where we can know that, okay, we're going from seven nodes in a network to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?"}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So that's one dimension of the problem."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "So you have to be scaling the number of nodes relative to the value that's derived from the truth integrated into those nodes."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "Well, that's not the only problem, right?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "The other side of this is that you're trying to create a deterministic result, a deterministic output from a set of non deterministic disparate systems, data sources, or places that prove things."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "Can you also, just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?"}, {"time": 2391, "text": "What is the role of an Oracle node?"}, {"time": 2393, "text": "Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists in both places, it exists in both worlds."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It exists as an on chain contract that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "So there's an on chain interface in the form of a contract that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "You can request weather data from me, you can request price data from me, you can ask me to send a payment somewhere."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "So it's like an API, so it's a pointer to a API that provides truth about this world."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "It's an interface, so just like an API is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers, Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them or individual nodes are the interface of Web 3.0's use of services."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And services includes all services, data, payment systems, messaging systems, whatever Web 2.0 or any kind of computing service that you can conceptualize, needs an interface on chain in the form of a contract that says, here are the services I can provide for you, here are the transactions you need to send me to get back this data or that computation or this result."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "And then what you actually see is that decentralized Oracle networks, because they're uniquely capable of generating their own computations in a decentralized way around the data that they have access to, you actually see decentralized Oracle networks generating a lot of these services."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So for example, we have a randomness service, a verifiable randomness function service that basically provides randomness on chain and that randomness is then used in lotteries and various other contracts that need randomness."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "But that randomness, it's not a piece of data that comes from somewhere else."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "We don't go to another data source and get it."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "We generate it within an Oracle node that then provides it over into Oracle node or Oracle nodes that provide it into the contracts themselves."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So why do you say Oracle nodes are non deterministic?"}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Well, they are as far as they come to consensus, but there's this kind of different problem here, right?"}, {"time": 2525, "text": "The blockchains are very focused on generating blocks of transactions within a smaller universe of transaction types, a certain block size and a certain set of conditions."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And then they have a economic system that says, I will perpetually generate blocks of this size with these transaction types in this kind of limited set of transaction types, whether those are UTXO transactions or scripted solidity or whatever it is."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Oracles and Oracle networks, we don't have a blockchain, for example."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "There is no chain link blockchain."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Our goal is not to generate a certain set of very clearly predetermined transaction types into a set of transactions that are put into blocks and it will infinitely be done that way."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "Our goal is actually to create what we call a Meta layer, a decentralized Meta layer between the non deterministic, highly unreliable world and the highly hyper reliable world of blockchains so that the unreliable world can be passed through this decentralized Meta layer."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And it can coexist with a reliable on chain world."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases, the Meta layer might generate it."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So the problem in giving you this straight answer is that there's just such a wide array of services."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "If you were to say, well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness from a data source?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Well, we don't use a data source to generate the randomness."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "That's the type of service that can be generated in an Oracle network itself."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And so there'll be certain computations that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves to augment and improve blockchains."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And it is actually the goal of Oracles to consistently do that."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So if you were to think about the stack in a very generic high level, you would see blockchains or databases."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "They're basically the data structures that retain a lot of information in this transparent, highly reliable form."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "Smart contract code is the application logic."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "It is the logic under which all of this kind of activity occurs, storing data in the data structure in the blockchain as a database in a certain conceptualization of it."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "And then Oracles and Oracle networks are all the services that are used by the application code."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So, you know, by analogy, let's take Uber."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API from Google Maps about the user's location, sends a message to the user through Twilio, pays the driver through Stripe."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "If those services weren't available to the people who made Uber, they wouldn't have made Uber, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Because they would have written their core code on some database, and then they would have had to make a geolocation company, a telecom messaging company, and the global payments company."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "And that's the weird scenario that a lot of people in our industry are in."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And that's the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix is they provide these decentralized services to take this developer ecosystem, the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem from, hey, I can have a database and write some application logic about tokenization and voting and private key signing, all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "But now, if you just layer on all the world's services, whether that's market data, weather data, randomness, suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming, fraud proof global trade, fraud proof ad networks."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "And that's why this world of decentralized services and decentralized Oracle networks is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And you talk about the currents of a decentralized world, decentralized world, DeFi, but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And it's basically just financial transactions."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "And the kind of thing, the reason why it's super exciting, the kind of thing you do with Chainlink and Oracle networks is that you can basically open up the whole world of services to this kind of decentralized smart contract world."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude greater impact financially and just socially and philosophically."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Are there interesting near term and long term applications that excite you?"}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot that excites me."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And that is how I think about it, that it's not just about we made a decentralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "It's about we made a decentralized service or collection of services that's going from hundreds to thousands."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And then people are able to build the hybrid smart contracts, which I think will redefine what our industry is about."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Because for example, for the people that only learned about blockchains through the lens of NFTs, they understand blockchains through NFTs, not through speculative tokens or Bitcoins, right?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "And I think that will continue."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "I think the use cases that excite me, they vary between the developed market, the developed world's economies and emerging markets."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "I think in the developed world, what you will see is that transparency, creating a new level of information for how markets work and the risk that is in markets and kind of the dynamics that put the global financial system at systemic financial risk like 2008."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I think in the process of doing that and which is happening, I think right about now, you see a polishing of the technology such that it can be made available to emerging markets."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And on a personal level, I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more from this technology, just like the emerging markets benefit much more from the internet or from those $50 Android phones that people can have, because it's such a massive shift in how people's lives work, right?"}, {"time": 2897, "text": "I have always had access to books and a library, which has been fantastic and very important."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "But there are places in the world where people don't have libraries, but now they have the internet and a $50 Android phone and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I watch."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "I mean, that's kind of mind blowing realistically, right?"}, {"time": 2915, "text": "They just went from zero to one in a very, very dramatic way."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I think all of these smart contracts, and in my case, I think the one that I seem to keep coming back to is crop insurance, where partly because it doesn't have a tokenization component, partly because it's actually much more important than it might seem."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "What is crop insurance?"}, {"time": 2937, "text": "Right, so this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard to see the full value of what our industry does, because it solves all these kinds of backend problems that we don't have, right?"}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain, I get an insurance payout, so I don't need to close down my farm, because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?"}, {"time": 2959, "text": "So people in the developed world can get crop insurance and there's all kinds of systems that basically pay them out, and then they can argue with the insurance company if they don't get paid out properly and whatever."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And this allows people to smooth out risk."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "In fact, a lot of the global options markets were about this, right?"}, {"time": 2980, "text": "They were initially about people selling their produce or their crops ahead of time, so that if there was a risk of drought, they weren't impacted by it, right?"}, {"time": 2989, "text": "And that's where a lot of options trading and all this kind of stuff came from, even though it's now turned into this kind of global casino."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "But in the emerging market, there are literally people that, if they don't have rain for two seasons, they need to close down their farm and become a migrant worker of some kind."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And now they have a $50 Android phone where they can read Wikipedia, but they're still decades away from an insurance company coming to their geography and offering them insurance because their local legal system simply doesn't allow that type of thing to exist."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "No insurance company is gonna go and create insurance entity and offer them insurance because the levels of fraud and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts would just not exist."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "So now these people have to wait for decades to have this very basic form of financial protection or something like a bank account even."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "And with this technology, they don't, right?"}, {"time": 3042, "text": "So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone and the smart contract has data from satellites or weather stations about the weather conditions in the geography that my farm is in, I can put value into the smart contract and the smart contract will automatically pay me out back, pay me back out at my Android phone."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government not being able to provide a legal infrastructure to create insurance."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies that'll probably price gouge me and often not pay out."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper reliable kind of guaranteed smart contract outcomes that are as good or in many cases better than what farmers in all parts of other parts of the world have."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets of creating a way for people to control and manage risk in their economic life, I think extends way past insurance."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "It extends to them having bank accounts to combat local inflation."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "It extends to them being able to sell their goods on the free market of global trade without middlemen."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "It extends to all these things that we don't really care about, right?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Because we're not farmers, but are unbelievably impactful for people that don't have a bank account and their inflation rate in their country is double digits or their farm completely depends on rain or their livelihood completely depends on their ability to sell goods."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And they can't sell those goods because there's a middleman who essentially controls all the trust relationships."}, {"time": 3136, "text": "But now we have the internet and smart contracts and that might not have to be the case in the next five or 10 years."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "Yeah, so that definitely has a quality of life impact on the particular farmer's life, but I suspect it has a huge like down the line ripple effect on the whole supply chain."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "So like, it's almost hard to imagine the possible ways it might transform the world."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "I wonder how much friction there is in the system, I guess, currently that smart contracts might remove."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "That's almost unknown."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "You can sort of hypothesize and stuff, but I wonder."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "I've seen enough bureaucracy in my life to know that smart contracts in many cases would remove bureaucracy."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "And I wonder how the world will be once you remove much of the bureaucracy."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Coming from the Soviet Union, where I just have seen the life sucked out of the innovative spirit of human nature by bureaucracy."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "I wonder, the kind of amazing world that could be created once bureaucracy is removed."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Yeah, I think it's fascinating how the world can evolve."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "I think this extends a lot further than people think into many, many different parts of the global economy."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "It might start with NFTs for art, or it might start with DeFi, right?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Or it might start with fraud proof ad networks next."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "We don't know what it's gonna go to next, but I think the implication of people being in a system of contracts that holds them accountable and guarantees contractual outcomes, regardless of a local legal system, is something that I think extends to the supply chain."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way, and you can prove that in a way that can't be gamed."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "That'll change buying power and supplier power and how people produce goods that we all consume."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And then on the political level, I personally think that in a number of decades, we could literally be in a place where politicians can commit to a certain set of smart contract kind of budget, definitional kind of results."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "For example, we discovered oil."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "I promise as a politician, I'm gonna take the oil and I'm gonna redistribute it to all of you."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "Well, that's wonderful."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "That's a great idea."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "Sounds very nice when you're running for office."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "Why don't we codify that in a smart contract?"}, {"time": 3336, "text": "And why don't we put those conditions very solidly on a blockchain?"}, {"time": 3340, "text": "And then once you've been elected, we'll just turn that one on and it'll distribute the money just like you said, and everything will be fine."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "I personally think that this new level of systems that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody, between supply chain partners, ad network users, the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers, all of these are just interactions that require a trusted entity, or in this case, a trusted piece of code to orchestrate the interaction in the way that everyone agrees."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Yeah, one of the things that makes the United States fascinating is the founding documents."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And it's fascinating to think of us moving into the new in the 21st century to a digital version of that."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "So the constitution, a smart constitution, no offense to the paper constitution, and that would have transformative effects on politicians and governments, holding people accountable."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "Oh man, that's so exciting to think that we might enforce accountability through the smart contract process."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "Exactly, why can't that happen?"}, {"time": 3422, "text": "Anything that we could codify into a smart contract, and anything that we all agree is the way the world should work."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "And then anything that we can get proof about, right?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Anything that a system somewhere could tell us happened, those are the pieces of the puzzle, right?"}, {"time": 3439, "text": "We need a trusted piece of code, we need to have agreement that that's how the world should work, and we need a system that'll tell that trusted piece of code what happened."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "As long as we have those three things, we can theoretically codify any set of agreements about anything where those three properties take hold."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "I wonder if you could apply that to like military conflict and so on."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "Recently, Biden announced that we're going to pull off from Afghanistan after 20 years in the war."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "I wonder, there's a lot of debacles around war in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "Like that might have actually huge impact on the way we do conflict."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "So you think of the smart contract as a kind of win win situation where you're doing like financial transactions or something like that."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "But you could see that also about military conflict or like whenever two nations are at tension with each other, different scales of conflict, that you can have conflict codified."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "And that would potentially resolve conflict much faster because there's honesty, transparency and control within that conflict, because there's conflict in this world."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And I, again, very, very inspiring to think about the kind of effects it might have on the negative kinds of contracts, on the tense, painful kinds of contracts."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "I haven't thought about that as much."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "It's actually kind of scary, the stuff you're thinking through now with like the war contracts or something."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "That's not in the white paper."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "We don't have anything about war contracts or anything."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "Again, this is the Russian, we're both Russian, but I'm a little more Russian in the suffering side."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky and military kind of ideas."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "But anyway, holding politicians accountable in all forms, I think is really powerful."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "Is there something you could say as a small aside on how smart contracts actually work if we look at the code?"}, {"time": 3573, "text": "Is there some nice way to say technically what is a smart contract?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "What does it mean to codify these agreements, the actual process for people who might not at all be familiar?"}, {"time": 3586, "text": "I think you just write it into code that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "You usually write code that runs in a central server somewhere."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "Now you write code that runs across a lot of different machines in this decentralized way."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "And then after you write it, you need services."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And that's where oracles come in, they provide all the services."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So just like you would be writing code in web 2.0 land, running it on a server somewhere and using an API, here you'd be writing code, putting it on a decentralized infrastructure like a blockchain or a smart contract platform like Ethereum."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "And then you would be using various services in the form of oracles."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "So they'll just be called oracles or decentralized services instead of APIs."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "And you're basically composing the same type of architecture except it's hyper reliable."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "At the moment, it's a little bit less efficient because there's an early stage to our industry."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "But it provides this extreme level of reliability and transparency, which for certain use cases is an absolute critical component and is completely reinventing how they work."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "So I think people should look at what are the use cases where that trust dynamic can be so heavily improved."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "And that's probably the ones where this is maybe initially useful."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "But I mean, just to emphasize, I don't think people realize when you say code that we're talking about non obfuscated actual program."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "Like you can read it, you can understand it."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "And there's something about, maybe this is my computer science perspective of like software engineering perspective, but there's something about the formalism of programming languages, which enforces simplicity and clarity and transparency."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And because it's seen to everybody, I mean, simplicity is enforced."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "There's something about natural language, like language as written in the constitution, for example, where there's so many interpretations."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "With the nice thing about programs, there's not going to be a huge number of books written about what was meant by this particular line because it's pretty clear."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "Like programming languages have a clarity to them that natural language does not, and they don't have ambiguity, which I think it's important to pause on because it's really powerful."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "It's really difficult to think about."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "I think we live in a world where all the philosophers and legal minds don't know how to program."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "So I think, not all, most don't."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "And so we don't often see the philosophical impact of this kind of idea that the agreements between humans can be written in a programming language."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "That's a really transformative idea."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "That, I mean, yeah, it's an idea that's not just technical."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "It's not just financial."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "It's philosophical."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "It's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like what is human civilization?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "It's interaction between humans."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction that is managed by programming languages, by programs, by code."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "That we'll look back at this time potentially as one where us little descendants of apes did not realize how important this moment in history is."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "Like human beings might be totally different a century from now because we codified the interaction between humans."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "That might have more of an impact than anything else we do today."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "You think about the impact of the internet, one of the cool things is digitization of data."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "But we have not yet integrated the tools, the mechanisms fully that use that data and interact with humans yet."},

"Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements, maybe you disagree with this, but at least the way I'm thinking about it is agreements between humans or groups of humans."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "But it seems like because everything's operating in the digital space that you can integrate non humans into this."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Or AI systems that help out humans, managed by humans."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "Like what do you think about a world of hybrid smart contracts, codifying agreements between hybrid intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?"}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Yeah, I think that makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So it might be a bit simplistic or naive, my ideas in this field."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?"}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s."}, {"time": 3895,

people have... Just to understand, I work in the world of trust issues, right?"}, {"time": 3909, "text": "I work in the world of how can technology solve trust and collaboration issues using encryption, using cryptographically guaranteed systems, using decentralized infrastructure, right?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "So that's the world that I've been inhabiting for many, many years now, building smart contracts for seven or eight, doing stuff before that."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "It's kind of what I'm focused on."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "So I view AI through that same lens."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "And my brain naturally asks, well, what is the trust issue that people might have with AI?"}, {"time": 3937, "text": "And my natural kind of response is, well, let's say AI continues to be built and improve."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "I've seen different ideas that were very far from this."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "I've seen other ideas were very close to this."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI where we would be a little bit worried about just how much it could do, right?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "We might be worried that AI could do things we don't want it to do, but we still want to give AI a level of control over our lives, right?"}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So in my world, that's a trust issue."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "And the way that that trust issue would be solved with blockchains is actually very straightforward."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "You could have an AI that has an ability to do and control key parts of your and our lives, right?"}, {"time": 3988,

right?"}, {"time": 4006, "text": "That encryption continues to work, right?"}, {"time": 4009, "text": "And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able to do that, right?"}, {"time": 4016, "text": "So if you have an AI that controls something very important, whatever it is, shipping or something in defense or something in the financial system, whatever it is, but you're sitting there and you're kind of worried, hey, this thing is unbelievable."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "It's coming up with things we wouldn't have thought of in a hundred years, but maybe it's a little too unbelievable."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "How do you limit it?"}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Well, if you bake in private keys and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations, you can create the conditions beyond which an AI could never act."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "And those could once again be codified in the very specific unambiguous terms in which you described, which once again, in my trust issue focused world, would solve the trust issue for users and make them comfortable with using the AI or ceding control to the AI, which I think in more advanced versions of AI will continue to be a concern, right?"}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism for human supervision of AI systems."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "With encryption, very encryption heavy."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "It's about will the encryption hold up?"}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So that's based on the assumption that encryption holds up."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "I think that's a safe assumption."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "We can get into that whole discussion, but from quantum computing, but cracking encryption is very difficult."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "That's a whole nother discussion."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "I think we're safe on the safe ground for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "I, there's a space that is at the cutting edge of general intelligence research in the AI community, which is the space of program synthesis or AI generating programs."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "So that's different than what you're referring to is AI being able to generate smart contracts."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "And that to me is kind of fascinating to think of, especially two AI systems between each other, generating contracts, sort of almost creating a world where most of the contracts are between nonhuman beings."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "I think an AI system, as I think about it, and once again, this is not my field."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "This is something I might watch a YouTube video on or just see something interesting about at some point."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "I think if I were to just reason through it even now, I think the highly deterministic and guaranteed nature of smart contracts would probably be preferable to an AI because I'm guessing an AI would have a lot of problems with dealing with the human element of how contracts work today, right?"}, {"time": 4185, "text": "So an AI, for example, couldn't pick up the phone and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative and kind of discuss with Dave and have a call with him and kind of have a conversation and get him comfortable and tell him it's gonna be fine and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues that have to do with making certain derivatives."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated neural map AI kind of problem."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Yeah, so if I think about it, the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts probably would, and if, assuming they're accessible to AIs, could actually, interestingly enough, be the format that they prefer to codify their relationship with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems, right, because it is very, I mean, it's pretty guaranteed, right?"}, {"time": 4244, "text": "All the other types of contracts that an AI could go out there and seek to do would require some language processing around the law."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "And I think, I don't know if this is a term, but probably not a smart AI or a good AI or whatever the term is for a high quality AI, would probably realize some of the limitations and the risks."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity and would prefer the determinism, the deterministic nature of smart contracts."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "I do wonder about this particular problem and maybe you could speak to it of how smart contracts can take over certain industries in a sense or how certain industries can convert their sets of agreements into smart contracts, which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave from the bank, many of our laws, many of our agreements are currently through natural language, through words."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur in order to convert the legal agreements, legal contracts of today to smart contracts that by the way, AI may be able to help with."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "But by way of question, how do you think we convert the legal contracts on which many industries currently function today or not even legal contracts, but ambiguous kind of agreements, maybe they're loose sometimes into more formal deterministic agreements that are represented by smart contracts?"}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "I think the first one is actually not a huge problem where you have things like the is the master agreement for derivatives or you have these agreements that basically already reference a system somewhere, like for example, many legal agreements already accept eSignature."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And so they're saying, hey, I'm gonna use this computing system over here around signatures and I'm gonna consider, and there's laws around that and there's clauses that say eSignature is good enough for this agreement."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "I actually don't think this is a big problem for the vast majority of legal agreements that use systems already."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository or one set of system of contract settlement."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And you'll just say, hey, this blockchain system over here is my new system of contract settlement."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Whatever it says is the state of the agreement instead of the centralized system over there."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements that are already able to do that and I think we'll do that."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "I think there's another side to your question, which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous that can be turned into smart contracts."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "And I think the limitation there is twofold."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "First of all, like you said earlier, the highly reliable smart contract and the lack of opaqueness and the clarity of smart contracts is very high and very powerful and very clear and it's, in my opinion, gonna be much, much easier to take a smart contract and turn it into a set of natural language explanations and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?"}, {"time": 4467, "text": "Mapping smart contracts into natural language, I didn't even think about that."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "So that's, you're saying that's doable and natural and easy to do."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "Because there's so much clear, right?"}, {"time": 4477, "text": "There's that forced clarity that you talked about."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "I think the second aspect of this problem is the nuance around what contracts can be made unambiguous and I think that comes down to, often comes down to proving what happened, which is where Oracle networks and decentralized Oracle networks and Chainlink would come in and our experience there is quite extensive over the many years that we've worked on many different contract types."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "I think what it fundamentally comes down to is whether there is data."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "So we're not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract about whether somebody painted your house the right color blue."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "We're just not gonna be doing that because there's no data feed that tells us that your house was painted blue or that it was the right color of blue."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "You know, unless somebody sets up a drone with a color analysis tool and they generate that data."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Which by the way, it could be possible, right?"}, {"time": 4529, "text": "They could, there could be, if there's enough demand then the service would be created that has drones flying around that's telling you about the colors of, you know, all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "So if there's actual demand that that would be created and because there'll be value to connect that data feed to the smart contracts and so on."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "I think you have it unbelievably right because there are already insurance companies that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead and see how many people are wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats isn't sufficiently high, then, you know, the policy is voided."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And so in that case, there is a data source and that data source can be put into a hybrid smart contract."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is, is there a data source or a set of data sources to create definitive truth, to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "And then as you said, I think as people realize that smart contracts are a format in which they can form agreement about things like that insurance product around, you know, how many people are wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "If I'm the construction site owner, well, you know, I would really like a guarantee that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out if everyone is wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And in that case, there is demand for the data and people will generate the data."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And I actually think the insurance industry is interestingly a precursor of this because they're so data driven."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "You already see insurance companies paying IoT companies to put data into their customer's infrastructure at the cost of the insurance company to generate the data that the insurance company uses to make a policy for the customer."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "So you basically already have people who really want to price data into their agreements when they're of sufficiently high value paying for their own customers to get data sensors into their infrastructure."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And I think as smart contracts become more of a requested format or data driven contracts become more of a format, there will be a growing demand about proving what happened through data."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "So it'll be motivating totally new data feeds being created."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "By the way, the insurance industry broadly, the revolutions there, it would be huge."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles, semi autonomous and just vehicles in general."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "The insurance industry there, by the way, makes a huge amount of money, but is using very crappy data feeds, revolutionizing how like not by crappy, I mean very crude."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Like literally the insurance is based on things like age, gender, like basic demographic information as opposed to really high resolution information about you as an individual, which you may or may not want to provide."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So you can choose from an individual perspective to provide a data feed."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "And there like the power of insurance to enable the individual, to empower the individual could be huge because ultimately smart contracts motivate the use of data, the creation of new data feeds, but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth, as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "So that I'm not, again, not sure how that would change things, but in terms of the fundamental experience of life, because I think we all rely on insurance, not just in business, but in life and grounding that insurance in more and more accurate representation of reality might just have transformative effects on society."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said, where I noticed another trust issue, you said the user might not want to share their data."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "So what you could actually do, and what we've already worked on is, you can have a smart contract that holds the data and evaluates the data of the user without sharing it with the insurance companies."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And the insurance company knows that the smart contract will evaluate it according to the policy."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "They don't need the data."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "And the user can provide the data knowing it'll never touch the insurance company because it's only provided to the smart contract."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "And suddenly you've solved another trust issue because the autonomous piece of code can evaluate information separately from the interests of both of the counterparties."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "And so this is the recurring theme."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "And once you have an autonomous piece of code that can also know what's going on, thanks to Oracle networks and that combination of the code and the Oracle network for the hybrid smart contract, the same pattern just recurs."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "It's really the same pattern."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "And this is why I keep saying trust issues."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It's because I basically, almost every contractual trust issue that I see where there is a piece of data to prove and settle the trust issue in a way that works for both parties, there is no reason not to use an autonomous, highly reliable contract and piece of code."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "And I have to tell you, I've seen this in a lot of different industries."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "I've seen it insurance, ad networks, global finance, global trade, those are all multi trillion dollar industries."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And then there are other smaller industries."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "Like even one of the first smart contracts we worked on many years ago was for search engine optimization firms where they would tell you, hey, I'm gonna raise your search engine ranking, give me the money."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And people wouldn't wanna give them the money because they never knew if they were gonna do it."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And then the search engine firm doesn't wanna do any work thinking they'll never get any money."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "So we just initially even came up with a system where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract and it would be released based on whether the search rank of a website got to a certain level on Google for a certain keyword, right?"}, {"time": 4907, "text": "And so the trust problem was solved."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "But it's just the same story, right?"}, {"time": 4910, "text": "It's kind of like trust issues around AI, trust issues around financial products, trust issues around insurance, trust issues around social media, whatever it is."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "I think that's what people looking at this industry really need to understand."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "And once they do understand, they realize what this is all about."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "This is about redefining how everyone collaborates with everyone about everything where we can prove something through data."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy that the parties don't need to necessarily know private data in this interaction."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "You talk about confidentiality in the white paper for Chainlink 2.0."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality in this process?"}, {"time": 4959, "text": "Sure, sure, absolutely."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So I think you once again need to think of the contract as existing in two parts, right?"}, {"time": 4967, "text": "You have the on chain code and then you have this off chain system called the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So the question is really what portion of the contract should live in what part of these two systems, right?"}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So if you wanna create transparency, you should put more information on chain because that's what blockchains are very good at."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "They're public, transparent, but they don't necessarily have privacy."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "Well, you can see how those two things are a little bit kind of completely diametrically opposed."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So I do think and I do see blockchains working on on chain encrypted smart contracts."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "That's very inefficient."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "It has a lot of nuances around it."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "That I think will appear at some point."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "I think until it appears, you have an option of taking a part of the computation and putting it into the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "We actually did an entire paper about this that we presented at Stanford in February of last year, something called Mixicles, which basically talks about how you can take an Oracle network and you can put a portion of the computation into the Oracle network, assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set of nodes knowing what the computation is."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "And you could actually provide additional confidentiality through special hardware called trusted execution environments that all those nodes are forced to run."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "So they won't even know what they're operating."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And so at the end of the day, if you look at a hybrid smart contract as gaining functionality from its on chain code and gaining other functionality from its off chain decentralized Oracle network component, you can place the part of the computation that you would like to be private in the decentralized Oracle network, because you can control the set of nodes."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "You can control the committee of nodes and you can require that they run certain hardware to keep the information private, right?"}, {"time": 5088, "text": "So you could basically make a derivative that, or a binary option is the example used in the Mixicles paper where the payout happened on chain, but it was actually impossible to tell what the outcome of the contract was."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "So the outcome of the contract was computed in the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "Determined a certain outcome that the relevant user would get paid and there was still a place to put value, right?"}, {"time": 5145, "text": "So there is this kind of fundamental tension between confidentiality, privacy, which is very important for many contracts, which is critical to many contracts and the public and transparent nature of blockchains, which I think eventually will be solved through encrypted on chain smart contracts."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "That'll take some time, I think that'll take years in my opinion."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "And before we arrive there, I think people will put the private portion into the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "Once again, going back to what the decentralized Oracle networks do, they seek to provide these services, right?"}, {"time": 5181, "text": "So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation is perhaps a service without which a certain type of contract might never come into existence in the form of an on chain hybrid smart contract."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "And so this is once again, what we see the centralized Oracle networks and decentralized services doing is providing people these tools and building blocks to compose, like I'm great at making these derivatives contracts, but I can't make them unless I can retain the privacy of them."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "And our goal is to provide the infrastructure that gives you as a developer and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "And what we've seen is that as we provide that capability, people create more, which is also really the story of the internet, right?"}, {"time": 5227, "text": "The story of the internet is it was really tough to do eCommerce while everything was an HTTP and credit cards were transmitted publicly."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "And so eCommerce was kind of tough because how am I gonna send my credit card over public on encrypted channels, right?"}, {"time": 5241, "text": "But the second HTTPS appears, eCommerce becomes a lot easier because I can put in my credit card number and it can be sent over an encrypted channel and it's not at risk."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "And so I can participate in eCommerce as long as I have a credit card."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "I think those types, and I'm sure that was unexpected, right, I'm sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome from that technology."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And so I think this is why we sometimes have this focus on privacy because in our work with contracts and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form, we see a substantial amount of need for privacy as an inherent property of these contracts."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "And it'll take a while before that's possible to create the kind of technology innovation required to do that on chain."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "I know there's a few ideas that are being floating about, but so the currently distributed Oracle networks provide that feature, which is essential to many contracts."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "What brings to mind in this whole space, again, it might be outside of your expertise, but within the world which I'm passionate about, which is machine learning, and it seems like very naturally because current machine learning systems are very data hungry and much of the value mined by companies in the digital space are from data."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "They often want their data to maintain privacy."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "So you think about an autonomous vehicle space, Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data, Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "It seems like it would be very beneficial to form contracts where one could use the data from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way, but also where all the uses of data are codified and you can exchange value cleanly, basically contracts over data, over machine learning systems use of different data."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "I don't know, do you talk to machine learning folks that use ideas of smart contracts or is that for outside of your interest?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Because it seems like exceptionally applicable set of, when we talk about different services that might be created and revolutionized by smart, especially hybrid smart contracts, I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me in all industries."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "I don't know if you've gotten a chance to interact with those folks, with those services."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "I think what you're talking about is more data marketplaces in the data marketplace side of things."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "Well, this is actually once again, very applicable because there's a trust issue."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "At the end of the day, let's say I'm trying to sell you some data."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "You don't know the quality of the data."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "So you don't know what you wanna pay for it."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "And I can't give you the data for you to determine the quality because I've given you the data, right?"}, {"time": 5410, "text": "We need an autonomous impartial agent."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "We need an impartial computational kind of agent and on chain smart contract with an Oracle network to assess my data to write, to basically take random cross section samples of the data, assess it for quality, assess it for signal from the algorithm you have, which you don't wanna share with me because you don't wanna know the algorithm you're working on, right?"}, {"time": 5437, "text": "You don't want me to know what you want the data for."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm, keeping it private from me and takes my data, keeping it private from you, assesses it on a random cross section sampling for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you, allows you to determine a price."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And now both you and me know that we've arrived at a fair price for the quality of my data for what you wanna do with it."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And that's once again, from what I've seen in the data marketplaces, which are full of people who want that data for these learning models, often for financial markets, often for other reasons, this is their fundamental problem, which amazingly enough, there's a trust issue that is getting solved."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "And I think you can see even on the face of it, once that trust issue is solved, those markets can work a lot better, right?"}, {"time": 5496, "text": "I don't need to know your algorithm."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "You don't need to know my data."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "We both know that the autonomous agent is not under either of our control and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And we're all very comfortable with that."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "I could even make conditions that your algorithm isn't analyzing the data for something I don't want you to analyze it for, or you could make conditions that the data has to have any number of properties."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "And once again, you haven't leaked any signal to me and I haven't leaked any data to you, which is once again, just another type of trust issue that all of this solve."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "So it's the same pattern."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "If you work in this industry long enough, or if you really look at these use cases long enough, you'll simply come to the question, and this is the useful question, what is the trust issue this is solving?"}, {"time": 5544, "text": "And then if you can get an answer to that question on a case by case basis, that's when you'll understand why blockchains are relevant."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "And then once you do that with enough use cases, it becomes a little bit mind blank."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "You've mentioned trust quite a bit."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "You also mentioned trust minimization in the Chainlink White Paper."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "Can we dig into trust a little bit more?"}, {"time": 5571, "text": "What is the nature of trust that you think about in these smart contracts?"}, {"time": 5576, "text": "What is trust minimization?"}, {"time": 5578, "text": "How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?"}, {"time": 5583, "text": "I think it's important maybe to have a conception of what the alternative is, right?"}, {"time": 5587, "text": "What is highly reliable trust minimized off chain and on chain computation and alternative to?"}, {"time": 5594, "text": "So this is just kind of how I see the world in these two camps."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "One camp is the traditional, what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And this is the world as pretty much most or all people know today."}, {"time":

a nice logo."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "It's such a big building."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "Why don't I give them my money?"}, {"time": 5627, "text": "Why don't I interact with them on the basis of any kind of agreement?"}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And that is definitely better than that not being there."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "And that is definitely a huge improvement for how people conduct commerce."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "Letters of credit from branded entities are very important for global trade to take place in the early stages of global trade."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "So that's good, but it is fundamentally just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood or somebody else suddenly has to change, well, it changes and you can't really do anything about it."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "You won't be able to change anything about what happened there."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "There's

wrong."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And then in the cases when things go wrong, which they pretty much invariably at some point do, then you find out that, well, you know, turns out they don't have to

how do we evolve into that world?"}, {"time": 5821, "text": "Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus, right, it comes down to a collection of independent nodes, a collection of provably independent computing systems arriving at the same conclusion impartially."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "That conclusion might be the transaction is valid between address A and address B, address A has one Bitcoin, wants to send it to address B, now address B has one Bitcoin, right?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So that's one degree of validation."}, {"time": 5852, "text": "It has certain

money."}, {"time": 5928, "text": "So, you know, that's one example."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "Another example is, hey, we have a hybrid smart contract for something like crop insurance."}, {"time":

where there's one of many network effects where the more that smart contracts and Oracle networks are used, they themselves generate this immutable on chain data that proves their value and

low."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "And here's my Oracle network."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "And by the way, it's also settled a million of these."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "And so it's not the logo,

though, to think about banks, they're very old school and their ability to move quickly is questionable to me."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "I just look at basic online banking, like how good banks are creating a frictionless online experience."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "And I think they're not very good."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And so that speaks to the kind of people who are in leadership positions at banks, the kind of people they hire, the kind of culture there is."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "So I do wonder if banks will from inside revolutionize themselves to include smart contracts or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge that basically create new kinds of banks."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "Whether, what is the company square?"}, {"time": 6266, "text": "I think it

big organizations, whether it's Google or Microsoft or Bank of America, pivot hard in a world that's quickly changing."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "I think that takes bold leadership and a lot of firing and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings where the one asshole brings up the from first principles idea that, you know what, the ways we've been doing stuff in the past require, we need to throw that

supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "So once again, this is the big difference between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general and blockchains in my opinion."},

networks, conversely, have to interact with all the world's data and provide all the services that blockchains don't provide, right?"}, {"time": 7887, "text": "So there's kind of a spectrum."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains that are highly secure, highly reliable, highly tamper proof, highly transparent, but are not very feature rich."}, {"time": 7898, "text": "For example, they cannot talk to an API."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Many of them can't generate randomness."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "They cannot do some kind of privacy preserving computation."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "So they're very secure."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "And there are these kind of data structures and smart contract platforms to hold on chain code that can define conditions, receive value, pay value back out under conditions and create transparency around all that, which makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 7923, "text": "And then there's oracles and oracle networks."}, {"time": 7926, "text": "That is all the world's data, right?"}, {"time": 7928, "text": "We're talking about taking all the world's data and making it consumable for all the world's use cases that have trust issues."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive, right?"}, {"time": 7940, "text": "It's like the decentralized oracle network and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network needs to meet is gonna vary very widely from an insurance contract to a lending contract to an ad network contract to the data sales contract that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network to flexibly address all of those requirements is what's necessary."}, {"time": 7969, "text": "So flexibility is the goal, whereas with on chain like Bitcoin, flexibility is the enemy in the sense that you want security, you want the focus there."}, {"time": 7983, "text": "And in that kind of world, design decisions have huge consequences."}, {"time": 7988, "text": "And then if you look at the distributed oracle network side, you want to remove the restrictions of design choices."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "You want to provide maximal flexibility then."}, {"time": 7999, "text": "So it's a completely separate kind of a design framework."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "It's a slightly different problem, right?"}, {"time": 8005, "text": "Because we're not trying to define transaction types fitting into blocks on a certain timeline of those blocks being generated."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "We're trying to say, hey, there's this world of services or this world of data that's not very deterministic, but it's unbelievably useful to these smart contracts over here."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "And actually they need it to even exist."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "And we really want them to exist because once they exist, it's gonna completely redefine what our whole industry is known for, right?"}, {"time": 8028, "text": "And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg."}, {"time": 8031, "text": "They're like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "And so our goal is to create a framework and an infrastructure and a software that allows people to compose decentralized oracle networks, right?"}, {"time": 8044, "text": "So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network of seven nodes that goes to three data sources to trigger your contract worth a million dollars."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "And that's where you could start."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And then let's say your smart contract, your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars."}, {"time": 8059, "text": "Well, then you need to make some changes, right?"}, {"time": 8061, "text": "You need to go from seven nodes to 15 or maybe 31 nodes."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "And you need to go from three data sources to five or seven."}, {"time": 8069, "text": "And you maybe need to create some kind of what we call circuit breakers and some other checks."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "And you need to make sure that the decentralized oracle network comes to consensus around those checks."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "Because now the centralized oracle network isn't controlling a million dollars, it's controlling a billion dollars."}, {"time": 8085, "text": "And we have decentralized oracle networks that control well over a billion dollars, multiple billions of dollars."}, {"time": 8090, "text": "And we see them growing and getting more advanced data sources and more advanced features."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "And then if somebody else comes and says, well, I don't really wanna make a DeFi product, I wanna make crop insurance."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "And I have a completely different set of conditions."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "I want this method of consensus and I want data to be aggregated in this way, but not the way that you do for decentralized financial products."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?"}, {"time": 8110, "text": "We're supposed to tell them, no, our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that."}, {"time": 8115, "text": "And you can go and wait another five years until somebody builds it for you."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "That's not what we wanna do, right?"}, {"time": 8123, "text": "What we wanna do is be able to say, absolutely, here's an example of how somebody else made a decentralized oracle network for weather insurance."}, {"time": 8134, "text": "Here's a template, change that template, evolve it to meet your needs."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "And then someone else comes and says, hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?"}, {"time": 8144, "text": "I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events, or I wanna do whatever I wanna do with some kind of sports related data."}, {"time": 8152, "text": "Wonderful, here's the framework, here are your risk dynamics, here's a collection of node operators, here's a set of preintegrated data sources, here's a reputation system to assess the quality of your ensemble of nodes, here's a way to scale that up as the value in your contract scales."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "Here's all the tools that you need to build this contract."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "And what we actually see now as there are multiple types of computations and data sources that are provided by different decentralized oracle networks, of which there are now hundreds, we now see that a single hybrid smart contract might use multiple decentralized oracle networks."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "So there might be a hybrid smart contract that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network, a proof of reserve oracle network, a randomness oracle network."}, {"time": 8203, "text": "And I think we're gonna continue to see this dynamic that more and more advanced contracts compose various decentralized oracle networks into more advanced use cases."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "And this is the dynamic that we're focused on enabling."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "And I think it's actually a very virtuous cycle for everybody because the more of these hybrid smart contracts we enable on Ethereum and other blockchains, the more our industry provides real world outcomes to the market."}, {"time": 8235, "text": "To the larger world, which is at the end of the day, what I think everybody in our industry wants."}, {"time": 8241, "text": "Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts to become the way that global finance works, global trade works, global insurance products work, because they will inherently need both a blockchain on which the contract itself lives and an oracle network that powers all of the other interactions, right?"}, {"time": 8261, "text": "As a developer, how would you recommend somebody listening to this, but also me, to get started with smart contracts and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?"}, {"time": 8277, "text": "Well, for hybrid smart contracts, I'm gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "Please, let me twist your arm."}, {"time": 8286, "text": "I think you can go to our YouTube."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "We have a number of developer tutorials."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "Chainlink YouTube?"}, {"time": 8292, "text": "Yeah, Chainlink."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube, you should find it."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon where we had a huge amount of very kind of advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "Is that something that people can follow along like a video or there's web page traces of what happened?"}, {"time": 8315, "text": "Or is there a future actual hackathons that people could literally participate in?"}, {"time": 8319, "text": "There's plenty of more hackathons coming up."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "We wanna enable as many developers in web3 and web2 to build hybrid smart contracts as a way to redefine our industry and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "There are definitely gonna be more hackathons."}, {"time": 8334, "text": "So people should go and preregister or register on a list to get involved in that."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "That's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers and a lot of educational tools."}, {"time": 8341, "text": "They happen over a course of weeks, not days."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "So there's a long time for people to work on these things at the speed that they find comfortable."}, {"time": 8350, "text": "One, is there a kind of hello world entry point for hybrid smart contracts?"}, {"time": 8357, "text": "And two, on the hackathon side, what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?"}, {"time": 8362, "text": "Just kind of getting their feet wet in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled."}, {"time": 8368, "text": "I mean, there's unbelievable things that we see people building."}, {"time": 8372, "text": "I think how to get your feet wet, I think the hello world is probably DeFi because it's pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "And there's a large amount of data sources that we already have putting data on chain on test net, which is the test environment in which people would build."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree the most exciting for certain people and pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials and the amount of contracts to see how people have already built it."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "I think beyond that, we see people building amazing things at these hackathons."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "In the previous hackathon, we saw somebody build a smart contract that allows someone to rent out their Tesla."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access and rent out someone's Tesla on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating payment, which was kind of amazing."}, {"time": 8422, "text": "The more recent hackathon, we saw something called Dbridge, which is a cross chain solution that uses Oracle networks to confirm data on different chains."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "So I think the things that people build will just become expansive and varied in ways that I can't even imagine."}, {"time": 8440, "text": "But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list of different kind of winners in different categories."}, {"time": 8448, "text": "And there's so many different categories."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "We even have a GovTech category and a whole bunch of things."}, {"time": 8453, "text": "If people wanna see what's possible, they can go look at the winners."}, {"time": 8455, "text": "I think that's probably a good idea."}, {"time": 8459, "text": "Yeah, that'll be on the side of the hackathon."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "There's a blog related to that, and we're gonna have more of these."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "And once again, our explicit goal is to take our industry into this world of hybrid smart contracts, which just benefits everybody."}, {"time": 8474, "text": "It makes more on chain activity."}, {"time": 8476, "text": "It helps provide real world value to the average person from all of this infrastructure period."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "And at the end of the day, I think that it just redefines what our industry is about through use cases, right?"}, {"time": 8489, "text": "Because if you only learn through our industry from the point of view of a single use case, like the NFT use case or some other use case, that's what our industry is about."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "And the more of these use cases that people can make available to the average person or to the FinTech world or to the insurance world or wherever, the faster our industry will not just be about Bitcoins or tokens, it will be about changing global finance, changing global insurance, changing global trade."}, {"time": 8518, "text": "And that's the change in the world that I and a lot of other people in this industry, I think, got into this for."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "Now it's funny, you've mentioned about, you've had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin and Ethereum as important technology that paved the way for the future."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "And you somehow did not mention one of the most profound pieces of technology, which is Dogecoin."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "What are your thoughts about

and then it's kind of taken on a life of its own."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "I don't fully understand exactly why it's taken on a life of its own at this point."}, {"time": 8581, "text": "I once again, I don't spend too much time thinking about different tokens and how they're evolving."}, {"time": 8587, "text": "I'm much more focused on the launching and..."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "The technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas."}, {"time": 8595, "text": "But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin is how technology that leverages social dynamics, that technology's ability to utilize fun and memes to spread."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "I think it's really interesting."}, {"time": 8611, "text": "I don't think it should be discounted as a..."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "I think I tweeted today something about like the fundamental force field of fun."}, {"time": 8621, "text": "That fun has an effect on the space time."}, {"time": 8625, "text":

with you."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "The question points to a direction."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "The answer might be able to be more precise than the question, because just as you're saying, there

let's assign the word life to this kind of matter."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "I agree with that completely, that's what that's, but that's, so it's not a disagreement."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "It's very frequent in physics that, or in science, that words that are in common use get refined and reprocessed into scientific terms that's happened for things like force and energy."}, {"time": 3155,

it possible that there are certain kinds of matter would be able to classify as conscious, meaning like, so there's the panpsychists, right, who are the philosophers who kind of try to imply that all

asking that question, just as you said now, is what is the simplest formulation of that to study?"}, {"time": 3319, "text": "I think I'm much more comfortable with the idea of studying self awareness

ideas about feedback."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So if you have a system that looks at its own state and responds to it, that's a kind of self awareness."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "And more

also be done in neural nets."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "This is called recurrent neural nets, which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So I think understanding

the whole thing."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "So there's, from a robotics perspective, you can engineer things that exhibit qualities of consciousness without understanding how things work."}, {"time":

close together."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "That's connected through relativity with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly at high energies."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "So if you have, so

energy accelerators, it's all obvious."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "So we would have had a much, well, somebody would have had a much easier time 20 years later, looking at the data, you can sort of see the quarks and gluons."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "As I mentioned, they leave these short tracks that would have been much, much easier, but from fundamental, from indirect clues, we were able to piece

extra dimensions out there would have on the things we can perceive."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "Like what else can you do, right?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And in some sense, if the answer is they would have no effect, then maybe it becomes like a little bit of a sterile question, because what question are you even asking, right?"}, {"time": 2629, "text": "You can kind of posit however many entities that you want."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "Is it possible to intuit how to mess with the other dimensions while living in a three dimensional world?"}, {"time": 2640, "text": "I mean, that seems like a very challenging thing to do."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "The reason flatland could be written is because it's coming from a three dimensional writer."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "Yes, but what happens in the book, I didn't even tell you the whole plot."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "What happens is the square is so excited and so filled with intellectual joy."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "By the way, maybe to give the story some context, you asked like, is it possible for us humans to have this experience of being transcendentally jerked out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above?"}, {"time": 2670, "text": "Well, Edwin Abbott who wrote the book certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "So the whole Christian subtext of this book, I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid, that it means a very different thing, right?"}, {"time": 2683, "text": "If sort of a theologian is saying like, oh, what if a higher being could like pull you out of this earthly world you live in so that you can sort of see the truth and like really see it from above as it were."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "So that's one of the things that's going on for him."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "And it's a testament to his skill as a writer that his story just works whether that's the framework you're coming to it from or not."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "But what happens in this book and this part, now looking at it through a Christian lens, it becomes a bit subversive is the square is so excited about what he's learned from the sphere and the sphere explains to him like what a cube would be."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Oh, it's like you but three dimensional and the square is very excited and the square is like, okay, I get it now."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "So like now that you explained to me how just by reason I can figure out what a cube would be like, like a three dimensional version of me, like let's figure out what a four dimensional version of me would be like."}, {"time": 2732, "text": "And then the sphere is like, what the hell are you talking about?"}, {"time": 2734, "text": "There's no fourth dimension, that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Like there's three dimensions, like that's how many there are, I can see."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Like, I mean, it's this sort of comic moment where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize that there could actually be yet another dimension."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "So yeah, that takes the religious allegory like a very weird place that I don't really like understand theologically, but."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "That's a nice way to talk about religion and myth in general as perhaps us trying to struggle, us meaning human civilization, trying to struggle with ideas that are beyond our cognitive capabilities."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "But it's in fact not beyond our capability."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "It may be beyond our cognitive capabilities to visualize a four dimensional cube, a tesseract as some like to call it, or a five dimensional cube, or a six dimensional cube, but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities to figure out how many corners a six dimensional cube would have."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "That's what's so cool about us."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Whether we can visualize it or not, we can still talk about it, we can still reason about it, we can still figure things out about it."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Yeah, if we go back to this, first of all, to the mug, but to the example you give in the book of the straw, how many holes does a straw have?"}, {"time": 2809, "text": "And you, listener, may try to answer that in your own head."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "Yeah, I'm gonna take a drink while everybody thinks about it so we can give you a moment."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "A slow sip."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe?"}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Maybe you can get very creative."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "But it's kind of interesting to each, dissecting each answer as you do in the book is quite brilliant."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "But if you could try to answer it now, think about all the options and why they may or may not be right."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Yeah, and it's one of these questions where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality and they're like, well, the answer is obvious."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people that something wonderfully comic happens, which is that everyone's like, well, it's completely obvious."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And then each person realizes that half the person, the other people in the room have a different obvious answer for the way they have."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And then people get really heated."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "People are like, I can't believe that you think it has two holes or like, I can't believe that you think it has one."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And then, you know, you really, like people really learn something about each other and people get heated."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "I mean, can we go through the possible options here?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?"}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Sure, so I think, you know, most people, the zero holders are rare."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "They would say like, well, look, you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic and closing it up."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "A rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I didn't poke a hole in it when I, so how can I have a hole?"}, {"time": 2898, "text": "They'd be like, it's just one thing."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "Okay, most people don't see it that way."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "That's like a... Is there any truth to that kind of conception?"}, {"time": 2905, "text": "Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's account, I mean, what I would say is you could say the same thing about a bagel."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "You could say, I can make a bagel by taking like a long cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole and then schmushing the ends together."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "Now it's a bagel."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay, a bagel doesn't have a hole either."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Yeah, so that's almost like an engineering definition of it."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "Okay, fair enough."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So what about the other options?"}, {"time": 2942, "text": "So, you know, one whole people would say..."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I like how these are like groups of people."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "Like we've planted our foot, this is what we stand for."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "There's books written about each belief."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "You know, I would say, look, there's like a hole and it goes all the way through the straw, right?"}, {"time": 2959, "text": "It's one region of space, that's the hole."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "And two whole people would say like, well, look, there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "I think a common thing you see when people argue about this, they would take something like this bottle of water I'm holding and go open it and they say, well, how many holes are there in this?"}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And you say like, well, there's one hole at the top."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "Okay, what if I like poke a hole here so that all the water spills out?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Well, now it's a straw."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "So if you're a one holder, I say to you like, well, how many holes are in it now?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "There was one hole in it before and I poked a new hole in it."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And then you think there's still one hole even though there was one hole and I made one more?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Clearly not, this is two holes."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "And yet if you're a two holder, the one holder will say like, okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?"}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math, there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem that's confusing us."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We can make the problem simpler."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "That's what we were doing a minute ago when we were talking about high dimensional space."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "And I was like, let's talk about like circles and line segments."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "Let's like go down a dimension to make it easier."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "The other big move we have is to make the problem harder and try to sort of really like face up to what are the complications."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So, you know, what I do in the book is say like, let's stop talking about straws for a minute and talk about pants."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "How many holes are there in a pair of pants?"}, {"time": 3046, "text": "So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "You'll just have to imagine the pants, sorry."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "That's gonna be in the director's cut."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "That's that Patreon only footage."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "So many people would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked, by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I highly recommend it."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "What did she say?"}, {"time": 3077, "text": "She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist, but that's just the two leg holes stuck together."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "Whoa, okay."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "Two leg holes, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I mean, that really is a good combination."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw too."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And that really does capture something."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "It captures this fact, which is central to the theory of what's called homology, which is like a central part of modern topology that holes, whatever we may mean by them, they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "They're things which can be added."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg is kind of an equation, but it's not an equation about numbers."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "It's an equation about some kind of geometric, some kind of topological thing, which is very strange."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "And so, you know, when I come down, you know, like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up with these answers and somehow like dodge the original question and say like, you're both right, my children."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician would say is like, the first version would be to say like, well, there are two holes, but they're really both the same hole."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "Well, that's not quite right."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "A better way to say it is there's two holes, but one is the negative of the other."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Now, what can that mean?"}, {"time": 3159, "text": "One way of thinking about what it means is that if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw, no matter what, the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end, that same amount is flowing out the other end."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "So they're not independent from each other."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "There's some relationship between them."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "In the same way that if you somehow could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants, the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this thought experiment."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "I'm right there with you."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "The amount of milkshake that's coming in the left leg of the pants, plus the amount of milkshake that's coming in the right leg of the pants, is the same that's coming out the waist of the pants."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours the last three days."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors for this podcast work wonderfully because I can intensely picture it."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation for talking about geometry for three hours?"}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Exactly, this is just for this."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "It's hardship to purify the mind."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "No, it's for the first time, I just wanted to try the experience."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "And just to pause, to do things that are out of the ordinary, to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit that I get to do, so."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "Did you drink water?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "Water and salt, so like electrolytes and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Exactly, so this idea that, I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea, this sort of modern idea."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "I mean, building on stuff other people did, Betty is an important one, of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic, the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject on its modern footing that we have now."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know, in the book, I'm not gonna say I give like a course so that you read this chapter and then you're like, oh, it's just like I took like a semester of algebraic anthropology."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It's not like this and it's always a challenge writing about math because there are some things that you can really do on the page and the math is there."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And there's other things which it's too much in a book like this to like do them all the page."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "You can only say something about them, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "I try to do, I try to, topics that are, you can't really compress and really truly say exactly what they are in this amount of space."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "I try to say something interesting about them, something meaningful about them so that readers can get the flavor."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And then in other places, I really try to get up close and personal and really do the math and have it take place on the page."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "To some degree be able to give inklings of the beauty of the subject."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like, I don't quite know how to express this well."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "I'm still laboring to do it, but there's a lot of books that are about stuff, but I want my books to not only be about stuff, but to actually have some stuff there on the page in the book for people to interact with directly and not just sort of hear me talk about distant features of it."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Right, so not be talking just about ideas, but the actually be expressing the idea."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Is there, you know, somebody in the, maybe you can comment, there's a guy, his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "He does that masterfully well."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea and then talking about it as well back and forth."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "What do you think about Grant?"}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I mean, the flowering of math YouTube is like such a wonderful thing because math teaching, there's so many different venues through which we can teach people math."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "There's the traditional one, right?"}, {"time": 3411, "text": "Where I'm in a classroom with, depending on the class, it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people, it could, God help me, be a 500 people if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And there's sort of some, but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude and I'm with them, we have a long time."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "I'm with them for a whole semester and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "We have office hours, if they have one on one questions, a lot of, it's like a very high level of engagement, but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?"}, {"time": 3437, "text": "Like not that many, right?"}, {"time": 3440, "text": "And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship where the more, the fewer people you're talking to, the more engagement you can ask for."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time together for like three to five years."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "Books, this can get to a lot more people that are ever gonna sit in my classroom and you spend like however many hours it takes to read a book."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile or people like Vi Hart."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach than a book."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than like any hardback book like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is gonna sell, right?"}, {"time": 3496, "text": "So that's, I mean, and then those are, some of them are like longer, 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long, but they're shorter."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang who's a wonderful category theorist in Chicago."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it, I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds, but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say something about mathematics to like untold millions of people."},

I sort of spent a lot of time like thinking about how to put English words together into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs, like at length, which is this kind of like weird specialized skill."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make like winning, good looking, eye catching videos is like a totally different skill."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And probably somewhere out there, there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band that's like teaching math through heavy metal and like using their skills to do that."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "I hope there is at any rate."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "Their music and so on, yeah."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But there is something to the process."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "I mean, Grant does this especially well, which is in order to be able to visualize something, now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "So like the things he is basically mostly through his Manum library and Python, everything is drawn through Python."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "You have to truly understand the topic to be able to visualize it in that way and not just understand it, but really kind of think in a very novel way."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "It's funny because I've spoken with him a couple of times, spoken to him a lot offline as well."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "He really doesn't think he's doing anything new, meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a researcher, but it feels to me like he's creating something totally new."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Like that act of understanding and visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of proving something."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "It doesn't have that clear destination, but it's pulling out an insight and creating multiple sets of perspective that arrive at that insight."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "And to be honest, it's something that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside academic mathematics in the same way, and this is a bit older, that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value the development of computational infrastructure."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "We all have computers as our partners now and people build computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "They build those systems and that's a kind of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form of proving theorems and writing papers."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "But I think it's coming."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "Look, I mean, I think, for example, the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics at Brown, which is like, it's a NSF funded math institute, very much part of sort of traditional math academia."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "They did an entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics, looking at the same kind of thing that they would do for like an up and coming research topic."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Like that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "So I think there really is buy in from the mathematics community to recognize that this kind of stuff is important and counts as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually here to do."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that from like MIT

pure mathematics."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?"}, {"time": 3760, "text": "You're like, why am I interested in like, how it can like help feed the world or help solve like real social problems?"}, {"time": 3764, "text": "I'm like, can it do more math?"}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like, what can I do?"}, {"time": 3767, "text": "We all have our

so right, so to give, let me just say the background, because I don't know if everybody listening knows the story."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "So, you know, Fermat was an early number theorist, at least sort of an early mathematician, those special adjacent didn't really exist back then."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "He comes up in the book actually, in the context of a different theorem of his

just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being the person who, together with Richard Taylor, finally proved this theorem."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "But you know how you have this whole moment that people try to prove this theorem and they fail, and there's a famous false proof by LeMay from the 19th century, where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay had made in this incorrect proof, basically

prove."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "What's amazing is the fact that you can factor a number into primes is much easier."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Essentially Euclid knew it, although he didn't quite

in machine learning kind of assume a hopeful vision that it's possible to construct a perfect taxonomy or it exists perhaps out of our reach, but we can always get closer and closer to it."}, {"time": 928, "text": "Or is that a hopeless pursuit?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "I think it's hopeless in some way."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So the thing is for any particular categorization that you create, if you have a discrete sort of categorization, I can always take the nearest two concepts or I can take a third concept and I can blend it in and I can create a new category."}, {"time": 944, "text": "So if you were to enumerate N categories, I will always find an N plus one category for you."}, {"time": 948, "text": "That's not going to be in the N categories."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And I can actually create not just N plus one, I can very easily create far more than N categories."}, {"time": 955, "text": "The thing is a lot of things we talk about are actually compositional."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So it's really hard for us to come and sit and enumerate all of these out."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And they compose in various weird ways, right?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "Like you have like a croissant and a donut come together to form a cronut."}, {"time": 969, "text": "So if you were to like enumerate all the foods up until, I don't know, whenever the cronut was about 10 years ago or 15 years ago, then this entire thing called cronut would not exist."}, {"time": 979, "text": "Yeah, I remember there was the most awesome video of a cat wearing a monkey costume."},

function, a good way to tell which parts of things are similar and which parts of things are very different."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "So you don't necessarily need to name everything or assign a name to everything to be able to use it, right?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So there are like lots of... Shakespeare said that, what's in a name?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "What's in a name, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "And I mean, lots of like, for example, animals, right?"}, {"time": 1025,

1032, "text": "So, I mean, we probably look at things and we figure out, oh, this is similar to something else that I've seen before."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And then I can probably learn how to use it."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So I haven't seen all the possible doorknobs in the world."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "But if you show me, like I was able to get into this particular place fairly easily, I've never seen that particular doorknob."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So I of course related to all the doorknobs that I've seen and I know exactly how it's going to open."}, {"time": 1056,

1091, "text": "Well, let me tell you what that's similar to."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "No, so there's an idea of sort of reasoning by analogy kind of thing."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I think understanding is the process of placing that thing in some kind of network of knowledge that you have."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "That it perhaps is fundamentally related to other concepts."},

and deeper understanding is maybe just adding more edges to that graph somehow."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So maybe it is a composition of similarities."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "I mean, ultimately, I suppose it is a kind of embedding in that wisdom space."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "Yeah, okay, wisdom space is good."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "I think, I do think, right?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So similarity does get you very, very far."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Is it the answer to everything?"}, {"time": 1152, "text": "I mean, I don't even know what everything is, but it's going to take us really far."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And I think the thing is things are similar in very different contexts, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "So an elephant is similar to, I don't know, another sort of wild animal."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Let's just pick, I don't know, lion in a different way because they're both four legged creatures."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "They're also land animals."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "But of course they're very different in a lot of different ways."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So elephants are like herbivores, lions are not."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So similarity and particularly dissimilarity also actually helps us understand a lot about things."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And so that's actually why I think discrete categorization is very hard."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Just like forming this particular category of elephant and a particular category of lion, maybe it's good for just like taxonomy, biological taxonomies."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "But when it comes to other things which are not as maybe, for example, like grilled cheese, right?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I have a grilled cheese, I dip it in tomato and I keep it outside."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Now, is that still a grilled cheese or is that something else?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Right, so categorization is still very useful for solving problems."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "But is your intuition then sort of the self supervised should be the, to borrow Jan Lekun's terminology, should be the cake and then categorization, the classification, maybe the supervised like layer should be just like the thing on top, the cherry or the icing or whatever."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So if you make it the cake, it gets in the way of learning."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "If you make it the cake, then you won't be able to sit and annotate everything."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "That's as simple as it is."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Like that's my very practical view on it."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "It's just, I mean, in my PhD, I sat down and annotated like a bunch of cards for one of my projects."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And very quickly, I was just like, it was in a video and I was basically drawing boxes around all these cards."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And I think I spent about a week doing all of that and I barely got anything done."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And basically this was, I think my first year of my PhD or like a second year of my master's."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "And then by the end of it, I'm like, okay, this is just hopeless."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I can keep doing it."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "And when I'd done that, someone came up to me and they basically told me, oh, this is a pickup truck."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "This is not a card."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And that's when like, aha, this actually makes sense because a pickup truck is not really like, what was I annotating?"}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Was I annotating anything that is mobile or was I annotating particular sedans or was I annotating SUVs?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "What was I doing?"}, {"time": 1283, "text": "By the way, the annotation was bounding boxes?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Bounding boxes, yeah."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "There's so many deep, profound questions here that you're almost cheating your way out of by doing self supervised learning, by the way, which is like, what makes for an object?"}, {"time": 1297, "text": "As opposed to solve intelligence, maybe you don't ever need to answer that question."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "I mean, this is the question that anyone that's ever done annotation because it's so painful gets to ask, like, why am I drawing very careful line around this object?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Like, what is the value?"}, {"time": 1317, "text": "I remember when I first saw semantic segmentation where you have like instant segmentation where you have a very exact line around the object in a 2D plane of a fundamentally 3D object projected on a 2D plane."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So you're drawing a line around a car that might be occluded."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "There might be another thing in front of it, but you're still drawing the line of the part of the car that you see."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "How is that the car?"}, {"time": 1345, "text": "Why is that the car?"}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Like, I had like an existential crisis every time."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Like, how's that going to help us

that self supervised learning can take us far."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Can I ask you just an out there question?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "I remember, I think Andre Karpathy had a blog post about computer vision, like being really hard."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "I forgot what the title was, but it was many, many years ago."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And he had, I think President Obama stepping on a scale and there was humor and there was a bunch of people laughing and whatever."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And there's a lot of interesting things about that image and I think Andre highlighted a bunch of things about the image that us humans are able to immediately understand."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Like the idea, I think of gravity and that you have the concept of a weight."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "You immediately project because of our knowledge of pose and how human bodies are constructed, you understand how the forces are being applied with the human body."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "The really interesting other thing that you're able to understand, there's multiple people looking at each other in the image."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "You're able to have a mental model of what the people are thinking about."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "You're able to infer like, oh, this person is probably thinks, like is laughing at how humorous the situation is."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "And this person is confused about what the situation is because they're looking this way."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "We're able to infer all of that."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So that's human vision."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "How difficult is computer vision?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Like in order to achieve that level of understanding and maybe how big of a part does self supervised learning play in that, do you think?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And do you still, you know, back, that was like over a decade ago, I think Andre and I think a lot of people agreed is computer vision is really hard."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Do you still think computer vision is really hard?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "I think it is, yes."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And getting to that kind of understanding, I mean, it's really out there."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "So if you ask me to solve just that particular problem, I can do it the supervised learning route."},

1529, "text": "To some extent, yes."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "I'm sure it will work."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "I mean, it won't be as bad as like randomly guessing."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "I'm sure it can still predict whether it's humorous or not in some way."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Yeah, maybe like Reddit upvotes is the signal."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "I mean, it won't do a great job, but it'll do something."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "It may actually be like, it may find certain things which are not humorous, humorous as well, which is going to be bad for us."}, {"time": 1549,

that particular problem, yes."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "But the general problem you're saying is hard."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "The general problem is hard."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And I mean, self supervised learning is not the answer to everything."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Of course it's not."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "I think if you have machines that are going to communicate with humans at the end of it, you want to understand what the algorithm is doing, right?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "You want it to be able to produce an output that you can decipher, that you can understand, or it's actually useful for something else, which again is a human."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So at some point in this sort of entire loop, a human steps in."}, {"time": 1583, "text":

machine just spits out something and if we can't understand it, then it's not really that useful for us."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So self supervised learning is probably going to be useful for a lot of the things before that part, before the machine really needs to communicate a particular kind of output with a human."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Because, I mean, otherwise, how is it going to do that without language?"}, {"time": 1609, "text": "Or some kind of communication."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "But you're saying that it's possible to build a big base of understanding or whatever, of what's a better?"}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Of concepts."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Concepts, yeah."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Like common sense concepts."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Supervised learning in the context of computer vision is something you've focused on, but that's a really hard domain."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And it's kind of the cutting edge of what we're, as a community, working on today."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "Can we take a little bit of a step back and look at language?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Can you summarize the history of success of self supervised learning in natural language processing, language modeling?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "What are transformers?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "What is the masking, the sentence completion that you mentioned before?"}, {"time": 1651, "text": "How does it lead us to understand anything?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Semantic meaning of words, syntactic role of words and sentences?"}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So I'm, of course, not the expert on NLP."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "I kind of follow it a little bit from the sides."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So the main sort of reason why all of this masking stuff works is, I think it's called the distributional hypothesis in NLP."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "The idea basically being that words that occur in the same context should have similar meaning."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "So if you have the blank jumped over the blank, it basically, whatever is like in the first blank is basically an object that can actually jump, is going to be something that can jump."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "So a cat or a dog, or I don't know, sheep, something, all of these things can basically be in that particular context."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And now, so essentially the idea is that if you have words that are in the same context and you predict them, you're going to learn lots of useful things about how words are related, because you're predicting by looking at their context where the word is going to be."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "So in this particular case, the blank jumped over the fence."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So now if it's a sheep, the sheep jumped over the fence, the dog jumped over the fence."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "So essentially the algorithm or the representation basically puts together these two concepts together."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So it says, okay, dogs are going to be kind of related to sheep because both of them occur in the same context."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "Of course, now you can decide depending on your particular application downstream, you can say that dogs are absolutely not related to sheep because well, I don't, I really care about dog food, for example, I'm a dog food person and I really want to give this dog food to this particular animal."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "So depending on what your downstream application is, of course, this notion of similarity or this notion or this common sense that you've learned may not be applicable."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "But the point is basically that this, just predicting what the blanks are is going to take you really, really far."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "So there's a nice feature of language that the number of words in a particular language is very large, but it's finite and it's actually not that large in the grand scheme of things."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "I still got it because we take it for granted."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "So first of all, when you say masking, you're talking about this very process of the blank, of removing words from a sentence and then having the knowledge of what word went there in the initial data set, that's the ground truth that you're training on and then you're asking the neural network to predict what goes there."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "That's like a little trick."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "It's a really powerful trick."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "The question is how far that takes us."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And the other question is, is there other tricks?"}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Because to me, it's very possible there's other very fascinating tricks."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "I'll give you an example in autonomous driving, there's a bunch of tricks that give you the self supervised signal back."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "For example, very similar to sentences, but not really, which is you have signals from humans driving the car because a lot of us drive cars to places."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "And so you can ask the neural network to predict what's going to happen the next two seconds for a safe navigation through the environment."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "And the signal comes from the fact that you also have knowledge of what happened in the next two seconds, because you have video of the data."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "The question in autonomous driving, as it is in language, can we learn how to drive autonomously based on that kind of self supervision?"}, {"time": 1853, "text": "Probably the answer is no."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "The question is how good can we get?"}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And the same with language, how good can we get?"}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And are there other tricks?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Like we get sometimes super excited by this trick that works really well."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "But I wonder, it's almost like mining for gold."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "I wonder how many signals there are in the data that could be leveraged that are like there."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "I just wanted to kind of linger on that because sometimes it's easy to think that maybe this masking process is self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "No, it's only one method."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "So there could be many, many other methods, many tricky methods, maybe interesting ways to leverage human computation in very interesting ways that might actually border on semi supervised learning, something like that."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "Obviously the internet is generated by humans at the end of the day."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "So all that to say is what's your sense in this particular context of language, how far can that masking process take us?"}, {"time": 1914, "text": "So it has stood the test of time, right?"}, {"time": 1916, "text": "I mean, so Word2vec, the initial sort of NLP technique that was using this to now, for example, like all the BERT and all these big models that we get, BERT and Roberta, for example, all of them are still sort of based on the same principle of masking."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "It's taken us really far."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "I mean, you can actually do things like, oh, these two sentences are similar or not, whether this particular sentence follows this other sentence in terms of logic, so entailment, you can do a lot of these things with just this masking trick."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So I'm not sure if I can predict how far it can take us, because when it first came out, when Word2vec was out, I don't think a lot of us would have imagined that this would actually help us do some kind of entailment problems and really that well."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And so just the fact that by just scaling up the amount of data that we're training on and using better and more powerful neural network architectures has taken us from that to this, is just showing you how maybe poor predictors we are, as humans, how poor we are at predicting how successful a particular technique is going to be."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "So I think I can say something now, but like 10 years from now, I look completely stupid basically predicting this."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "In the language domain, is there something in your work that you find useful and insightful and transferable to computer vision, but also just, I don't know, beautiful and profound that I think carries through to the vision domain?"}, {"time": 1998, "text": "I mean, the idea of masking has been very powerful."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "It has been used in vision as well for predicting, like you say, the next sort of if you have and sort of frames and you predict what's going to happen in the next frame."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "So that's been very powerful."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "In terms of modeling, like in just terms in terms of architecture, I think you would have asked about transformers a while back."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "That has really become like, it has become super exciting for computer vision now."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "Like in the past, I would say year and a half, it's become really powerful."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "What's a transformer?"}, {"time": 2026, "text": "I mean, the core part of a transformer is something called the self attention model."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "So it came out of Google and the idea basically is that if you have N elements, what you're creating is a way for all of these N elements to talk to each other."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "So the idea basically is that you are paying attention."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Each element is paying attention to each of the other element."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And basically by doing this, it's really trying to figure out, you're basically getting a much better view of the data."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "So for example, if you have a sentence of like four words, the point is if you get a representation or a feature for this entire sentence, it's constructed in a way such that each word has paid attention to everything else."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "Now, the reason it's like different from say, what you would do in a ConvNet is basically that in the ConvNet, you would only pay attention to a local window."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "So each word would only pay attention to its next neighbor or like one neighbor after that."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "And the same thing goes for images."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "In images, you would basically pay attention to pixels in a three cross three or a seven cross seven neighborhood."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "Whereas with the transformer, the self attention mainly, the sort of idea is that each element needs to pay attention to each other element."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And when you say attention, maybe another way to phrase that is you're considering a context, a wide context in terms of the wide context of the sentence in understanding the meaning of a particular word and in computer vision that's understanding a larger context to understand the local pattern of a particular local part of an image."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "Right, so basically if you have say, again, a banana in the image, you're looking at the full image first."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So whether it's like, you know, you're looking at all the pixels that are off a kitchen or for dining table and so on."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "And then you're basically looking at the banana also."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "Yeah, by the way, in terms of, if we were to train the funny classifier, there's something funny about the word banana."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "Just wanted to anticipate that."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "I am wearing a banana shirt, so yeah."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "Is there bananas on it?"}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Okay, so masking has worked for the vision context as well."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And so this transformer idea has worked as well."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "So basically looking at all the elements to understand a particular element has been really powerful in vision."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "The reason is like a lot of things when you're looking at them in isolation."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So if you look at just a blob of pixels, so Antonio Torralba at MIT used to have this like really famous image, which I looked at when I was a PhD student."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "But he would basically have a blob of pixels and he would ask you, hey, what is this?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And it looked basically like a shoe or like it could look like a TV remote."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It could look like anything."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And it turns out it was a beer bottle."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "But I'm not sure it was one of these three things, but basically he showed you the full picture and then it was very obvious what it was."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "But the point is just by looking at that particular local window, you couldn't figure it out."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "Because of resolution, because of other things, it's just not easy always to just figure it out by looking at just the neighborhood of pixels, what these pixels are."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And the same thing happens for language as well."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "For the parameters that have to learn something about the data, you need to give it the capacity to learn the essential things."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Like if it's not actually able to receive the signal at all, then it's not gonna be able to learn that signal."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And in order to understand images, to understand language, you have to be able to see words in their full context."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Okay, what is harder to solve, vision or language?"}, {"time": 2214, "text": "Visual intelligence or linguistic intelligence?"}, {"time": 2217, "text": "So I'm going to say computer vision is harder."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "My reason for this is basically that language of course has a big structure to it because we developed it."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "Whereas vision is something that is common in a lot of animals."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Everyone is able to get by a lot of these animals on earth are actually able to get by without language."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "And a lot of these animals we also deem to be intelligent."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "So clearly intelligence does have like a visual component to it."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And yes, of course, in the case of humans, it of course also has a linguistic component."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But it means that there is something far more fundamental about vision than there is about language."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "And I'm sorry to anyone who disagrees, but yes, this is what I feel."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So that's being a little bit reflected in the challenges that have to do with the progress of self supervised learning, would you say?"}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Or is that just a peculiar accidents of the progress of the AI community that we focused on like, or we discovered self attention and transformers in the context of language first?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "So like the self supervised learning success was actually for vision has not much to do with the transformers part."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "I would say it's actually been independent a little bit."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "I think it's just that the signal was a little bit different for vision than there was for like NLP and probably NLP folks discovered it before."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "So for vision, the main success has basically been this like crops so far, like taking different crops of images."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "Whereas for NLP, it was this masking thing."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "But also the level of success is still much higher for language."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So that has a lot to do with, I mean, I can get into a lot of details."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "For this particular question, let's go for it, okay."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So the first thing is language is very structured."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So you are going to produce a distribution over a finite vocabulary."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "English has a finite number of words."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "It's actually not that large."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And you need to produce basically, when you're doing this masking thing, all you need to do is basically tell me which one of these like 50,000 words it is."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Now for vision, let's imagine doing the same thing."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "Okay, we're basically going to blank out a particular part of the image and we ask the network or this neural network to predict what is present in this missing patch."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "It's combinatorially large, right?"}, {"time": 2339, "text": "You have 256 pixel values."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "If you're even producing basically a seven cross seven or a 14 cross 14 like window of pixels, at each of these 169 or each of these 49 locations, you have 256 values to predict."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "And so it's really, really large."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "And very quickly, the kind of like prediction problems that we're setting up are going to be extremely like interactable for us."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "And so the thing is for NLP, it has been really successful because we are very good at predicting, like doing this like distribution over a finite set."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And the problem is when this set becomes really large, we are going to become really, really bad at making these predictions and at solving basically this particular set of problems."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "So if you were to do it exactly in the same way as NLP for vision, there is very limited success."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "The way stuff is working right now is actually not by predicting these masks."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "It's basically by saying that you take these two like crops from the image, you get a feature representation from it."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "And just saying that these two features, so they're like vectors, just saying that the distance between these vectors should be small."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "And so it's a very different way of learning from the visual signal than there is from NLP."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "Okay, the other reason is the distributional hypothesis that we talked about for NLP, right?"}, {"time": 2412, "text": "So a word given its context, basically the context actually supplies a lot of meaning to the word."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "Now, because there are just finite number of words and there is a finite way in like which we compose them."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "Of course, the same thing holds for pixels, but in language, there's a lot of structure, right?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "So I always say whatever, the dash jumped over the fence, for example."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "There are lots of these sentences that you'll get."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "And from this, you can actually look at this particular sentence might occur in a lot of different contexts as well."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "This exact same sentence might occur in a different context."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "So the sheep jumped over the fence, the cat jumped over the fence, the dog jumped over the fence."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So you immediately get a lot of these words, which are because this particular token itself has so much meaning, you get a lot of these tokens or these words, which are actually going to have sort of this related meaning across given this context."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "Whereas for vision, it's much harder because just by like pure, like the way we capture images, lighting can be different."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "There might be like different noise in the sensor."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So the thing is you're capturing a physical phenomenon and then you're basically going through a very complicated pipeline of like image processing."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "And then you're translating that into some kind of like digital signal."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "Whereas with language, you write it down and you transfer it to a digital signal, almost like it's a lossless like transfer."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "And each of these tokens are very, very well defined."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "There could be a little bit of an argument there because language as written down is a projection of thought."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "This is one of the open questions is if you perfectly can solve language, are you getting close to being able to solve easily with flying colors past the towing test kind of thing."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So that's, it's similar, but different and the computer vision problem is in the 2D plane is a projection with three dimensional world."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So perhaps there are similar problems there."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "Maybe this is a good."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "I mean, I think what I'm saying is NLP is not easy."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Of course, don't get me wrong."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "Like abstract thought expressed in knowledge or knowledge basically expressed in language is really hard to understand, right?"}, {"time": 2536, "text": "I mean, we've been communicating with language for so long and it is of course a very complicated concept."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "The thing is at least getting like somewhat reasonable, like being able to solve some kind of reasonable tasks with language, I would say slightly easier than it is with computer vision."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Yeah, I would say, yeah."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "So that's well put."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "I would say getting impressive performance on language is easier."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "I feel like for both language and computer vision, there's going to be this wall of like, like this hump you have to overcome to achieve superhuman level performance or human level performance."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And I feel like for language, that wall is farther away."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So you can get pretty nice."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "You can do a lot of tricks."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "You can show really impressive performance."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "You can even fool people that you're tweeting or you write blog posts writing or your question answering has intelligence behind it."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "But to truly demonstrate understanding of dialogue, of continuous long form dialogue that would require perhaps big breakthroughs."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "In the same way in computer vision, I think the big breakthroughs need to happen earlier to achieve impressive performance."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "This might be a good place to, you already mentioned it, but what is contrastive learning and what are energy based models?"}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Contrastive learning is sort of the paradigm of learning where the idea is that you are learning this embedding space or so you're learning this sort of vector space of all your concepts."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "And the way you learn that is basically by contrasting."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "So the idea is that you have a sample, you have another sample that's related to it."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "So that's called the positive and you have another sample that's not related to it."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "So that's negative."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "So for example, let's just take an NLP or in a simple example in computer vision."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So you have an image of a cat, you have an image of a dog and for whatever application that you're doing, say you're trying to figure out what the pets are, you're saying that these two images are related."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So image of a cat and dog are related, but now you have another third image of a banana because you don't like that word."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "So now you basically have this banana."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "Thank you for speaking to the crowd."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "And so you take both of these images and you take the image from the cat, the image from the dog, you get a feature from both of them."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "And now what you're training the network to do is basically pull both of these features together while pushing them away from the feature of a banana."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So this is the contrastive part."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "So you're contrasting against the banana."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "So there's always this notion of a negative and a positive."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "Now, energy based models are like one way that Jan sort of explains a lot of these methods."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "So Jan basically, I think a couple of years or more than that, like when I joined Facebook, Jan used to keep mentioning this word, energy based models."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "And of course I had no idea what he was talking about."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "So then one day I caught him in one of the conference rooms and I'm like, can you please tell me what this is?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "So then like very patiently, he sat down with like a marker and a whiteboard."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "And his idea basically is that rather than talking about probability distributions, you can talk about energies of models."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "So models are trying to minimize certain energies in certain space, or they're trying to maximize a certain kind of energy."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "And the idea basically is that you can explain a lot of the contrastive models, GANs, for example, which are like Generative Adversarial Networks."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "A lot of these modern learning methods or VAEs, which are Variational Autoencoders, you can really explain them very nicely in terms of an energy function that they're trying to minimize or maximize."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And so by putting this common sort of language for all of these models, what looks very different in machine learning that, oh, VAEs are very different from what GANs are, are very, very different from what contrastive models are, you actually get a sense of like, oh, these are actually very, very related."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "It's just that the way or the mechanism in which they're sort of maximizing or minimizing this energy function is slightly different."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "It's revealing the commonalities between all these approaches and putting a sexy word on top of it, like energy."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "And so similarities, two things that are similar have low energy."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "Like the low energy signifying similarity."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "So basically the idea is that if you were to imagine like the embedding as a manifold, a 2D manifold, you would get a hill or like a high sort of peak in the energy manifold, wherever two things are not related."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "And basically you would have like a dip where two things are related."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So you'd get a dip in the manifold."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And in the self supervised context, how do you know two things are related and two things are not related?"}, {"time": 2804, "text": "So this is where all the sort of ingenuity or tricks comes in, right?"}, {"time": 2807, "text": "So for example, like you can take the fill in the blank problem, or you can take in the context problem."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "And what you can say is two words that are in the same context are related."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Two words that are in different contexts are not related."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "For images, basically two crops from the same image are related."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And whereas a third image is not related at all."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "Or for a video, it can be two frames from that video are related because they're likely to contain the same sort of concepts in them."}, {"time": 2832, "text": "Whereas a third frame from a different video is not related."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "So it basically is, it's a very general term."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "Contrastive learning is nothing really to do with self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "It actually is very popular in for example, like any kind of metric learning or any kind of embedding learning."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So it's also used in supervised learning."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "And the thing is because we are not really using labels to get these positive or negative pairs, it can basically also be used for self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So you mentioned one of the ideas in the vision context that works is to have different crops."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So you could think of that as a way to sort of manipulating the data to generate examples that are similar."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Obviously, there's a bunch of other techniques."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "You mentioned lighting as a very, in images lighting is something that varies a lot and you can artificially change those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "There's the whole broad field of data augmentation, which manipulates images in order to increase arbitrarily the size of the data set."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "First of all, what is data augmentation?"}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And second of all, what's the role of data augmentation in self supervised learning and contrastive learning?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "So data augmentation is just a way like you said, it's basically a way to augment the data."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So you have say n samples."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "And what you do is you basically define some kind of transforms for the sample."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So you take your say image and then you define a transform where you can just increase say the colors like the colors or the brightness of the image or increase or decrease the contrast of the image for example, or take different crops of it."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So data augmentation is just a process to like basically perturb the data or like augment the data, right?"}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And so it has played a fundamental role for computer vision for self supervised learning especially."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "The way most of the current methods work contrastive or otherwise is by taking an image in the case of images is by taking an image and then computing basically two perturbations of it."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So these can be two different crops of the image with like different types of lighting or different contrast or different colors."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "So you jitter the colors a little bit and so on."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "And now the idea is basically because it's the same object or because it's like related concepts in both of these perturbations, you want the features from both of these perturbations to be similar."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "So now you can use a variety of different ways to enforce this constraint, like these features being similar."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "You can do this by contrastive learning."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "So basically, both of these things are positives, a third sort of image is negative."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "You can do this basically by like clustering."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "For example, you can say that both of these images should, the features from both of these images should belong in the same cluster because they're related, whereas image like another image should belong to a different cluster."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "So there's a variety of different ways to basically enforce this particular constraint."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "By the way, when you say features, it means there's a very large neural network that extracting patterns from the image and the kind of patterns that extracts should be either identical or very similar."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "That's what that means."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So the neural network basically takes in the image and then outputs a set of like, basically a vector of like numbers, and that's the feature."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And you want this feature for both of these like different crops that you computed to be similar."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "So you want this vector to be identical in its like entries, for example."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Be like literally close in this multi dimensional space to each other."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "And like you said, close can mean part of the same cluster or something like that in this large space."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "First of all, that, I wonder if there is connection to the way humans learn to this, almost like maybe subconsciously, in order to understand a thing, you kind of have to see it from two, three multiple angles."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "I wonder, I have a lot of friends who are neuroscientists maybe and cognitive scientists."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "I wonder if that's in there somewhere."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Like in order for us to place a concept in its proper place, we have to basically crop it in all kinds of ways, do basic data augmentation on it in whatever very clever ways that the brain likes to do."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Like spinning around in our minds somehow that that is very effective."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "So I think for some of them, we like need to do it."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "So like babies, for example, pick up objects, like move them and put them close to their eye and whatnot."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "But for certain other things, actually we are good at imagining it as well, right?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So if you, I have never seen, for example, an elephant from the top."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "I've never basically looked at it from like top down."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "But if you showed me a picture of it, I could very well tell you that that's an elephant."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So I think some of it, we're just like, we naturally build it or transfer it from other objects that we've seen to imagine what it's going to look like."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Has anyone done that with augmentation?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like imagine all the possible things that are occluded or not there, but not just like normal things, like wild things, but they're nevertheless physically consistent."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "So, I mean, people do kind of like occlusion based augmentation as well."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "So you place in like a random like box, gray box to sort of mask out a certain part of the image."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "And the thing is basically you're kind of occluding it."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "For example, you place it say on half of a person's face."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So basically saying that, you know, something below their nose is occluded because it's grayed out."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "So, you know, I meant like, you have like, what is it?"}, {"time": 3151, "text": "A table and you can't see behind the table."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "And you imagine there's a bunch of elves with bananas behind the table."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Like, I wonder if there's useful to have a wild imagination for the network because that's possible or maybe not elves, but like puppies and kittens or something like that."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "Just have a wild imagination and like constantly be generating that wild imagination."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "Because in terms of data augmentation, as currently applied, it's super ultra, very boring."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "It's very basic data augmentation."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "I wonder if there's a benefit to being wildly imaginable while trying to be consistent with physical reality."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "I think it's a kind of a chicken and egg problem, right?"}, {"time": 3194, "text": "Because to have like amazing data augmentation, you need to understand what the scene is."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And what we're trying to do data augmentation to learn what a scene is anyway."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "So it's basically just keeps going on."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "Before you understand it, just put elves with bananas until you know it's not to be true."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "Just like children have a wild imagination until the adults ruin it all."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "Okay, so what are the different kinds of data augmentation that you've seen to be effective in visual intelligence?"}, {"time": 3220, "text": "For like vision, it's a lot of these image filtering operations."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So like blurring the image, you know, all the kind of Instagram filters that you can think of."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "So like arbitrarily like make the red super red, make the green super greens, like saturate the image."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "Rotation, cropping."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "Rotation, cropping, exactly."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "All of these kinds of things."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "Like I said, lighting is a really interesting one to me."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Like that feels like really complicated to do."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "I mean, they don't, the augmentations that we work on aren't like that involved, they're not going to be like physically realistic versions of lighting."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "It's not that you're assuming that there's a light source up and then you're moving it to the right and then what does the thing look like?"}, {"time": 3257, "text": "It's really more about like brightness of the image, overall brightness of the image or overall contrast of the image and so on."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "But this is a really important point to me."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "I always thought that data augmentation holds an important key to big improvements in machine learning."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "And it seems that it is an important aspect of self supervised learning."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So I wonder if there's big improvements to be achieved on much more intelligent kinds of data augmentation."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "For example, currently, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, data augmentation is not parameterized."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "You're not learning."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "To me, it seems like data augmentation potentially should involve more learning than the learning process itself."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "You're almost like thinking of like generative kind of, it's the elves with bananas."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "You're trying to, it's like very active imagination of messing with the world and teaching that mechanism for messing with the world to be realistic."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "Because that feels like, I mean, it's imagination."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "It's just, as you said, it feels like us humans are able to, maybe sometimes subconsciously, imagine before we see the thing, imagine what we're expecting to see, like maybe several options."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And especially, we probably forgot, but when we were younger, probably the possibilities were wilder, more numerous."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And then as we get older, we become to understand the world and the possibilities of what we might see becomes less and less and less."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "So I wonder if you think there's a lot of breakthroughs yet to be had in data augmentation."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "And maybe also can you just comment on the stuff we have, is that a big part of self supervised learning?"}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So data augmentation is like key to self supervised learning that has like the kind of augmentation that we're using."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And basically the fact that we're trying to learn these neural networks that are predicting these features from images that are robust under data augmentation has been the key for visual self supervised learning."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "And they play a fairly fundamental role to it."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "Now, the irony of all of this is that for like deep learning purists will say the entire point of deep learning is that you feed in the pixels to the neural network and it should figure out the patterns on its own."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "So if it really wants to look at edges, it should look at edges."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "You shouldn't really like really go and handcraft these like features, right?"}, {"time": 3398, "text": "You shouldn't go tell it that look at edges."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "So data augmentation should basically be in the same category, right?"}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Why should we tell the network or tell this entire learning paradigm what kinds of data augmentation that we're looking for?"}, {"time": 3410, "text": "We are encoding a very sort of human specific bias there that we know things are like, if you change the contrast of the image, it should still be an apple or it should still see apple, not banana."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "And basically if we change like colors, it should still be the same kind of concept."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Of course, this is not one, this is doesn't feel like super satisfactory because a lot of our human knowledge or our human supervision is actually going into the data augmentation."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "So although we are calling it self supervised learning, a lot of the human knowledge is actually being encoded in the data augmentation process."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "So it's really like, we've kind of sneaked away the supervision at the input and we're like really designing these nice list of data augmentations that are working very well."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "Of course, the idea is that it's much easier to design a list of data augmentation than it is to do."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So humans are doing nevertheless doing less and less work and maybe leveraging their creativity more and more."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "And when we say data augmentation is not parameterized, it means it's not part of the learning process."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "Do you think it's possible to integrate some of the data augmentation into the learning process?"}, {"time": 3474, "text": "And in fact, it will be really beneficial for us because a lot of these data augmentations that we use in vision are very extreme."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "For example, like when you have certain concepts, again, a banana, you take the banana and then basically you change the color of the banana, right?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "So you make it a purple banana."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "Now this data augmentation process is actually independent of the, like it has no notion of what is present in the image."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "So it can change this color arbitrarily."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "It can make it a red banana as well."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And now what we're doing is we're telling the neural network that this red banana and so a crop of this image which has the red banana and a crop of this image where I changed the color to a purple banana should be, the features should be the same."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "Now bananas aren't red or purple mostly."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So really the data augmentation process should take into account what is present in the image and what are the kinds of physical realities that are possible."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "It shouldn't be completely independent of the image."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "So you might get big gains if you, instead of being drastic, do subtle augmentation but realistic augmentation."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "Right, realistic."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "I'm not sure if it's subtle, but like realistic for sure."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "If it's realistic, then even subtle augmentation will give you big benefits."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "And it will be like for particular domains you might actually see like, if for example, now we're doing medical imaging, there are going to be certain kinds of like geometric augmentation which are not really going to be very valid for the human body."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "So if you were to like actually loop in data augmentation into the learning process, it will actually be much more useful."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "Now this actually does take us to maybe a semi supervised kind of a setting because you do want to understand what is it that you're trying to solve."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So currently self supervised learning kind of operates in the wild, right?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "So you do the self supervised learning and the purists and all of us basically say that, okay, this should learn useful representations and they should be useful for any kind of end task, no matter it's like banana recognition or like autonomous driving."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "Now it's a tall order."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "Maybe the first baby step for us should be that, okay, if you're trying to loop in this data augmentation into the learning process, then we at least need to have some sense of what we're trying to do."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "Are we trying to distinguish between different types of bananas or are we trying to distinguish between banana and apple or are we trying to do all of these things at once?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And so some notion of like what happens at the end might actually help us do much better at this side."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "If I were to give you like a black box, like a choice to have an arbitrary large data set of real natural data versus really good data augmentation algorithms, which would you like to train in a self supervised way on?"}, {"time": 3631, "text": "So natural data from the internet are arbitrary large, so unlimited data, or it's like more controlled good data augmentation on the finite data set."}, {"time": 3643, "text": "The thing is like, because our learning algorithms for vision right now really rely on data augmentation, even if you were to give me like an infinite source of like image data, I still need a good data augmentation algorithm."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "You need something that tells you that two things are similar."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "And so something, because you've given me an arbitrary large data set, I still need to use data augmentation to take that image construct, like these two perturbations of it, and then learn from it."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "So the thing is our learning paradigm is very primitive right now."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Even if you were to give me lots of images, it's still not really useful."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "A good data augmentation algorithm is actually going to be more useful."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "So you can like reduce down the amount of data that you give me by like 10 times, but if you were to give me a good data augmentation algorithm, that would probably do better than giving me like 10 times the size of that data, but me having to rely on like a very primitive data augmentation algorithm."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "Like through tagging and all those kinds of things, is there a way to discover things that are semantically similar on the internet?"}, {"time": 3699, "text": "Obviously there is, but they might be extremely noisy."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And the difference might be farther away than you would be comfortable with."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "So, I mean, yes, tagging will help you a lot."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "It'll actually go a very long way in figuring out what images are related or not."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "And then, so, but then the purists would argue that when you're using human tags, because these tags are like supervision, is it really self supervised learning now?"}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Because you're using human tags to figure out which images are like similar."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "Hashtag no filter means a lot of things."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "I mean, there are certain tags which are going to be applicable pretty much to anything."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "So they're pretty useless for learning."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "But I mean, certain tags are actually like the Eiffel Tower, for example, or the Taj Mahal, for example."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "These tags are like very indicative of what's going on."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And they are, I mean, they are human supervision."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "This is one of the tasks of discovering from human generated data strong signals that could be leveraged for self supervision."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "Like humans are doing so much work already."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "Like many years ago, there was something that was called, I guess, human computation back in the day."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Humans are doing so much work."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "It'd be exciting to discover ways to leverage the work they're doing to teach machines without any extra effort from them."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "An example could be, like we said, driving, humans driving and machines can learn from the driving."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "I always hope that there could be some supervision signal discovered in video games, because there's so many people that play video games that it feels like so much effort is put into video games, into playing video games, and you can design video games somewhat cheaply to include whatever signals you want."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "It feels like that could be leverage somehow."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "So people are using that."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "Like there are actually folks right here in UT Austin, like Philip Granbull is a professor at UT Austin."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "He's been like working on video games as a source of supervision."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "I mean, it's really fun."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Like as a PhD student, getting to basically play video games all day."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "Yeah, but so I do hope that kind of thing scales and like ultimately boils down to discovering some undeniably very good signal."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "It's like masking in NLP."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "But that said, there's non contrastive methods."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "What do non contrastive energy based self supervised learning methods look like?"}, {"time": 3843, "text": "And why are they promising?"}, {"time": 3845, "text": "So like I said about contrastive learning, you have this notion of a positive and a negative."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "Now, the thing is, this entire learning paradigm really requires access to a lot of negatives to learn a good sort of feature space."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "The idea is if I tell you, okay, so a cat and a dog are similar, and they're very different from a banana."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "The thing is, this is a fairly simple analogy, right?"}, {"time": 3868, "text": "Because bananas look visually very different from what cats and dogs do."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "So very quickly, if this is the only source of supervision that I'm giving you, your learning is not going to be like, after a point, the neural network is really not going to learn a lot."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "Because the negative that you're getting is going to be so random."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So it can be, oh, a cat and a dog are very similar, but they're very different from a Volkswagen Beetle."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "Now, like this car looks very different from these animals again."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "So the thing is in contrastive learning, the quality of the negative sample really matters a lot."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "And so what has happened is basically that typically these methods that are contrastive really require access to lots of negatives, which becomes harder and harder to sort of scale when designing a learning algorithm."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "So that's been one of the reasons why non contrastive methods have become like popular and why people think that they're going to be more useful."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So a non contrastive method, for example, like clustering is one non contrastive method."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "The idea basically being that you have two of these samples, so the cat and dog or two crops of this image, they belong to the same cluster."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And so essentially you're basically doing clustering online when you're learning this network, and which is very different from having access to a lot of negatives explicitly."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "The other way which has become really popular is something called self distillation."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "So the idea basically is that you have a teacher network and a student network, and the teacher network produces a feature."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "So it takes in the image and basically the neural network figures out the patterns gets the feature out."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "And there's another neural network which is the student neural network and that also produces a feature."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "And now all you're doing is basically saying that the features produced by the teacher network and the student network should be very similar."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "There is no notion of a negative anymore."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So it's all about similarity maximization between these two features."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "And so all I need to now do is figure out how to have these two sorts of parallel networks, a student network and a teacher network."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And basically researchers have figured out very cheap methods to do this."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "So you can actually have for free really two types of neural networks."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "They're kind of related, but they're different enough that you can actually basically have a learning problem set up."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "So you can ensure that they always remain different enough."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So the thing doesn't collapse into something boring."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "So the main sort of enemy of self supervised learning, any kind of similarity maximization technique is collapse."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "It's a collapse means that you learn the same feature representation for all the images in the world, which is completely useless."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "Everything's a banana."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "Everything is a banana."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "Everything is a cat."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "Everything is a car."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "And so all we need to do is basically come up with ways to prevent collapse."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "Contrastive learning is one way of doing it."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "And then for example, like clustering or self distillation or other ways of doing it."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "We also had a recent paper where we used like de correlation between like two sets of features to prevent collapse."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "So that's inspired a little bit by like Horace Barlow's neuroscience principles."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "By the way, I should comment that whoever counts the number of times the word banana, apple, cat and dog were using this conversation wins the internet."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "I wish you luck."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "What is Suave and the main improvement proposed in the paper on supervised learning of visual features by contrasting cluster assignments?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "Suave basically is a clustering based technique, which is for again, the same thing for self supervised learning in vision where we have two crops."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "And the idea basically is that you want the features from these two crops of an image to lie in the same cluster and basically crops that are coming from different images to be in different clusters."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "Now, typically in a sort of, if you were to do this clustering, you would perform clustering offline."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "What that means is you would, if you have a dataset of N examples, you would run over all of these N examples, get features for them, perform clustering."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "So basically get some clusters and then repeat the process again."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "So this is offline basically because I need to do one pass through the data to compute its clusters."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "Suave is basically just a simple way of doing this online."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "So as you're going through the data, you're actually computing these clusters online."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And so of course there is like a lot of tricks involved in how to do this in a robust manner without collapsing, but this is this sort of key idea to it."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Is there a nice way to say what is the key methodology of the clustering that enables that?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "Right, so the idea basically is that when you have N samples, we assume that we have access to, like there are always K clusters in a dataset."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "K is a fixed number."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "So for example, K is 3000."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "And so if you have any, when you look at any sort of small number of examples, all of them must belong to one of these K clusters."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And we impose this equipartition constraint."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "What this means is that basically your entire set of N samples should be equally partitioned into K clusters."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "So all your K clusters are basically equal, they have equal contribution to these N samples."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And this ensures that we never collapse."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "So collapse can be viewed as a way in which all samples belong to one cluster, right?"}, {"time": 4170, "text": "So all this, if all features become the same, then you have basically just one mega cluster."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "You don't even have like 10 clusters or 3000 clusters."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "So Suave basically ensures that at each point, all these 3000 clusters are being used in the clustering process."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "Basically just figure out how to do this online."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "And again, basically just make sure that two crops from the same image belong to the same cluster and others don't."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And the fact they have a fixed K makes things simpler."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "Fixed K makes things simpler."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "Our clustering is not like really hard clustering, it's soft clustering."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "So basically you can be 0.2 to cluster number one and 0.8 to cluster number two."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "So it's not really hard."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "So essentially, even though we have like 3000 clusters, we can actually represent a lot of clusters."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "What is SEER, S E E R?"}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And what are the key results and insights in the paper, Self Supervised Pre Training of Visual Features in the Wild?"}, {"time": 4227, "text": "What is this big, beautiful SEER system?"}, {"time": 4230, "text": "SEER, so I'll first go to Suave because Suave is actually like one of the key components for SEER."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "So Suave was, when we use Suave, it was demonstrated on ImageNet."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "So typically like self supervised methods, the way we sort of operate is like in the research community, we kind of cheat."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "So we take ImageNet, which of course I talked about as having lots of labels."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "And then we throw away the labels, like throw away all the hard work that went behind basically the labeling process."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "And we pretend that it is unsupervised."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "But the problem here is that we have, like when we collected these images, the ImageNet dataset has a particular distribution of concepts, right?"}, {"time": 4269, "text": "So these images are very curated."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "And what that means is these images, of course, belong to a certain set of noun concepts."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "And also ImageNet has this bias that all images contain an object, which is like very big and it's typically in the center."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "So when you're talking about a dog, it's a well framed dog, it's towards the center of the image."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "So a lot of the data augmentation, a lot of the sort of hidden assumptions in self supervised learning, actually really exploit this bias of ImageNet."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And so, I mean, a lot of my work, a lot of work from other people always uses ImageNet sort of as the benchmark to show the success of self supervised learning."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "So you're implying that there's particular limitations to this kind of dataset?"}, {"time": 4309, "text": "Yes, I mean, it's basically because our data augmentation that we designed, like all data augmentation that we designed for self supervised learning in vision are kind of overfit to ImageNet."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "But you're saying a little bit hard coded like the cropping."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "Exactly, the cropping parameters, the kind of lighting that we're using, the kind of blurring that we're using."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "Yeah, but you would, for more in the wild dataset, you would need to be clever or more careful in setting the range of parameters and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So for SEER, our main goal was twofold."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "One, basically to move away from ImageNet for training."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "So the images that we used were like uncurated images."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Now there's a lot of debate whether they're actually curated or not, but I'll talk about that later."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "But the idea was basically, these are going to be random internet images that we're not going to filter out based on like particular categories."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So we did not say that, oh, images that belong to dogs and cats should be the only images that come in this dataset, banana."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "And basically, other images should be thrown out."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "So we didn't do any of that."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "So these are random internet images."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And of course, it also goes back to like the problem of scale that you talked about."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "So these were basically about a billion or so images."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And for context ImageNet, the ImageNet version that we use was 1 million images earlier."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "So this is basically going like three orders of magnitude more."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "The idea was basically to see if we can train a very large convolutional model in a self supervised way on this uncurated, but really large set of images."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "And how well would this model do?"}, {"time": 4398, "text": "So is self supervised learning really overfit to ImageNet or can it actually work in the wild?"}, {"time": 4403, "text": "And it was also out of curiosity, what kind of things will this model learn?"}, {"time": 4407, "text": "Will it actually be able to still figure out different types of objects and so on?"}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Would there be particular kinds of tasks that would actually do better than an ImageNet train model?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And so for Sear, one of our main findings was that we can actually train very large models in a completely self supervised way on lots of internet images without really necessarily filtering them out."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "Which was in itself a good thing because it's a fairly simple process, right?"}, {"time": 4431, "text": "So you get images which are uploaded and you basically can immediately use them to train a model in an unsupervised way."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "You don't really need to sit and filter them out."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "These images can be cartoons, these can be memes, these can be actual pictures uploaded by people."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And you don't really care about what these images are."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "You don't even care about what concepts they contain."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So this was a very sort of simple setup."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "What image selection mechanism would you say is there like inherent in some aspect of the process?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "So you're kind of implying that there's almost none, but what is there would you say if you were to introspect?"}, {"time": 4464, "text": "Right, so it's not like uncurated can basically like one way of imagining uncurated is basically you have like cameras that can take pictures at random viewpoints."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "When people upload pictures to the internet, they are typically going to care about the framing of it."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "They're not going to upload, say, the picture of a zoomed in wall, for example."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "Well, when you say internet, do you mean social networks?"}, {"time": 4487, "text": "So these are not going to be like pictures of like a zoomed in table or a zoomed in wall."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "So it's not really completely uncurated because people do have the like photographer's bias where they do want to keep things towards the center a little bit, or like really have like nice looking things and so on in the picture."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "So that's the kind of bias that typically exists in this data set and also the user base, right?"}, {"time": 4507, "text": "You're not going to get lots of pictures from different parts of the world because there are certain parts of the world where people may not actually be uploading a lot of pictures to the internet or may not even have access to a lot of internet."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "So this is a giant data set and a giant neural network."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "I don't think we've talked about what architectures work well for SSL, for self supervised learning."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "For SEER and for SWAB, we were using convolutional networks, but recently in a work called Dyno, we've basically started using transformers for vision."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Both seem to work really well, Connets and transformers."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "And depending on what you want to do, you might choose to use a particular formulation."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "So for SEER, it was a Connet."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "It was particularly a RegNet model, which was also a work from Facebook."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "RegNets are like really good when it comes to compute versus like accuracy."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So because it was a very efficient model, compute and memory wise efficient, and basically it worked really well in terms of scaling."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So we used a very large RegNet model and trained it on a billion images."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "Can you maybe quickly comment on what RegNets are?"}, {"time": 4569, "text": "It comes from this paper, Designing Network Design Spaces."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "This is a super interesting concept that emphasizes how to create efficient neural networks, large neural networks."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "So one of the sort of key takeaways from this paper, which the authors, like whenever you hear them present this work, they keep saying is, a lot of neural networks are characterized in terms of flops, right?"}, {"time": 4589, "text": "Flops basically being the floating point operations."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And people really love to use flops to say, this model is like really computationally heavy, or like our model is computationally cheap and so on."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "Now it turns out that flops are really not a good indicator of how well a particular network is, like how efficient it is really."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "And what a better indicator is, is the activation or the memory that is being used by this particular model."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "And so designing, like one of the key findings from this paper was basically that you need to design network families or neural network architectures that are actually very efficient in the memory space as well, not just in terms of pure flops."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "So RegNet is basically a network architecture family that came out of this paper that is particularly good at both flops and the sort of memory required for it."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "And of course it builds upon like earlier work, like ResNet being like the sort of more popular inspiration for it, where you have residual connections."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "But one of the things in this work is basically they also use like squeeze excitation blocks."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "So it's a lot of nice sort of technical innovation in all of this from prior work, and a lot of the ingenuity of these particular authors in how to combine these multiple building blocks."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "But the key constraint was optimize for both flops and memory when you're basically doing this, don't just look at flops."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "And that allows you to what have a, sort of have very large networks through this process, can optimize for low, like for efficiency, for low memory."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "Also in just in terms of pure hardware, they fit very well on GPU memory."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "So they can be like really powerful neural network architectures with lots of parameters, lots of flops, but also because they're like efficient in terms of the amount of memory that they're using, you can actually fit a lot of these on like a, you can fit a very large model on a single GPU for example."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "Would you say that the choice of architecture matters more than the choice of maybe data augmentation techniques?"}, {"time": 4698, "text": "Is there a possibility to say what matters more?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "You kind of imply that you can probably go really far with just using basic conv nuts."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "All right, I think like data and data augmentation, the algorithm being used for the self supervised training matters a lot more than the particular kind of architecture."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "With different types of architecture, you will get different like properties in the resulting sort of representation."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "But really, I mean, the secret sauce is in the augmentation and the algorithm being used to train them."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "The architectures, I mean, at this point, a lot of them perform very similarly, depending on like the particular task that you care about, they have certain advantages and disadvantages."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said about what it takes with Sears to train a giant neural network?"}, {"time": 4741, "text": "You're talking about a huge amount of data, a huge neural network."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said of how to effectively train something like that fast?"}, {"time": 4751, "text": "Lots of GPUs."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "I mean, so the model was like a billion parameters."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "And it was trained on a billion images."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So if like, basically the same number of parameters as the number of images, and it took a while."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "I don't remember the exact number, it's in the paper, but it took a while."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "I guess I'm trying to get at is, when you're thinking of scaling this kind of thing, I mean, one of the exciting possibilities of self supervised learning is the several orders of magnitude scaling of everything, both the neural network and the size of the data."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "And so the question is, do you think there's some interesting tricks to do large scale distributed compute, or is that really outside of even deep learning?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "That's more about like hardware engineering."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "I think more and more there is like this, a lot of like systems are designed, basically taking into account the machine learning needs, right?"}, {"time": 4812, "text": "So because whenever you're doing this kind of distributed training, there is a lot of intercommunication between nodes."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "So like gradients or the model parameters are being passed."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "So you really want to minimize communication costs when you really want to scale these models up."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "You want basically to be able to do as much, like as limited amount of communication as possible."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "So currently like a dominant paradigm is synchronized sort of training."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "So essentially after every sort of gradient step, all you basically have like a synchronization step between all the sort of compute chips that you're going on with."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "I think asynchronous training was popular, but it doesn't seem to perform as well."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "But in general, I think that's sort of the, I guess it's outside my scope as well."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "But the main thing is like minimize the amount of synchronization steps that you have."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "That has been the key takeaway, at least in my experience."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "The others I have no idea about, how to design the chip."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "Yeah, there's very few things that I see Jim Keller's eyes light up as much as talking about giant computers doing like that fast communication that you're talking to well when they're training machine learning systems."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "What is VSSL, V I S S L, the PyTorch based SSL library?"}, {"time": 4887, "text": "What are the use cases that you might have?"}, {"time": 4890, "text": "VSSL basically was born out of a lot of us at Facebook are doing the self supervised learning research."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "So it's a common framework in which we have like a lot of self supervised learning methods implemented for vision."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "It's also, it has in itself like a benchmark of tasks that you can evaluate the self supervised representations on."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "So the use case for it is basically for anyone who's either trying to evaluate their self supervised model or train their self supervised model, or a researcher who's trying to build a new self supervised technique."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So it's basically supposed to be all of these things."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "So as a researcher before VSSL, for example, or like when we started doing this work fairly seriously at Facebook, it was very hard for us to go and implement every self supervised learning model, test it out in a like sort of consistent manner."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "The experimental setup was very different across different groups."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "Even when someone said that they were reporting image net accuracy, it could mean lots of different things."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "So with VSSL, we tried to really sort of standardize that as much as possible."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And there was a paper like we did in 2019 just about benchmarking."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And so VSSL basically builds upon a lot of this kind of work that we did about like benchmarking."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "And then every time we try to like, we come up with a self supervised learning method, a lot of us try to push that into VSSL as well, just so that it basically is like the central piece where a lot of these methods can reside."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "Just out of curiosity, people may be, so certainly outside of Facebook, but just researchers, or just even people that know how to program in Python and know how to use PyTorch, what would be the use case?"}, {"time": 4978, "text": "What would be a fun thing to play around with VSSL on?"}, {"time": 4981, "text": "Like what's a fun thing to play around with self supervised learning on, would you say?"}, {"time": 4987, "text": "Is there a good Hello World program?"}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Like is it always about big size that's important to have, or is there fun little smaller case playgrounds to play around with?"}, {"time": 4999, "text": "So we're trying to like push something towards that."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "I think there are a few setups out there, but nothing like super standard on the smaller scale."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "I mean, ImageNet in itself is actually pretty big also."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "So that is not something which is like feasible for a lot of people."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "But we are trying to like push up with like smaller sort of use cases."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "The thing is, at a smaller scale, a lot of the observations or a lot of the algorithms that work don't necessarily translate into the medium or the larger scale."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "So it's really tricky to come up with a good small scale setup where a lot of your empirical observations will really translate to the other setup."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "So it's been really challenging."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "I've been trying to do that for a little bit as well because it does take time to train stuff on ImageNet."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "It does take time to train on like more images, but pretty much every time I've tried to do that, it's been unsuccessful because all the observations I draw from my set of experiments on a smaller data set don't translate into ImageNet or like don't translate into another sort of data set."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "So it's been hard for us to figure this one out, but it's an important problem."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "So there's this really interesting idea of learning across multiple modalities."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "You have a CVPR 2021 best paper candidate titled audio visual instance discrimination with cross modal agreement."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "What are the key results, insights in this paper and what can you say in general about the promise and power of multimodal learning?"}, {"time": 5077, "text": "For this paper, it actually came as a little bit of a shock to me at how well it worked."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "So I can describe what the problem set up was."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "So it's been used in the past by lots of folks like for example, Andrew Owens from MIT, Alyosha Efros from Berkeley, Andrew Zisserman from Oxford."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So a lot of these people have been sort of showing results in this."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "Of course, I was aware of this result, but I wasn't really sure how well it would work in practice for like other sort of downstream tasks."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "So the results kept getting better."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "And I wasn't sure if like a lot of our insights from self supervised learning would translate into this multimodal learning problem."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "So multimodal learning is when you have like, when you have multiple modalities."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "That's not even cool."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "Okay, so the particular modalities that we worked on in this work were audio and video."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "So the idea was basically, if you have a video, you have its corresponding audio track."}, {"time": 5125, "text": "And you want to use both of these signals, the audio signal and the video signal to learn a good representation for video and good representation for audio."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "Like this podcast."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "Like this podcast, exactly."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So what we did in this work was basically train two different neural networks, one on the video signal, one on the audio signal."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "And what we wanted is basically the features that we get from both of these neural networks should be similar."}, {"time": 5146, "text": "So it should basically be able to produce the same kinds of features from the video and the same kinds of features from the audio."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "Now, why is this useful?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "Well, for a lot of these objects that we have, there is a characteristic sound, right?"}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So trains, when they go by, they make a particular kind of sound."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "Boats make a particular kind of sound."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "People, when they're jumping around, will like shout, whatever."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "Bananas don't make a sound."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "So where you can't learn anything about bananas there."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "Or when humans mentioned bananas."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "Well, yes, when they say the word banana, then."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "So you can't trust basically anything that comes out of a human's mouth as a source, that source of audio is useless."}, {"time": 5179, "text": "The typical use case is basically like, for example, someone playing a musical instrument."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "So guitars have a particular kind of sound and so on."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "So because a lot of these things are correlated, the idea in multimodal learning is to take these two kinds of modalities, video and audio, and learn a common embedding space, a common feature space where both of these related modalities can basically be close together."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "And again, you use contrastive learning for this."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "So in contrastive learning, basically the video and the corresponding audio are positives."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "And you can take any other video or any other audio and that becomes a negative."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "And so basically that's it."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "It's just a simple application of contrastive learning."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "The main sort of finding from this work for us was basically that you can actually learn very, very powerful feature representations, very, very powerful video representations."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "So you can learn the sort of video network that we ended up learning can actually be used for downstream, for example, recognizing human actions or recognizing different types of sounds, for example."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "So this was sort of the key finding."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "Can you give kind of an example of a human action or like just so we can build up intuition of what kind of thing?"}, {"time": 5244, "text": "Right, so there is this data set called kinetics, for example, which has like 400 different types of human actions."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "So people jumping, people doing different kinds of sports or different types of swimming."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "So like different strokes and swimming, golf and so on."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "So there are like just different types of actions right there."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "And the point is this kind of video network that you learn in a self supervised way can be used very easily to kind of recognize these different types of actions."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "It can also be used for recognizing different types of objects."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "And what we did is we tried to visualize whether the network can figure out where the sound is coming from."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "So basically, give it a video and basically play say of a person just strumming a guitar, but of course, there is no audio in this."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "And now you give it this sound of a guitar."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "And you ask like basically try to visualize where the network thinks the sound is coming from."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "And that can kind of basically draw like when you visualize it, you can see that it's basically focusing on the guitar."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "Yeah, that's surreal."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And the same thing, for example, for certain people's voices, like famous celebrities voices, it can actually figure out where their mouth is."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "So it can actually distinguish different people's voices, for example, a little bit as well."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "Without that ever being annotated in any way."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "Right, so this is all what it had discovered."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "We never pointed out that this is a guitar and this is the kind of sound it produces."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "It can actually naturally figure that out because it's seen so many correlations of this sound coming with this kind of like an object that it basically learns to associate this sound with this kind of an object."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "Yeah, that's really fascinating, right?"}, {"time": 5333, "text": "So the idea with this kind of network is then you then fine tune it for a particular task."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "So this is forming like a really good knowledge base within a neural network based on which you could then the train a little bit more to accomplish a specific task."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "Well, so you don't need a lot of videos of humans doing actions annotated."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "You can just use a few of them to basically get your."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "How much insight do you draw from the fact that it can figure out where the sound is coming from?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "I'm trying to see, so that's kind of very, it's very CVPR beautiful, right?"}, {"time": 5368, "text": "It's a cool little insight."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "I wonder how profound that is."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "Does it speak to the idea that multiple modalities are somehow much bigger than the sum of their parts?"}, {"time": 5384, "text": "Or is it really, really useful to have multiple modalities?"}, {"time": 5388, "text": "Or is it just that cool thing that there's parts of our world that can be revealed like effectively through multiple modalities, but most of it is really all about vision or about one of the modalities."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "I would say a little tending more towards the second part."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "So most of it can be sort of figured out with one modality, but having an extra modality always helps you."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "So in this case, for example, like one thing is when you're, if you observe someone cutting something and you don't have any sort of sound there, whether it's an apple or whether it's an onion, it's very hard to figure that out."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "But if you hear someone cutting it, it's very easy to figure it out because apples and onions make a very different kind of characteristics on when they're cut."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "So you really figure this out based on audio, it's much easier."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "So your life will become much easier when you have access to different kinds of modalities."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And the other thing is, so I like to relate it in this way, it may be like completely wrong, but the distributional hypothesis in NLP, where context basically gives kind of meaning to that word, sound kind of does that too."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "So if you have the same sound, so that's the same context across different videos, you're very likely to be observing the same kind of concept."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "So that's the kind of reason why it figures out the guitar thing, right?"}, {"time": 5466, "text": "It observed the same sound across multiple different videos and it figures out maybe this is the common factor that's actually doing it."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "I wonder, I used to have this argument with my dad a bunch for creating general intelligence, whether smell is an important, like if that's important sensory information, mostly we're talking about like falling in love with an AI system and for him, smell and touch are important."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "And I was arguing that it's not at all."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "It's important, it's nice and everything, but like you can fall in love with just language really, but a voice is very powerful and vision is next and smell is not that important."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "Can I ask you about this process of active learning?"}, {"time": 5506, "text": "You mentioned interactivity."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "Is there some value within the self supervised learning context to select parts of the data in intelligent ways such that they would most benefit the learning process?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "So I think so."},

about active learning."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "I think Yannakun told me that active learning is not that interesting."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "I think back then I didn't want to argue with him too much, but when we talk again, we're gonna spend three hours arguing about active learning."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "My sense was you can go extremely far with active learning, perhaps farther than anything else."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "Like to me, there's this kind of intuition that similar to data augmentation, you can get a lot from the data, from intelligent optimized usage of the data."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "I'm trying to speak generally in such a way that includes data augmentation and active learning, that there's something about maybe interactive exploration of the data that at least is part of the solution to intelligence, like an important part."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "I don't know what your thoughts are on active learning in general."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "I actually really like active learning."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "So back in the day we did this largely ignored CVPR paper called learning by asking questions."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "So the idea was basically you would train an agent that would ask a question about the image."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "It would get an answer and basically then it would update itself."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "It would see the next image."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "It would decide what's the next hardest question that I can ask to learn the most."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "And the idea was basically because it was being smart about the kinds of questions it was asking, it would learn in fewer samples."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "It would be more efficient at using data."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "And we did find to some extent that it was actually better than randomly asking questions."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "Kind of weird thing about active learning is it's also a chicken and egg problem because when you look at an image, to ask a good question about the image, you need to understand something about the image."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "You can't ask a completely arbitrarily random question."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "It may not even apply to that particular image."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "So there is some amount of understanding or knowledge that basically keeps getting built when you're doing active learning."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "So I think active learning by itself is really good."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "And the main thing we need to figure out is basically how do we come up with a technique to first model what the model knows and also model what the model does not know."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "I think that's the sort of beauty of it."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "Because when you know that there are certain things that you don't know anything about, asking a question about those concepts is actually going to bring you the most value."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "And I think that's the sort of key challenge."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Now, self supervised learning by itself, like selecting data for it and so on, that's actually really useful."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "But I think that's a very narrow view of looking at active learning."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "If you look at it more broadly, it is basically about if the model has a knowledge about N concepts, and it is weak basically about certain things."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "So it needs to ask questions either to discover new concepts or to basically increase its knowledge about these N concepts."}, {"time": 5690, "text": "So at that level, it's a very powerful technique."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "I actually do think it's going to be really useful."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Even in like simple things such as like data labeling, it's super useful."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "So here is like one simple way that you can use active learning."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "For example, you have your self supervised model, which is very good at predicting similarities and dissimilarities between things."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "And so if you label a picture as basically say a banana, now you know that all the images that are very similar to this image are also likely to contain bananas."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "So probably when you want to understand what else is a banana, you're not going to use these other images."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "You're actually going to use an image that is not completely dissimilar, but somewhere in between, which is not super similar to this image, but not super dissimilar either."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "And that's going to tell you a lot more about what this concept of a banana is."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "So that's kind of a heuristic."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "I wonder if it's possible to also learn ways to discover the most likely, the most beneficial image."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "So like, so not just looking a thing that's somewhat similar to a banana, but not exactly similar, but have some kind of more complicated learning system, like learned discovering mechanism that tells you what image to look for."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "Like how, yeah, like actually in a self supervised way, learning strictly a function that says, is this image going to be very useful to me given what I currently know?"}, {"time": 5782, "text": "I think there's a lot of synergy there."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "It's just, I think, yeah, it's going to be explored."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "I think very much related to that."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "I kind of think of what Tesla Autopilot is doing currently as kind of active learning."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "There's something that Andre Capati and their team are calling a data engine."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "So you're basically deploying a bunch of instantiations of a neural network into the wild, and they're collecting a bunch of edge cases that are then sent back for annotation for particular, and edge cases as defined as near failure or some weirdness on a particular task that's then sent back."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "It's that not exactly a banana, but almost the banana cases sent back for annotation."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "And then there's this loop that keeps going and you keep retraining and retraining."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "And the active learning step there, or whatever you want to call it, is the cars themselves that are sending you back the data."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "Like, what the hell happened here?"}, {"time": 5840, "text": "This was weird."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "What are your thoughts about that sort of deployment of neural networks in the wild?"}, {"time": 5848, "text": "Another way to ask a question from first is your thoughts."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "And maybe if you want to comment, is there applications for autonomous driving, like computer vision based autonomous driving, applications of self supervised learning in the context of computer vision based autonomous driving?"}, {"time": 5868, "text": "I think for self supervised learning to be used in autonomous driving, there are lots of opportunities."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "I mean, just like pure consistency in predictions is one way, right?"}, {"time": 5875, "text": "So because you have this nice sequence of data that is coming in, a video stream of it, associated of course with the actions that say the car took, you can form a very nice predictive model of what's happening."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "So for example, like all the way, like one way possibly in which how they're figuring out what data to get labeled is basically through prediction uncertainty, right?"}, {"time": 5897, "text": "So you predict that the car was going to turn right."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "So this was the action that was going to happen, say in the shadow mode."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "And now the driver turned left."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "And this is a really big surprise."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "So basically by forming these good predictive models, you are, I mean, these are kind of self supervised models."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "Prediction models are basically being trained just by looking at what's going to happen next and asking them to predict what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 5918, "text": "So I would say this is really like one use of self supervised learning."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "It's a predictive model and you're learning a predictive model basically just by looking at what data you have."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "Is there something about that active learning context that you find insights from?"}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Like that kind of deployment of the system, seeing cases where it doesn't perform as you expected and then retraining the system based on that?"}, {"time": 5941, "text": "I think that, I mean, that really resonates with me."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "It's super smart to do it that way."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "Because I mean, the thing is with any kind of like practical system, like autonomous driving, there are those edge cases that are the things that are actually the problem, right?"}, {"time": 5954, "text": "I mean, highway driving or like freeway driving has basically been like, there has been a lot of success in that particular part of autonomous driving for a long time."}, {"time": 5962, "text": "I would say like since the eighties or something."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "Now the point is all these failure cases are the sort of reason why autonomous driving hasn't become like super, super mainstream and available like in every possible car right now."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "And so basically by really scaling this problem out by really trying to get all of these edge cases out as quickly as possible, and then just like using those to improve your model, that's super smart."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "And prediction uncertainty to do that is like one really nice way of doing it."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Let me put you on the spot."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "So we mentioned offline Jitendra, he thinks that the Tesla computer vision approach or really any approach for autonomous driving is very far away."},

this is highway and city driving, but not everywhere, but mostly everywhere."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "And it's, let's say significantly better, like say five times less accidents than humans."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "Sufficiently safer such that the public feels like that transition is enticing beneficial both for our safety and financial and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "Okay, so first disclaimer, I'm not an expert in autonomous driving."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "So let me put it out there."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "I would say like at least five to 10 years."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "This would be my guess from now."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "Yeah, I'm actually very impressed."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "Like when I sat in a friend's Tesla recently and of course, like looking on that screen, it basically shows all the detections and everything."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "The car is doing as you're driving by and that's super distracting for me as a person because all I keep looking at is like the bounding boxes in the cars it's tracking and it's really impressive."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "Like especially when it's raining and it's able to do that, that was the most impressive part for me."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "It's actually able to get through rain and do that."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "And one of the reasons why like a lot of us believed and I would put myself in that category is LIDAR based sort of technology for autonomous driving was the key driver, right?"}, {"time": 6108, "text": "So Waymo was using it for the longest time."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "And Tesla then decided to go this completely other route that we are not going to even use LIDAR."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "So their initial system I think was camera and radar based and now they're actually moving to a completely like vision based system."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "And so that was just like, it sounded completely crazy."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Like LIDAR is very useful in cases where you have low visibility."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "Of course it comes with its own set of complications."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "But now to see that happen in like on a live Tesla that basically just proves everyone wrong I would say in a way."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And that's just working really well."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "I think there were also like a lot of advancements in camera technology."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Now there were like, I know at CMU when I was there there was a particular kind of camera that had been developed that was really good at basically low visibility setting."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "So like lots of snow and lots of rain it could actually still have a very reasonable visibility."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "And I think there are lots of these kinds of innovations that will happen on the sensor side itself which is actually going to make this very easy in the future."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "And so maybe that's actually why I'm more optimistic about vision based self, like autonomous driving."}, {"time": 6169, "text": "I was going to call it self supervised driving, but."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "Vision based autonomous driving."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "That's the reason I'm quite optimistic about it because I think there are going to be lots of these advances on the sensor side itself."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "So acquiring this data we're actually going to get much better about it."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "And then of course, once we're able to scale out and get all of these edge cases in as like Andre described I think that's going to make us go very far away."}, {"time": 6191, "text": "Yeah, so it's funny."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "I'm very much with you on the five to 10 years maybe 10 years but you made it, I'm not sure how you made it sound but for some people that seem that might seem like really far away."}, {"time": 6205, "text": "And then for other people, it might seem like very close."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "There's a lot of fundamental questions about how much game theory is in this whole thing."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So like, how much is this simply a collision avoidance problem and how much of it is you still interacting with other humans in the scene and you're trying to create an experience that's compelling."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "So you want to get from point A to point B quickly you want to navigate the scene in a safe way but you also want to show some level of aggression because well, certainly this

or New York or basically any major city but I think it's probably Elon that I talked the most about this which is a surprise to the level of which they're not considering human beings as a huge problem in this, as a source of problem."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "Like the driving is fundamentally a robot on robot versus the environment problem versus like you can just consider humans not part of the problem."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "I used to think humans are almost certainly have to be modeled really well."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "Pedestrians and cyclists and humans inside other cars

supervised learning does, which is well maybe through the learning you'll get all the human like human information you need."}, {"time": 6304, "text": "Like maybe you'll get it just with enough data."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "You don't need to have explicit good models of human behavior."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Maybe you get it through the data."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "So, I mean my skepticism also just knowing a lot of automotive companies and how difficult it is to be innovative."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "I was skeptical that they would be able at scale to convert the driving scene across the world into digital form such that you can create this data engine at scale."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "And the fact that Tesla is at least getting there or are already there makes me think that it's now starting to be coupled to this self supervised learning vision which is like if that's gonna work if through purely this process you can get really far then maybe you can solve

a human robot interaction problem."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "It is not a robotics problem or computer vision problem."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Like you have to have a human in the loop."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "But so which is why I think it's 10 years plus."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "But I do think there'll be a bunch of cities and contexts where geo restricted it will work really, really damn well."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "So I think for me that gets five if I'm being optimistic and it's going to be five for a lot of cases and 10 plus, yeah, I agree with you."}, {"time": 6429,

there's something to me, like because humans are part of the picture, deeply part of the picture, and also human society is part of the picture in that human life is at stake."}, {"time": 6467,

that into the whole thing."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "Just like Facebook or social networks, one thing is to say how to make a really good recommender system."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "And then the

be."}, {"time": 6561, "text": "But like I said, I think anywhere you want to interact with human self supervised learning kind of hits a boundary very quickly because you need to have an interface to be able to communicate with the human."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "So really like if you have just like vacuous concepts or like just like nebulous concepts discovered by a network, it's very hard to communicate those with the human without like inserting some kind of human knowledge or some kind of like human bias there."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "In general, I think for deep learning, the biggest challenge is just like data efficiency."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "Even with self supervised learning, even with anything else, if you just see a single concept once, like one image of like, I don't know, whatever you want to call it, like any concept, it's really hard for these methods to generalize by looking at just one or two samples of things and that has been a real challenge."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "I think that's actually why like these edge cases, for example, for Tesla are actually that important."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "Because if you see just one instance of the car failing and if you just annotate that and you get that into your data set, you have like very limited guarantee that it's not going to happen again."}, {"time": 6625, "text": "And you're actually going to be able to recognize this kind of instance in a very different scenario."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "So like when it was snowing, so you got that thing labeled when it was snowing, but now when it's raining, you're actually not able to get it."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "Or you basically have the same scenario in a different part of the world."}, {"time": 6637, "text": "So the lighting was different or so on."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "So it's just really hard for these models, like deep learning especially to do that."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "How do we solve handwritten digit recognition problem when we only have one example for each number?"}, {"time": 6651, "text": "It feels like humans are using something like learning."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "I think we are good at transferring knowledge a little bit."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "We are just better at like for a lot of these problems where we are generalizing from a single sample or recognizing from a single sample, we are using a lot of our own domain knowledge and a lot of our like inductive bias into that one sample to generalize it."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "So I've never seen you write the number nine, for example."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "And if you were to write it, I would still get it."}, {"time": 6677, "text": "And if you were to write a different kind of alphabet and like write it in

no guarantees for it."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "Now you can argue that humans also don't have any guarantees."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "Like there is no guarantee that I can recognize a cat in every scenario."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "I'm sure there are going to be lots of cats that I don't recognize, lots of scenarios in which I don't recognize cats in general."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "But I think from just a sort of application perspective, you do need guarantees, right?"}, {"time": 6714, "text": "We call these things algorithms."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "Now algorithms, like

if you have this kind of failure case existing, then you think of it as like something is wrong."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "I think there is this sort of notion of nebulous correctness for machine learning."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "And that's something we just need to be very comfortable with."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "And for deep learning, or like for a lot of these machine learning

between the concept of learning and the concept of reasoning?"}, {"time": 6784, "text": "Do you think it's possible for neural networks to reason?"}, {"time": 6790, "text": "So I think of it slightly differently."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So for me, learning is whenever I can like make a snap judgment."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So if you show me a picture of a dog, I can immediately say it's a dog."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "But if you give me like a puzzle, like whatever a Goldsberg machine of like things going to happen, then I have to reason because I've never, it's a very complicated setup."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "I've never seen that particular setup."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "And I really need to draw and like imagine in my head what's going to happen to figure it out."},

part before."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "And now probably like this is how they're going to work in tandem."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "It's very hard for them to come up with these kinds of things."},

learned?"}, {"time": 6865, "text": "You know, this step of like building things on top of you, like little intuitions, concepts on top of each other, can that be learnable?"}, {"time": 6876, "text":

machines that have like, or individuals that have learned this, right?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Like humans have learned this."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "So it is, of course, it is a technique that is very easy to learn."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "I think where we are kind of hitting a wall basically with like current machine learning is the fact that when the network learns all of this

standard things."}, {"time": 6980, "text": "The thing basically being that if you teach a network like to recognize dogs, and now you teach that same network to recognize cats, it basically forgets how to recognize dogs."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "So it forgets very quickly."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "I mean, and whereas a human, if you were to teach someone to recognize dogs and then to recognize cats, they don't forget immediately how to recognize these dogs."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "I think that's basically sort of what you're trying to get."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "Yeah, I just, I wonder if like the long term memory mechanisms or the mechanisms that store not just memories, but concepts that allow you to the reason and compose concepts, if those things will look very different than neural networks, or if you can do that within a single neural network with some particular sort of architecture quirks, that seems to be a really open problem."}, {"time": 7027, "text":

have some more human elements like self awareness?"}, {"time": 7110, "text": "I think emotion."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "I think emotion is something which is like, it's not really attributed typically in standard machine learning."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "It's not something we think about, like there is NLP, there is vision, there is no like emotion."}, {"time": 7122, "text": "Emotion is never a part of all of this."}, {"time": 7124, "text": "And that just seems a little bit weird to me."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "I think the reason basically being that there is surprise and like, basically emotion is like one of the reasons emotions arise is like what happens and what do you expect to happen, right?"}, {"time": 7137, "text": "There is like a mismatch between these things."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "And so that gives rise to like, I can either be surprised or I can be saddened or I can be happy and all of this."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "And so this basically indicates that I already have a predictive model in my head and something that I predicted or something that I thought was likely to happen."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And then there was something that I observed that happened that there was a disconnect between these two things."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "And that basically is like maybe one of the reasons like you have a lot of emotions."}, {"time": 7164, "text": "Yeah, I think, so I talk to people a lot about them like Lisa Feldman Barrett."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "I think that's an interesting concept of emotion but I have a sense that emotion primarily in the way we think about it, which is the display of emotion is a communication mechanism between humans."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "So it's a part of basically human to human interaction, an important part, but just the part."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "So it's like, I would throw it into the full mix of communication."}, {"time": 7198, "text": "And to me, communication can be done with objects that don't look at all like humans."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "I've seen our ability to anthropomorphize our ability to connect with things that look like a Roomba our ability to connect."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "First of all, let's talk about other biological systems like dogs, our ability to love things that are very different than humans."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "But they do display emotion, right?"}, {"time": 7220, "text": "I mean, dogs do display emotion."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "So they don't have to be anthropomorphic for them to like display the kind of emotions that we don't."}, {"time": 7229, "text": "So, I mean, but then the word emotion starts to lose."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "So then we have to be, I guess specific, but yeah."}, {"time": 7236, "text": "So have rich flavorful communication."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Communication, yeah."}, {"time": 7240, "text": "Yeah, so like, yes, it's full of emotion."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "It's full of wit and humor and moods and all those kinds of things, yeah."}, {"time": 7250, "text": "So you're talking about like flavor."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "Flavor, yeah."}, {"time": 7254, "text": "Okay, let's call it that."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "So there's content and then there is flavor and I'm talking about the flavor."}, {"time": 7258, "text": "Do you think it needs to have a body?"}, {"time": 7260, "text": "Do you think like to interact with the physical world?"}, {"time": 7262, "text": "Do you think you can understand the physical world without being able to directly interact with it?"}, {"time": 7267, "text": "I don't think so, yeah."}, {"time": 7268, "text": "I think at some point we will need to bite the bullet and actually interact with the physical, as much as I like working on like passive computer vision where I just like sit in my arm chair and look at videos and learn."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "I do think that we will need to have some kind of embodiment or some kind of interaction to figure out things about the world."}, {"time": 7288, "text": "Do you think, how often do you think about consciousness when you think about your work?"}, {"time": 7294, "text": "You could think of it as the more simple thing of self awareness, of being aware that you are a perceiving, sensing, acting thing in this world."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "Or you can think about the bigger version of that, which is consciousness, which is having it feel like something to be that entity, the subjective experience of being in this world."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "So I think of self awareness a little bit more than like the broader goal of it, because I think self awareness is pretty critical for like any kind of like any kind of AGI or whatever you want to call it that we build, because it needs to contextualize what it is and what role it's playing with respect to all the other things that exist around it."}, {"time": 7337, "text": "I think that requires self awareness."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "It needs to understand that it's an autonomous car, right?"}, {"time": 7346, "text": "What are the things that it is supposed to do and so on?"}, {"time": 7349, "text": "What is its role in some way?"}, {"time": 7350, "text": "Or, I mean, these are the kinds of things that we kind of expect from it, I would say."}, {"time": 7356, "text": "And so that's the level of self awareness that's, I would say, basically required at least, if not more than that."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "Yeah, I tend to, on the emotion side, believe that it has to have, it has to be able to display consciousness."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "Display consciousness, what do you mean by that?"}, {"time": 7374, "text": "Meaning like for us humans to connect with each other or to connect with other living entities, I think we need to feel, like in order for us to truly feel like that there's another being there, we have to believe that they're conscious."}, {"time": 7391, "text": "And so we won't ever connect with something that doesn't have elements of consciousness."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "Now I tend to think that that's easier to achieve than it may sound, because we anthropomorphize stuff so hard."}, {"time": 7405, "text": "Like you have a mug that just like has wheels and like rotates every once in a while and makes a sound."}, {"time": 7411, "text": "I think a couple of days in, especially if you don't hang out with humans, you might start to believe that mug on wheels is conscious."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "So I think we anthropomorphize pretty effectively as human beings."}, {"time": 7426, "text": "But I do think that it's in the same bucket that we'll call emotion, that show that you're, I think of consciousness as the capacity to suffer."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "And if you're an entity that's able to feel things in the world and to communicate that to others, I think that's a really powerful way to interact with humans."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "And in order to create an AGI system, I believe you should be able to richly interact with humans."}, {"time": 7458, "text": "Like humans would need to want to interact with you."}, {"time": 7461, "text": "Like it can't be like, it's the self supervised learning versus like, like the robot shouldn't have to pay you to interact with me."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "So like it should be a natural fun thing."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "And then you're going to scale up significantly how much interaction it gets."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "It's the Alexa prize, which they were trying to get me to be a judge on their contest."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "Let's see if I want to do that."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "But their challenge is to talk to you, make the human sufficiently interested that the human keeps talking for 20 minutes."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "To Alexa?"}, {"time": 7497, "text": "To Alexa, yeah."}, {"time": 7498, "text": "And right now they're not even close to that because it just gets so boring when you're like, when the intelligence is not there, it gets very not interesting to talk to it."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And so the robot needs to be interesting."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "And one of the ways it can be interesting is display the capacity to love, to suffer."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "And I would say that essentially means the capacity to display consciousness."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "Like it is an entity, much like a human being."}, {"time": 7525, "text": "Of course, what that really means, I don't know if that's fundamentally a robotics problem or some kind of problem that we're not yet even aware."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "Like if it is truly a hard problem of consciousness, I tend to maybe optimistically think it's a, we can pretty effectively fake it till we make it."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "So we can display a lot of human like elements for a while."}, {"time": 7546, "text": "And that will be sufficient to form really close connections with humans."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "What's used the most beautiful idea in self supervised learning?"}, {"time": 7555, "text": "Like when you sit back with, I don't know, with a glass of wine and an armchair and just at a fireplace, just thinking how beautiful this world that you get to explore is, what do you think is the especially beautiful idea?"}, {"time": 7573, "text": "The fact that like object level, what objects are and some notion of objectness emerges from these models by just like self supervised learning."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "So for example, like one of the things like the dyno paper that I was a part of at Facebook is the object sort of boundaries emerge from these representations."}, {"time": 7595, "text": "So if you have like a dog running in the field, the boundaries around the dog, the network is basically able to figure out what the boundaries of this dog are automatically."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "And it was never trained to do that."}, {"time": 7607, "text": "It was never trained to, no one taught it that this is a dog and these pixels belong to a dog."}, {"time": 7612, "text": "It's able to group these things together automatically."}, {"time": 7616, "text": "I think in general, that entire notion that this dumb idea that you take like these two crops of an image and then you say that the features should be similar, that has resulted in something like this, like the model is able to figure out what the dog pixels are and so on."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "That just seems like so surprising."}, {"time": 7633, "text": "And I mean, I don't think a lot of us even understand how that is happening really."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "And it's something we are taking for granted, maybe like a lot in terms of how we're setting up these algorithms, but it's just, it's a very beautiful and powerful idea."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "So it's really fundamentally telling us something about that there is so much signal in the pixels that we can be super dumb about it."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "How about how we are setting up the self sequencing problem."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "And despite being like super dumb about it, we'll actually get very good, like we'll actually get something that is able to do very like surprising things."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "I wonder if there's other like objectness of other concepts that can emerge."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "I don't know if you follow Francois Chollet, he had the competition for intelligence that basically it's kind of like an IQ test, but for machines, but for an IQ test, you have to have a few concepts that you want to apply."}, {"time": 7685, "text": "One of them is objectness."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "I wonder if those concepts can emerge through self supervised learning on billions of images."}, {"time": 7694, "text": "I think something like object permanence can definitely emerge, right?"}, {"time": 7697, "text": "So that's like a fundamental concept which we have, maybe not through images, through video, but that's another concept that should be emerging from it because it's not something that, like if we don't teach humans that this isn't, this is like about this concept of object permanence, it actually emerges."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "And the same thing for like animals, like dogs, I think actually permanence automatically is something that they are born with."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "So I think it should emerge from the data."}, {"time": 7720, "text": "It should emerge basically very quickly."}, {"time": 7722, "text": "I wonder if ideas like symmetry, rotation, these kinds of things might emerge."}, {"time": 7727, "text": "So I think rotation, probably yes."}, {"time": 7730, "text": "Yeah, rotation, yes."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "I mean, there's some constraints in the architecture itself, but it's interesting if all of them could be, like counting was another one, being able to kind of understand that there's multiple objects of the same kind in the image and be able to count them."}, {"time": 7750, "text": "I wonder if all of that could be, if constructed correctly, they can emerge because then you can transfer those concepts to then interpret images at a deeper level."}, {"time": 7761, "text": "Counting, I do believe, I mean, it should be possible."}, {"time": 7764, "text": "You don't know like yet, but I do think it's not that far in the realm of possibility."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "Yeah, that'd be interesting if using self supervised learning on images can then be applied to then solving those kinds of IQ tests, which seem currently to be kind of impossible."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "What idea do you believe might be true that most people think is not true or don't agree with you on?"}, {"time": 7788, "text": "Is there something like that?"}, {"time": 7790, "text": "So this is going to be a little controversial, but okay, sure."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "I don't believe in simulation."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "Like actually using simulation to do things very much."}, {"time": 7798, "text": "Just to clarify, because this is a podcast where you talk about, are we living in a simulation often?"}, {"time": 7803, "text": "You're referring to using simulation to construct worlds that you then leverage for machine learning."}, {"time": 7811, "text": "For example, like one example would be like to train an autonomous car driving system."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "You basically first build a simulator, which builds like the environment of the world."}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And then you basically have a lot of like, you train your machine learning system in that."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "So I believe it is possible, but I think it's a really expensive way of doing things."}, {"time": 7830, "text": "And at the end of it, you do need the real world."}, {"time": 7833, "text": "So I'm not sure."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "So maybe for certain settings, like maybe the payout is so large, like for autonomous driving, the payout is so large that you can actually invest that much money to build it."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "But I think as a general sort of principle, it does not apply to a lot of concepts."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "You can't really build simulations of everything."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Not only because like one, it's expensive, because second, it's also not possible for a lot of things."}, {"time": 7854, "text": "So in general, like there's a lot of work on like using synthetic data and like synthetic simulators."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "I generally am not very, like I don't believe in that."}, {"time": 7865, "text": "So you're saying it's very challenging visually, like to correctly like simulate the visual, like the lighting, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7873, "text": "I mean, all these companies that you have, right?"}, {"time": 7875, "text": "So like Pixar and like whatever, all these companies are, all this like computer graphics stuff is really about accurately, a lot of them is about like accurately trying to figure out how the lighting is and like how things reflect off of one another and so on, and like how sparkly things look and so on."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "So it's a very hard problem."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "So do we really need to solve that first to be able to like do computer vision?"}, {"time": 7900, "text": "And for me, in the context of autonomous driving, it's very tempting to be able to use simulation, right?"}, {"time": 7908, "text": "Because it's a safety critical application, but the other limitation of simulation that perhaps is a bigger one than the visual limitation is the behavior of objects."}, {"time": 7920, "text": "So you're ultimately interested in edge cases."}, {"time": 7923, "text": "And the question is, how well can you generate edge cases in simulation, especially with human behavior?"}, {"time": 7931, "text": "I think another problem is like for autonomous driving, it's a constantly changing world."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "So say autonomous driving like in 10 years from now, like there are lots of autonomous cars, but they're still going to be humans."}, {"time": 7942, "text": "So now there are 50% of the agents say, which are humans, 50% of the agents that are autonomous, like car driving agents."}, {"time": 7948, "text": "So now the mixture has changed."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "So now the kinds of behaviors that you actually expect from the other agents or other cars on the road are actually going to be very different."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "And as the proportion of the number of autonomous cars to humans keeps changing, this behavior will actually change a lot."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "So now if you were to build a simulator based on just like right now to build them today, you don't have that many autonomous cars on the road."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "So you would try to like make all of the other agents in that simulator behave as humans, but that's not really going to hold true 10, 15, 20, 30 years from now."}, {"time": 7981, "text": "How hard is it?"}, {"time": 7982, "text": "This is why I think it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "How hard is it to build a video game, like virtual reality game where it is so real, forget like ultra realistic to where you can't tell the difference, but like it's so nice that you just want to stay there."}, {"time": 8000, "text": "You just want to stay there and you don't want to come back."}, {"time": 8004, "text": "Do you think that's doable within our lifetime?"}, {"time": 8009, "text": "Within our lifetime, probably."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "I eat healthy, I live long."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "Does that make you sad that there'll be like like population of kids that basically spend 95%, 99% of their time in a virtual world?"}, {"time": 8030, "text": "Very, very hard question to answer."}, {"time": 8033, "text": "For certain people, it might be something that they really derive a lot of value out of, derive a lot of enjoyment and like happiness out of, and maybe the real world wasn't giving them that."}, {"time": 8043, "text": "That's why they did that."}, {"time": 8043, "text": "So maybe it is good for certain people."}, {"time": 8045, "text": "So ultimately, if it maximizes happiness, Right, I think if."}, {"time": 8050, "text": "Or we could judge."}, {"time": 8051, "text": "Yeah, I think if it's making people happy, maybe it's okay."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "Again, I think this is a very hard question."}, {"time": 8058, "text": "So like you've been a part of a lot of amazing papers."}, {"time": 8063, "text": "What advice would you give to somebody on what it takes to write a good paper?"}, {"time": 8069, "text": "Grad students writing papers now, is there common things that you've learned along the way that you think it takes, both for a good idea and a good paper?"}, {"time": 8079, "text": "Right, so I think both of these have picked up from like lots of people I've worked with in the past."}, {"time": 8086, "text": "So one of them is picking the right problem to work on in research is as important as like finding the solution to it."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "So I mean, there are multiple reasons for this."}, {"time": 8096, "text": "So one is that there are certain problems that can actually be solved in a particular timeframe."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "So now say you want to work on finding the meaning of life."}, {"time": 8106, "text": "This is a great problem."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "I think most people will agree with that."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "But do you believe that your talents and like the energy that you'll spend on it will make some kind of meaningful progress in your lifetime?"}, {"time": 8118, "text": "If you are optimistic about it, then go ahead."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "That's why I started this podcast."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "I keep asking people about the meaning of life."}, {"time": 8124, "text": "I'm hoping by episode like 2.20, I'll figure it out."}, {"time": 8127, "text": "Oh, not too many episodes to go."}, {"time": 8131, "text": "Maybe today, I don't know, but you're right."}, {"time": 8133, "text": "So that seems intractable at the moment."}, {"time": 8136, "text": "Right, so I think it's just the fact of like, if you're starting a PhD, for example, what is one problem that you want to focus on that you do think is interesting enough, and you will be able to make a reasonable amount of headway into it that you think you'll be doing a PhD for?"}, {"time": 8150, "text": "So in that kind of a timeframe."}, {"time": 8153, "text": "Of course, there's the second part, which is what excites you genuinely."}, {"time": 8156, "text": "So you shouldn't just pick problems that you are not excited about, because as a grad student or as a researcher, you really need to be passionate about it to continue doing that, because there are so many other things that you could be doing in life."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "So you really need to believe in that to be able to do that for that long."}, {"time": 8170, "text": "In terms of papers, I think the one thing that I've learned is, like in the past, whenever I used to write things, and even now, whenever I do that, I try to cram in a lot of things into the paper, whereas what really matters is just pushing one simple idea, that's it."}, {"time": 8185, "text": "That's all because the paper is going to be like, whatever, eight or nine pages."}, {"time": 8192, "text": "If you keep cramming in lots of ideas, it's really hard for the single thing that you believe in to stand out."}, {"time": 8222, "text": "So as a grad student, I used to always wait to it, maybe in the last week or whatever, to write the paper, because I used to always believe that doing the experiments was actually the bigger part of research than writing."}, {"time": 8233, "text": "And my advisor always told me that you should start writing very early on, and I thought, oh, it doesn't matter, I don't know what he's talking about."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "But I think more and more I realized that's the case."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "Whenever I write something that I'm doing, I actually think much better about it."}, {"time": 8246, "text": "And so if you start writing early on, you actually, I think, get better ideas, or at least you figure out holes in your theory, or particular experiments that you should run to plug those holes, and so on."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "Yeah, I'm continually surprised how many really good papers throughout history are quite short and quite simple."}, {"time": 8268, "text": "And there's a lesson to that."}, {"time": 8270, "text": "If you want to dream about writing a paper that changes the world, and you wanna go by example, they're usually simple."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And that's, it's not cramming, or it's focusing on one idea, and thinking deeply."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "And you're right that the writing process itself reveals the idea."}, {"time": 8292, "text": "It challenges you to really think about what is the idea that explains it, the thread that ties it all together."}, {"time": 8299, "text": "And so a lot of famous researchers I know actually would start off, like, first they were, even before the experiments were in, a lot of them would actually start with writing the introduction of the paper, with zero experiments in."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "Because that at least helps them figure out what they're trying to solve, and how it fits in the context of things right now."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "And that would really guide their entire research."}, {"time": 8320, "text": "So a lot of them would actually first write in intros with zero experiments in, and that's how they would start projects."}, {"time": 8326, "text": "Some basic questions about people maybe that are more like beginners in this field."}, {"time": 8331, "text": "What's the best programming language to learn if you're interested in machine learning?"}, {"time": 8336, "text": "I would say Python, just because it's the easiest one to learn."}, {"time": 8340, "text": "And also a lot of like programming and machine learning happens in Python."}, {"time": 8345, "text": "So if you don't know any other programming language, Python is actually going to get you a long way."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "Yeah, it seems like sort of a, it's a toss up question because it seems like Python is so much dominating the space now."}, {"time": 8356, "text": "But I wonder if there's an interesting alternative."}, {"time": 8358, "text": "Obviously there's like Swift, and there's a lot of interesting alternatives popping up, even JavaScript."}, {"time": 8363, "text": "So I, or are more like for the data science applications."}, {"time": 8368, "text": "But it seems like Python more and more is actually being used to teach like introduction to programming at universities."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "So it just combines everything very nicely."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "Even harder question."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "What are the pros and cons of PyTorch versus TensorFlow?"}, {"time": 8389, "text": "You can go with no comment."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "So a disclaimer to this is that the last time I used TensorFlow was probably like four years ago."}, {"time": 8396, "text": "And so it was right when it had come out because so I started on like deep learning in 2014 or so, and the dominant sort of framework for us then for vision was Cafe, which was out of Berkeley."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "And we used Cafe a lot, it was really nice."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "And then TensorFlow came in, which was basically like Python first."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "So Cafe was mainly C++, and it had like very loose kind of Python binding."}, {"time": 8419, "text": "So Python wasn't really the first language you would use."}, {"time": 8421, "text": "You would really use either MATLAB or C++ like get stuff done in like Cafe."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "And then Python of course became popular a little bit later."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "So TensorFlow was basically around that time."}, {"time": 8432, "text": "So 2015, 2016 is when I last used it."}, {"time": 8436, "text": "It's been a while."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "And then what, did you use Torch or did you?"}, {"time": 8440, "text": "So then I moved to LuaTorch, which was the torch in Lua."}, {"time": 8444, "text": "And then in 2017, I think basically pretty much to PyTorch completely."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "So you went to Lua, cool."}, {"time": 8451, "text": "Huh, so you were there before it was cool."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "Yeah, I mean, so LuaTorch was really good because it actually allowed you to do a lot of different kinds of things."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "So which Cafe was very rigid in terms of its structure."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "Like you would create a neural network once and that's it."}, {"time": 8466, "text": "Whereas if you wanted like very dynamic graphs and so on, it was very hard to do that."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "And LuaTorch was much more friendly for all of these things."}, {"time": 8473, "text": "Okay, so in terms of PyTorch and TensorFlow, my personal bias is PyTorch just because I've been using it longer and I'm more familiar with it."}, {"time": 8480, "text": "And also that PyTorch is much easier to debug is what I find because it's imperative in nature compared to like TensorFlow, which is not imperative."}, {"time": 8488, "text": "But that's telling you a lot that basically the imperative design is sort of a way in which a lot of people are taught programming and that's what actually makes debugging easier for them."}, {"time": 8498, "text": "So like I learned programming in C, C++."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "And so for me, imperative way of programming is more natural."}, {"time": 8504, "text": "Do you think it's good to have kind of these two communities, this kind of competition?"}, {"time": 8508, "text": "I think PyTorch is kind of more and more becoming dominant in the research community, but TensorFlow is still very popular in the more sort of application machine learning community."}, {"time": 8517, "text": "So do you think it's good to have that kind of split in code bases?"}, {"time": 8522, "text": "Or so like the benefit there is the competition challenges the library developers to step up to a game."}, {"time": 8529, "text": "But the downside is there's these code bases that are in different libraries."}, {"time": 8535, "text": "Right, so I think the downside is that, I mean, for a lot of research code that's released in one framework and if you're using the other one, it's really hard to like really build on top of it."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "But thankfully the open source community in machine learning is amazing."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "So whenever like something pops up in TensorFlow, you wait a few days and someone who's like super sharp will actually come and translate that particular code based into PyTorch and basically have figured that all the nooks and crannies out."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "So the open source community is amazing and they really like figure out this gap."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "So I think in terms of like having these two frameworks or multiple, I think of course there are different use cases so there are going to be benefits to using one or the other framework."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "And like you said, I think competition is just healthy because both of these frameworks keep or like all of these frameworks really sort of keep learning from each other and keep incorporating different things to just make them better and better."}, {"time": 8583, "text": "What advice would you have for someone new to machine learning, you know, maybe just started or haven't even started but are

"text": "So if something doesn't work, like really drill into why things are not working."}, {"time": 8602, "text": "Can you elaborate what your hands dirty means?"}, {"time": 8604, "text": "Right, so for example, like if an algorithm, if you try to train the network and it's not converging, whatever, rather than trying to like Google the answer or trying to do something, like really spend those like five, eight, 10, 15, 20, whatever number of hours really trying to figure it out yourself."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "Because in that process, you'll actually learn a lot more."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "Googling is of course like a good way to solve it when you need a quick answer."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "But I think initially, especially like when you're starting out, it's much nicer to like figure things out by yourself."}, {"time": 8631, "text": "And I just say that from experience because like when I started out, there were not a lot of resources."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "So we would like in the lab, a lot of us, like we would look up to senior students and then the senior students were of course busy and they would be like, hey, why don't you go figure it out?"}, {"time": 8643, "text": "Because I just don't have the time."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "I'm working on my dissertation or whatever."}, {"time": 8646, "text": "I'll find a PhD students."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "And so then we would sit down and like just try to figure it out."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "And that I think really helped me."}, {"time": 8652, "text": "That has really helped me figure a lot of things out."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "I think in general, if I were to generalize that, I feel like persevering through any kind of struggle on a thing you care about is good."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "So you're basically, you try to make it seem like it's good to spend time debugging, but really any kind of struggle, whatever form that takes, it could be just Googling a lot."}, {"time": 8676, "text": "Just basically anything, just sticking with it and going through the hard thing that could take a form of implementing stuff from scratch."}, {"time": 8683, "text": "It could take the form of re implementing with different libraries or different programming languages."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "It could take a lot of different forms, but struggle is good for the soul."}, {"time": 8693, "text": "So like in Pittsburgh, where I did my PhD, the thing was it used to snow a lot."}, {"time": 8698, "text": "And so when it was snowed, you really couldn't do much."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "So the thing that a lot of people said was snow builds character."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "Because when it's snowing, you can't do anything else."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "You focus on work."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "Do you have advice in general for people, you've already exceptionally successful, you're young, but do you have advice for young people starting out in college or

hungry."}, {"time": 8727, "text": "Always be hungry for what you want."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "And I think I've been inspired by a lot of people who are just driven and who really go for what they want, no matter what, like you shouldn't want it, you should need it."}, {"time": 8740, "text": "So if you need something, you basically go towards the ends to make it work."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "How do you know when you come across a thing that's like you need?"}, {"time": 8751, "text": "I think there's not going to be any single thing that you're going to need."}, {"time": 8753, "text": "There are going to be different types of things that you need, but whenever you need something, you just go push for it."}, {"time": 8757, "text": "And of course, once you, you may not get it, or you may find that this was not even the thing that you were looking for, it might be a different thing."}, {"time": 8763, "text": "But the point is like you're pushing through things and that actually brings a lot of skills and builds a certain kind of attitude which will probably help you get the other thing once you figure out what's really the thing that you want."}, {"time": 8778, "text":

at Blue Operations during this time was George Dyson, the son of Freeman."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old film that they'd shot on a beach in La

layer of steam that becomes plasma."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And plasma is opaque because it conducts."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the

insects, also had terrible effects on bird populations."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So the kind of backlash that happened in the 70s that is still kind of going on is to sort of assume that everything is a double edged sword and always to look for, we have to absolutely convince ourselves that the downside isn't going to come back and bite us before we can adopt any new technology."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "And I think the people are overly sensitized to that now."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "Yeah, it's funny, depending on the technology, people are a little bit too terrified of certain

things."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "It's probably impossible to predict exactly the unintended negative consequences."}, {"time": 3996, "text": "But what's also interesting is for AI as an example,

about all the negative effects of social media."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "We've immediately forgotten how incredible it is to connect across the world."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "There's a deep

step one of solving a problem is bringing it to the surface."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "The fact that there's a division, the fact that we're easily angered and upset and all of that, the witch hunts, all those kinds of things, that's human nature and it just reveals that allowing us to now work on it, it's therapy."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "And so that's another example of a technology that's just, we're not considering the positive effects now and in the future enough of."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "I have to ask you about, there's a million things I can ask you about, but virtual reality,

of all time."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "Chief Futurist?"}, {"time": 4105, "text": "And so I sort of had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content R&D, so we're trying to make content for AR, but because it's such a new medium, it's more of an engineering R&D project almost than a creative project."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into making an AR system that runs."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "So AR, an AR device, if it's really gonna do AR, needs to be running Slam in real time."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "And that alone is a big..."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "So for people who don't know, first of all, virtual reality is creating an almost fully artificial world and putting you inside it."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "Augmented reality, AR, is taking the real world and putting stuff on top of that real world, and when you say Slam, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to sense, accurately detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct the 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And doing that in real time, presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human perception system is, yeah, that's an engineering project."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "Yeah, well said, and it's just one of the things that the system has to do."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're looking at is."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "It's performing all those functions, and it's got to keep doing that without burning up the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast, and that's just table stakes."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "It's just the basic functions of the operating system, and then any content that you want to add has to sit on top of that."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "It's got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real and you don't get sick."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "So it's an amazing thing, and a magically shipped device that can do that in 2019."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "And they're about to ship the ML2, but I don't know any more about that than anyone else because I don't work there anymore."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "Does it still, to some degree, boil down to a killer app, a content question?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "Like you said, it's kind of a wide open space."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "Nobody knows exactly what's going to be the compelling thing."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "So doesn't a super compelling experience of some sort alleviate some of the need for engineering perfection?"}, {"time": 4294, "text": "Well, there's a base layer of engineering that you have to have no matter what, but you're certainly right that people, like in the early days of video games, put up with kind of low frame rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having so much fun playing Doom or whatever."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "Even Tetris."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "So for sure that's true."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "And so I was working on consumer facing content, there was a great team in Wellington, New Zealand that made a game called Dr. Groydbrod's Invaders that realized the potential of AR gaming in a way that I don't think anything else has before or since."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "And so that was definitely the strategy until, what, April 2020, which is when the company decided to pivot to commercial industrial applications instead."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And I haven't seen their financial projections, but I assume they had good reasons for making that strategic decision."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "It just means that it's no longer necessarily targeted at just end users who want to play a game or be entertained."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "That to me from a dreamer, futurist perspective is heartbreaking because I don't know necessarily from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics where to me the future of robotics is consumer facing and a lot of great roboticists,

4435, "text": "It was a fun project."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "We worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats, which just populated your room with baby goats."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "That seemed like a killer app right there."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "No, we thought highly of the idea for sure."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "But because of the SLAM, the system knew, for example, here's a table, here's a little end table."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "We know the heights."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "We know how high our animated baby goat can jump."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So our engineers had to build a system for converting the SLAM primitives into game engine objects that the AIs in the game could navigate around."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how to a sample app than as a finished consumer facing."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "You mean the baby goat AI?"}, {"time": 4504, "text": "That seems to me like a world I could entertain myself for hours, just every day coming home to see baby goats."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "I mean, it was an ambient kind of..."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "It's not a thing that you would sit there and play like a video."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "But now there's baby goats."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "I mean, what's the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life exactly?"},

or something for a while if you want, but you don't have to."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling in a fictional universe."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "The hardware is worth a look."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "There's still a belief, I just saw it this morning looking at Twitter, that the Magic League never shipped anything."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "But they've been, since 2019, you can go to their website and buy one of these devices anytime you want to spend the money."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "And the new one is coming out, I think in 2022, so in a few months."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "What do you think, looking out 50 years from now, what wins?"}, {"time": 4584, "text": "Virtual reality, augmented reality, or physical reality?"}, {"time": 4590, "text": "What wins?"}, {"time": 4592, "text": "Meaning like, what do people that have financial resources enjoy spending most of their time in?"}, {"time": 4603, "text": "I've always been a fan of AR and it's kind of an easy answer because if you're wearing an AR device and you put a bag over your head, it becomes a VR device."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "If you block out what's really there, then all you're seeing is a VR."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "But you are, with AR, constrained to kind of operate in something that's similar to physical reality."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "But there are still issues in those fantastical worlds with motion sickness."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "If your

doesn't mean you can't do it, it's just a constraint that VR designers have to learn to work with."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "So do you think it's possible that in the future, we're living mostly in a virtual reality world?"}, {"time": 4680, "text": "Like, we become more and more detached from physical reality?"}, {"time": 4684, "text": "For entertainment, maybe, for certain applications, I'm personally more, I mean, we have to make a distinction between what I would personally find interesting and what might win in the market."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So maybe some people, maybe lots of people, would like to spend a huge amount of time in VR."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "I'm personally more interested in enhancing the experience that I have of the physical world, because the physical

bad, for some reason, like you're trying to escape it."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "Like, literally, it's just more enriching."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "In the same way, like, there's a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical world."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "Like, double up on that glimmer for the virtual reality."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "Can you imagine such a world?"}, {"time": 4763, "text": "Well, like, I'll give maybe an example that's a bridge, which is that I like making things."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "So I like working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "And so I've had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "There's many to choose from."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "I use one called Fusion 360."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "And I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and create the things I want to create."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "And it's not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time, my whole field of view is occupied by this monitor that's showing me a window into a three dimensional space."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "I'm rotating things around."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "I'm imagining things."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "I'm making things."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "And so that is pretty close to being in virtual reality."},

print it and touch it?"}, {"time": 4841, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's my game."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "That's what I'm up to."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "But it happens that if you're building a virtual environment, if you're making a game level or creating a virtual set for a film or TV production, the thing that you're designing in the program may never physically exist."}, {"time": 4864,

people spend a good chunk of their working hours in something that's pretty close to VR."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "It's just that currently the output device happens to be a rectangular object in front of them."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "You could replace that with a VR headset and they'd be doing the same stuff."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "There's all kinds of interfaces."}, {"time": 4900,

way."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "But you get to learn about the person you're listening to and that's a real connection and that's just audio."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "For a lot of people, that's just audio."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "And for me, that's just audio as a fan of people and you kind of a little bit are friends with those people."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "Yeah, they're in your

yet."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "And also something to strive for to be able to do that."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "I mean, you know, there is the other view that the universe is just too big and life

but there is this thing that they see, but they don't see."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "And it takes a bit of time and you just have to keep reframing it."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?"}, {"time": 5065, "text": "Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?"}, {"time": 5069, "text": "I mean, who said?"}, {"time": 5070, "text": "Does

that must be the only way to have life."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "But you mentioned assembly theory."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "Well, first let me pause, bathroom break, needed?"}, {"time": 5097, "text": "Yeah, let's take two minutes."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "We took a quick break and offline, you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "And then I said that you're basically Rick from Rick and Morty, which is something I've been thinking this whole conversation."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "And then you say that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "I don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation?"}, {"time": 5131, "text": "And is there many, arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?"}, {"time": 5137, "text": "I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home using a pickle and the only way I could get any traction with

"text": "They're not impressed with anything I do, any experiments I do at home."}, {"time": 5157, "text": "I think it's quite funny."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "But you connected a pickle to some electrode."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "240 volts, yeah, AC."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "And then had a couple of electrodes on it."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "So what happens is a pickle, this is a classic thing you do."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do, you put a pickle into the mains and just leave it, run away and leave it."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "And what happens is it starts to decompose."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "It heats up and then explodes because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "But I wondered

home is I have a kind of electronics workshop and I prototype experiments there."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "Then I try and then I try and suggest to my team sometimes, maybe we can try this thing."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "And they would just say, oh, wow, that's not gonna work because of this."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried and here's some code and here's some hardware."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "Can we have a go?"}, {"time": 5235, "text": "So I'm doing that less and less now as I get even more busy, but that's quite fun because they feel that we're in the experiment together."}, {"time": 5244, "text": "You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick from Rick and Morty, connect up chemistry with computation."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "And when we say chemistry, we don't mean the simulation of chemistry, a modeling of chemistry."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "We mean chemistry in the physical space as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "But first you mentioned assembly theory."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "So we'll stick on theory in these big ideas."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "I would say revolutionary ideas, this intersection between mathematics and philosophy."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "What is assembly theory?"}, {"time": 5289, "text": "And generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it?"}, {"time": 5295, "text": "So assembly theory is a theory, goes back a few years now in my struggle for maybe almost 10 years when I was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences, where I thought that everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does."}, {"time": 5312, "text": "But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is because I think it's easier."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "So assembly theory literally says if you take an object, any given object, and you are able to break the object into parts very gently."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So just maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point, and it will fragment into many parts."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "And if that object is able to fragment into many, and you count those parts, the different parts, so they're unsymmetrical, assembly theory says the larger the number of parts, unsymmetrical parts that object has, the more likely it is that object has been created by an evolutionary or information process, especially if that object is not one off, you've got an abundance of them."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "So because what I'm literally saying about the abundance, if you have a one off object and you break it into parts and it has lots of parts, you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "And I was troubled with this for years because I saw in reality that assembly theory works."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "But when I talked to very good computational complexity computation lists, algorithmic complexity people, they said, you haven't really done this properly."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "It's like, this is the random problem."}, {"time": 5397, "text": "And so I kept working this up because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "And so the thought experiment was, how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance, probabilistically."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "And if I found this molecule, able to detect it enough quantities in the same object, like a machine, like a mass spectrometer."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "So typically in a mass spectrometer, you weigh the molecules in electric field."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "You probably have to have all the order of 10,000 identical molecules to get a signal."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "What is the chance of them occurring by chance?"}, {"time": 5436, "text": "Well, we can do the math."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "Let's take a molecule like strychnine or, yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take or Viagra is a good molecule."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "I made jokes about Viagra because it's a complex molecule."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "And one of my friends said, yeah, if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities, we know something is up."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "And yeah, but anyway, it's a complex molecule."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "So what you do is you take this molecule in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons or in electric field and it breaks apart."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And if the larger the number of different parts, you know when it starts to get refreshed, my idea was that that molecule could not be created by chance, probabilistically."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So that was where assembly theory was born in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "And I was thinking about this because NASA is sending mass spectrometers to Mars, to Titan, it's gonna send them to Europa."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "There's gonna be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer going to Titan."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "They're not only sending a drone that's gonna fly around Titan, it's gonna be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery, and it's gonna have a mass spectrometer on it."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Is this already launched?"}, {"time": 5507, "text": "No, it's Dragonfly and it's gonna be launched in a few years."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "So I think it's three or four years."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan and collect data about the composition of the various chemicals on Titan."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA."}, {"time": 5531, "text": "I don't know if I'll be able to convince the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach, but they will get data."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "And depending on how good their mass spectrometer is."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "But I had this thought experiment anyway, and I did this thought experiment."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "And for me, it seemed to work."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm in assembly theory."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "And I basically, assembly theory, if I take, let's just make it generic."}, {"time": 5553, "text": "And so let's just take the word abracadabra."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "Say, can I, if you find the word, so if you have a book with lots of words in it and you find abracadabra one off, and it's a rap book that's been written by, in a random way, set of monkeys in a room."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "And you're on typewriters."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "And you find one off abracadabra, no big deal."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means something weird is going on."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "So abracadabra has a number of letters in it."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "You can break it down."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So you just cut the letters up."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "But when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So you'd have an A, a B, and keep going up."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "When you cut abracadabra up into parts, you can put it together again in seven steps."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "That means if you basically don't, you're allowed to reuse things you make in a chain at the beginning."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "That's the memory of the universe, the process that makes abracadabra."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "And because of that causal chain, you can then get to abracadabra quicker than the number of letters for having to specify only in seven."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "So if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts, and you can, on the causal chain, and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds, and then you randomly add on those parts to make the A, make the B, and keep going all the way up, I found that literally, assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "So when there's some information in there."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "And I realized assembly theory isn't just confined to molecular space."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "It can apply to anything."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "But let me finish the molecular argument."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "So what I did is I had this theory."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "I, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm."}, {"time": 5662, "text": "We basically took the 20 million molecules from a database and we just calculate their assembly number."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "And that's the index."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "Like basically, if I take a molecule and I cut it up into bonds, what is the minimum number of steps I need to take to reform that molecule from atoms?"}, {"time": 5679, "text": "So reusability of previously formed things is somehow a fundamental part of what it is."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "Exactly, it's like a memory in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 5686, "text": "I'm making lots of leaps here."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "Like, it's kind of weird."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "I'm saying, right, there's a process that can form the A and the B and the C, let's say."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And then because we've formed A and B before, we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "So that's the kind of what the chain of events."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "And that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe, when you talk about the universe or life is the universe creating memory."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "So we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "We were able to classify it."}, {"time": 5718, "text": "So, okay, let's test it."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "So we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules and assign an assembly index to them, okay?"}, {"time": 5727, "text": "And it's just a function of the number of bonds in the molecule and how much symmetry."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "So literally assembly theory is a measure of how little symmetry a molecule has."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "And so the more asymmetry, the more information, the more weird it is, like a Jackson Pollock of some description."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "So I then went and did a load of experiments."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "And I basically took those molecules, I cut them up in the mass spec and measured the number of peaks without any knowledge of the molecule."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "And we found the assembly number, there was almost not quite a one to one correlation, but almost because not all bonds are equal."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "They have different energies."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques, NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and get a signature out."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "And I also used infrared."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one correlation."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "So what am I saying?"}, {"time": 5779, "text": "Saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec, I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule and then put it on a scale."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "And what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the environment, from outer space, from all around earth, from the sea, from Antarctica, and from fossils and so on."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And even NASA, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples."}, {"time": 5811, "text": "And we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a very high assembly number above a threshold of about 15."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "So basically all the stuff that came from an ebiotic origin was low."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "There was no complexity there."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So we suddenly realized that on earth at least, there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules that need more than 15 steps to make them."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life, a scale of technology as well."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "And literally you could just go sniffing for molecules off earth, on Titan, on Mars."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than 15 parts, you'll know pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "And this allowed me to come up with a general definition of life based on assembly theory, to say that if I find an object that has a large number of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747, or any complex object and I can find it in abundance and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced by an informational process or not."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "And that's what assembly theory kind of does."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "But it goes a bit further."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "I then realized that this isn't just about life, it's about causation."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "So actually it tells you about whether it's a causal structure."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "So now I can look at objects in the universe, say that again, this cup and say, right, I'm gonna look at how many independent parts it has."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "So that's the assembly number."}, {"time": 5905, "text": "I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups?"}, {"time": 5908, "text": "There are two on this table, maybe there's a few more you got stashed away."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object times the number of copy numbers of that object or a function of the copy number normalized."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "You have energy, entropy, and assembly."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "So assembly, the way we should think about that is how much reusability there is."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "Because reusability is like, can you play devil's advocate to this?"}, {"time": 5939, "text": "So could this just be a nice tertiary signal for living organisms?"}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Like some kind of distant signal that's, yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something fundamental."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "Or do you think reusability is something fundamental to life and complex organisms?"}, {"time": 5962, "text": "I think reusability is fundamental in the universe, not just for life and complex organisms."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "It's about causation."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "So I think assembly tells you if you find objects, cause you can do this with trajectories as well."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "You think about it, that the fact there are objects in the universe on earth is weird."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "You think about it, we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "The fact that not everything exists is really weird."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "Now then."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "And then as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles and the things that exist kind of are similar and multiply in copies of each other."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "So I would say that assembly allows you to do something that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "So I'm making, it's pretty bold."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker on this at the moment."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "And we're realizing, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves because I think that there's lots of ways where this is, you know, it's a really interesting idea."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "It works for molecules and it appears to work for any objects produced by causation."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "Cause you can take a motor car, you can look at the assembly of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "Assembly theory tells you there's a way of compressing and reusing."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "And so when people, I talk to information theorists, they say, oh, this is just logical depth."}, {"time": 6048, "text": "I say, it is like logical depth, but it's experimentally measurable."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "They say, oh, it's a bit like Komogolov complexity."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "And so, but it's computable."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable, gets MP hard very quickly, right?"}, {"time": 6062, "text": "It's very hard problem when you could get, but it's a computable enough, you could tractable enough to be able to tell the difference between a molecule that's been formed by the random background and by causation."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And I think that that's really interesting because until now there's no way of measuring complexity objectively."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs and human beings to label things."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "Assembly is label free."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "Well, not entirely."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "We can talk about what that means in a minute."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "Okay, my brain has been broken a couple of times here."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "I'm sorry I explained it really badly."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "No, it was very well explained."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "It was just fascinating."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And it's, my brain is broken into pieces and I'm trying to assemble it."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "So MP hard."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "So when you have a molecule, you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule, which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem, and be hard to figure out the minimum amount of reused components that will create this molecule."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And it becomes difficult when you start to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Cause I'm also like mapping this."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "Can I think about this in complexity generally, like looking at a cellular automata system and saying like, what's the, can this be used as a measure of complexity for like a arbitrarily complicated system?"}, {"time": 6158, "text": "Yeah, I think it can."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And I think that the question is, and what's the benefit?"}, {"time": 6163, "text": "Cause there's plenty of, I mean, in computer science and mathematics and in physics, people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "And I think there's a really interesting problems of where we course grade and we lose information."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "And all assembly theory does really, assembly theory just explains weak emergence."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "And so what assembly theory says, look, going from the atoms that interact, those first replicators that build one another, assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence that there's been replication and selection."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "And I think the more selected something is, the higher the assembly."}, {"time": 6202, "text": "And so we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "If you go to the moon, there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon except the human artifacts we've left there."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "So again, let's go back to the sandbox."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "In assembly theory says, if all the sand grains could stick together, that's the infinite combinatorial explosion in the universe, that should be the default."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "We don't have that."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "Now let's assemble sand grains together and do them in every possible way."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "So we have a series of minimal operations that can move the sand together."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "But all that doesn't exist either."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "Now, because we have specific memory where we say, well, we're gonna put three sand grains in line or four and make a cross or a triangle or something unsymmetrical."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "And once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that, we can use it again, cause on that causal chain."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "So what assembly theory allows you to do is go to the actual object that you exist, you find in space."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "And actually the way you get there is by disassembling."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "It's disassembly theory works by disassembling objects you have and understanding the steps to create them."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "And it works for molecules beautifully cause you just break bonds."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "But like you said, it's very difficult."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "It's a difficult problem to figure out how to break them apart."}, {"time": 6276, "text": "For molecules, it's easy."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "So it's a complete theory."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "When we start to think about objects, we can start to assign, we can start to think about things at different levels, different atoms, what you assign as your atom."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing cause the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part."}, {"time": 6297, "text": "So in a molecule, the atom is the bond cause you break bonds, not atoms, right?"}, {"time": 6302, "text": "So in a car, the atom

the number of identical molecules and then we chop each molecule up in an individual molecule class and calculate the assembly number."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "So basically you then have a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly and then you divide through."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "So you make it divide through by the number of molecules."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "So that's the assembly index for the box?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box."}, {"time": 6418, "text": "So basically the assembly equation we come up with

were to look at me as a box, so say I'm a box, am I assembling my parts?"}, {"time": 6443, "text": "In terms of like, how do you know, what's my assembly index?"}, {"time": 6447, "text": "So I've been gentle."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "So let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "I mean, and look at the number of copies and assembly number."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "So in sand, let's say there's probably gonna be nothing

average it."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "I'm not defined by the most impressive molecules."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "No, no, you're an average in your volume."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "Well, I mean,

written this new programming language for you."}, {"time": 10224, "text": "And so everything is clear."}, {"time": 10226, "text": "And you know, you have to, you're not allowed to just wander around

can make cool robots do chemical reactions."}, {"time": 10246, "text": "And everyone went, that's cool."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "And so in that process."}, {"time": 10251, "text": "The first we

to do a reaction."}, {"time": 10299, "text": "So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction in a flask typically."}, {"time": 10303, "text": "Then you're after the reaction, you have to stop the

10318, "text": "So reaction, workup, separate, purify."}, {"time": 10321, "text": "So this is basically exactly like a Turing machine where you have your tape, you have your tape head, you have some rules, and then you run it."}, {"time": 10330, "text": "So I thought, cool."}, {"time": 10331, "text": "I went to all the chemists and said, look, chemistry isn't that hard."}, {"time": 10335, "text":

with a 3D printer."}, {"time": 10399, "text": "And I said, oh, that's cool, all right."}, {"time": 10400, "text": "So I had them come to the lab and we started to 3D print test tubes."}, {"time": 10404, "text": "So you imagine, you know, 3D print a bottle and then use the same gantry to basically, rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle, have a little syringe and jet chemicals

end."}, {"time": 10424, "text": "Yeah, I was like, that would be cool because they've got G code to do it all."}, {"time": 10427, "text": "And I was like, that's cool."}, {"time": 10428, "text": "So I got my group doing this and I developed it a bit and I realized that we could take those unit operations."}, {"time": 10434, "text": "And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves."}, {"time": 10437,

because you don't understand."}, {"time": 10466, "text": "It's like, yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some?"}, {"time": 10469, "text": "I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand how to, you know, what bus they're gonna use and there's serial ports and all this stuff."}, {"time": 10476, "text": "I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision to design a bunch of pumps and

"All chemistry had been digitized before apparently, and once it's been done, but everyone been doing it in flow and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere and you have to just, and I realized that I could actually make a state machine where I basically put stuff in the reactor, turn it up from one state to another state, stop it and just read it out."}, {"time": 10528, "text":

like, we do all the operation and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again."}, {"time": 10543, "text": "So there's no, so what we managed to do over a couple of years is develop the hardware, develop the state machine."}, {"time": 10550, "text": "And we encoded three molecules."}, {"time": 10552, "text": "We did three, the first three, we did nitole, a sleeping drug, rafinamide,

gonna take our jobs away."}, {"time": 10574, "text": "And not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab, but now we have to become programmers."}, {"time": 10580, "text": "But we're not even

10588, "text": "So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction and I knew that there was language, I could suddenly develop a state machine that would interpret the language, which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction."}, {"time": 10602, "text": "So I built a chemical programming language that is actually gonna be recursively enumerable."}, {"time": 10606, "text": "It's gonna be a Turing complete language actually, which is kind of cool, which means it's formally verifiable."}, {"time": 10611, "text": "So where we are now is we can now read the literature using a bit of

scientific paper that's being read."}, {"time": 10646, "text": "So natural language processing, extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions and the chemical molecules and compounds involved."}, {"time": 10658, "text": "And then that, in GPT terms, serves as a prompt for the program synthesis that's kind of trivial right now."}, {"time": 10669, "text": "There you have a bunch of

a universal chemical reaction system because 3D printing gives the wrong impression, but yeah."}, {"time": 10703, "text": "And it purifies."}, {"time": 10705, "text": "And the nice thing is that that

{"time": 10993, "text": "Right, but the structure, it started out as like an XML type of thing."}, {"time": 11000, "text": "And also, the chemist doesn't need to program in KyDL."}, {"time": 11002, "text": "They can just go to the software and type in add A to B, reflux, do what they would normally do, and it just converts it to KyDL and they have a linter to check it and error correct."},

"We just, XDL?"}, {"time": 11023, "text": "XDL, but all we use, we put in Ky.

such big ideas, cause there's their ideas as well."}, {"time": 11037, "text": "I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronon or anything that, cause they keep saying, you know, is the chemistry, when they're putting stuff in the computer, one of my students said, we're asking now, is it Cronon complete?"}, {"time": 11050, "text": "And I was like, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 11051, "text": "I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?"}, {"time": 11053, "text": "And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a majority?"}, {"time": 11058, "text": "But they're like, well, it might be both."}, {"time": 11061, "text": "Yeah, so you tweeted, quote, why does chemistry need a universal programming language, question mark?"}, {"time": 11069, "text": "For all the reasons you can think of."}, {"time": 11071, "text": "Reliability, interoperability, collaboration, remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety, open up discovery, molecular customization, and publication of executable chemical code."}, {"time": 11086, "text": "Which is fascinating, by the way."}, {"time": 11089, "text": "Just publish code."}, {"time": 11091, "text": "And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more about this CHI DL, what does the universal language of chemistry look like?"}, {"time": 11101, "text": "A Cronon complete language."}, {"time": 11104, "text": "It's a Turing complete language, really."}, {"time": 11107, "text": "But, so what it has, it has a series of operators in it, like add, heat, stir."}, {"time": 11114, "text": "So there's a bunch of unit operations."},

said, well, yeah, I know."}, {"time": 11127, "text": "I said, well, that's trivial."}, {"time": 11130, "text": "I said, well, not really."}, {"time": 11131, "text": "Well, yes, it is trivial, and that's why it's good, because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering, we've made it implementable on the universal hardware that doesn't cost very much money."}, {"time": 11140, "text": "And so the CHI DL has a series of statements."}, {"time": 11143, "text": "Like define the reactor."}, {"time": 11146, "text": "So defines the reagents."}, {"time": 11149, "text": "So they're all labels, so you assign them."}, {"time": 11152, "text": "And what I also implemented at the beginning is, because I give all the hardware IP address, you put it on a graph."}, {"time": 11159, "text": "And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent to the processor firmware, the processor code."}, {"time": 11166, "text": "So when you take your CHI DL, and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any compatible hardware in any configuration, it says, what does your graph look like?"}, {"time": 11174, "text": "As long as I can solve the problem on the graph with these unit

years."}, {"time": 11187, "text": "But it is really, it's chempilation."}, {"time": 11189, "text": "Chempilation, yeah."}, {"time": 11189, "text": "And what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is it was possible to do robotics for chemistry, but the robots were really expensive."}, {"time": 11199, "text": "They were unique."}, {"time": 11200, "text": "They were vendor locked."}, {"time": 11202, "text": "And what I want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world can get access to machinery like this at virtually no cost, because it makes it safer."},

molecule that could potentially cure cancer takes you three years to repeat, and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time and they never get it back."}, {"time": 11227, "text": "So that it's really hard to kind of get all the way to that molecule, and it limits the ability of humanity to build on it."}, {"time": 11236, "text": "If they just download the code and can execute it, it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry is a data cemetery, because no one will ever reproduce it."}, {"time": 11248, "text": "For now, the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook and you can just execute it."}, {"time": 11251, "text": "A notebook and people can play with it, the access to it."}, {"time": 11254, "text": "Reversion it."}, {"time": 11255, "text": "Orders of magnitude is increased."}, {"time": 11257, "text": "We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies, I think there's way more exciting possibilities, but there are also terrifying possibilities, and we'll talk about all of them."}, {"time": 11267, "text": "But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning side of this."}, {"time": 11271, "text": "So you're describing programming, but it's a language, I don't know if you've heard about OpenAI Codex, which is."}, {"time": 11279, "text": "Yeah, I'm playing with it."}, {"time": 11280, "text": "You're playing, of course you are."}, {"time": 11282, "text": "Yeah, you really are Rick from Rick and Morty."}, {"time": 11288, "text": "Okay, except philosophically deep."}, {"time": 11292, "text": "I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too."}, {"time": 11294, "text": "So for people who don't know, GPT, GPT3, that's a language model that can do natural language generation, so you can give it a prompt and it can complete the rest of it."}, {"time": 11306, "text": "But it turns out that that kind of prompt, it's not just completes the rest of it, it's generating like novel sounding text, and then you can apply that to generation of other kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 11320, "text": "So these kinds of transformer based language models are really good at forming deep representations of a particular space, like a medium, like language."}, {"time": 11334, "text": "So you can then apply it to specific subset of language like programming, so you can have it learn the representation of the Python programming language and use it to then generate syntactically and semantically correct programs."}, {"time": 11350, "text": "So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems in computer science, which is program synthesis."}, {"time": 11356, "text": "How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?"}, {"time": 11359, "text": "So what OpenAI Codex does is it to generate those programs based on a prompt of some kind."}, {"time": 11368, "text": "Usually you can do a natural language prompt, so basically as you do when you program, you write some comment which serves the basic documentation of the inputs and the outputs and the function of the particular set of code and it's able to generate that."}, {"time": 11383, "text": "Point being is you can generate programs using machine learning, using neural networks."}, {"time": 11389, "text": "Those programs operate on the boring old computer."}, {"time": 11396, "text": "Can you generate programs that operate, this gotta be a clever version of programs for this, but can you write programs that operate on a computer?"}, {"time": 11406, "text": "Yep, there's actually software out there right now you can go and do it."}, {"time": 11411, "text": "Yeah, yeah, it's a heuristic, it's rule based, but we have, what we've done, inspired by Codex actually, is over the summer I ran a little workshop."}, {"time": 11423, "text": "Some of my groups got this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and ask them to manually collect data, to label chemical procedures into Kydy L.

have an abstraction that's implementable in the hardware, we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex."}, {"time": 11454, "text": "When you say, sorry to interrupt, when you say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 11459, "text": "So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning and reading chemistry and saying, oh, you've got all these operations, add, shake, whatever, heat."}, {"time": 11467, "text": "But because they don't have a uniform, I mean, it's a couple of groups doing it, competitors actually, and they're good, very good."}, {"time": 11475, "text": "But they can't run that code automatically."}, {"time": 11480, "text": "They are losing meaning."}, {"time": 11484, "text": "And the really important thing that you have to do is generate context."}, {"time": 11489, "text": "And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction is make sure we can pull the context out of the text."}, {"time": 11496, "text": "And so can we take a chemical procedure and read it and generate our executable code?"}, {"time": 11503, "text": "What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline from the initial text, interpreting the initial text of a paper, extracting the meaningful context and the meaningful chemical information to then generating the program to then running that program in the hardware?"}, {"time": 11520, "text": "What's the hardest part about that pipeline as we look towards a universal Turing computer?"}, {"time": 11525, "text": "So the hardest thing with the pipeline is that the software, the model gets confused between some meanings, right?"}, {"time": 11538, "text": "So if, you know, chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken down."}, {"time": 11542, "text": "So I would, the classic word that you would use for boiling something is called reflux."}, {"time": 11548, "text": "So reflux is, you would have a solvent in a round bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling, going up the reflux condenser and coming down."}, {"time": 11555, "text": "But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know, to people often make up words, new words, and then the software can fall over."}, {"time": 11567, "text": "But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python or any programming language is identify when things aren't matched."}, {"time": 11575, "text": "So you present the code and you say, this isn't matched."}, {"time": 11577, "text": "You may want to think about this."}, {"time": 11578, "text": "And then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux and just ticks a box and collects it."}, {"time": 11582, "text": "So what the Codex or the Chemex does in this case is it just, it suggests the first go and then the chemist goes in and corrects it."}, {"time": 11594, "text": "And I really want the chemist to correct it because it's not safe, I believe, for it to allow AI to just read literature and generate code at this stage."}, {"time": 11605, "text": "Because now you're having actual, by the way, Chemex, nice, nice name, so you are unlike, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 11618, "text": "It's that we live in a fascinating moment in human history."}, {"time": 11622, "text": "But yes, you're literally connecting AI to some physical and like it's building something in the physical realm, especially in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly."}, {"time": 11642, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I would say that's right."}, {"time": 11645, "text": "And it's really important to understand those labeling schemes, right?"}, {"time": 11649, "text": "And one of the things I was never, I was always worried about the beginning that the abstraction was gonna fall over."}, {"time": 11655, "text": "And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with."}, {"time": 11658, "text": "We just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new?"}, {"time": 11660, "text": "Can we add a new rule in?"}, {"time": 11661, "text": "And actually our KyDL language expanded, exploded."}, {"time": 11665, "text": "There was so many extra things we had to keep adding."}, {"time": 11668, "text": "And then I realized the primitives still were maintained and I could break them down again."}, {"time": 11672, "text": "So it's pretty good."}, {"time": 11675, "text": "I mean, there are problems."}, {"time": 11676, "text": "There are problems of interpreting any big sentence and turning it into an actionable code."}, {"time": 11680, "text": "And in Codex, it's not without its problems."}, {"time": 11682, "text": "You can crash it quite easily, right?"}, {"time": 11684, "text": "You can generate nonsense."}, {"time": 11685, "text": "But boy, it's interesting."}, {"time": 11687, "text": "I would love to learn to program now using Codex, right?"}, {"time": 11692, "text": "Just hacking around, right?"}, {"time": 11694, "text": "And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn to do chemistry by just hacking around with the system and writing different things."}, {"time": 11702, "text": "Because the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica, he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A or molecule A reacts with molecule B to give molecule C. That's not what chemistry is."}, {"time": 11720, "text": "Chemistry is take some molecule, take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it and then extract it."}, {"time": 11729, "text": "So the programming language is actually with respect to the process operations."}, {"time": 11735, "text": "And if you flick in process space, not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything because there's only a finite number of processes you need to do in chemistry."}, {"time": 11745, "text": "And that's reassuring."}, {"time": 11747, "text": "And so we're in the middle of it, it's really exciting."}, {"time": 11751, "text": "It's not the be all and the end all."}, {"time": 11753, "text": "And there is like I say, errors that can creep in."}, {"time": 11755, "text": "One day we might be able to do it without human interaction and you simulate it."}, {"time": 11759, "text": "And you'll know enough about the simulation that the lab won't catch fire."}, {"time": 11765, "text": "But there are so many safety issues right now that we've got to really be very careful, protecting the user, protecting the environment, protecting misuse."}, {"time": 11773, "text": "I mean, there's lots to discuss if you want to go down that route because it's very, very interesting."}, {"time": 11777, "text": "You don't want Novichoks being made or explosives being made or recreational drugs being made."}, {"time": 11786, "text": "But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug that's gonna be important for them looking at their particular assay on a bad actor trying to make

you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen, that will happen, that there's no stopping it."}, {"time": 11838, "text": "And I, as we've been talking about, I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities."}, {"time": 11844, "text": "So whenever you automate these kinds of things, just the world opens up."}, {"time": 11851, "text": "It's like programming itself and the computer, regular computer, has created innumerable applications."}, {"time": 11859, "text": "It made the world better in so many dimensions."}, {"time": 11863, "text": "And it created, of course, a lot of negative things that we, for some reason, like to focus on using that very technology to tweet about it."}, {"time": 11872, "text": "But I think it made a much better world, but it created a lot of new dangers."}, {"time": 11877, "text": "So maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of stand at the end of the road for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer."},

chance of the negative?"}, {"time": 11902, "text": "So there's so many positive things, from drug discovery, from supply chain stress, for basically enabling chemists to basically build more

better for science."}, {"time": 11924, "text": "So they can build a bunch of, like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace."}, {"time": 11930, "text": "So it's not just the development

negative."}, {"time": 12016, "text": "Before we do that, let's imagine what happened, go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago, well not accident, an act of murder by that pilot on the, I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings."}, {"time": 12028, "text": "But what he did is plane took off, he waited till his pilot went to the toilet, he was a co pilot, he locked the door and then set the

by this and my thinking, what can I do to anticipate problems like this in the computer?"}, {"time": 12065, "text": "Had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer a bit more situational awareness."}, {"time": 12072, "text": "So whenever one tries to drop the height of the plane and it knows it's above the Alps, we'll just say, oh no, computer

and easier."}, {"time": 12111, "text": "But what we're gonna start to do, it makes sense to encrypt the Kydeals in such a way, let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company and you have a license to make given molecule, well, you get issued with a license by the FDA or your local authority and they'll say, right, your license to do it, here it is, it's encrypted and the Kydeal gets run."},

way we have a many, it's like the same mapping problem that you, to actually reverse engineer a Kydeal will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key, brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine."}, {"time": 12164, "text": "And actually people aren't gonna want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals because it'll be so cheap to do it."}, {"time":

chance that it can get into like the hands of individuals like terrorists or people that want to do harm."}, {"time": 12212, "text": "Now with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments, in the hands of institutions."}, {"time": 12220, "text": "And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you might have of governments that can sometimes use these for ill, use

blockchain, but there is a way of maybe taking Kydeals and put them in blockchain."}, {"time": 12256, "text": "Here's an idea, let's just say, the way we're doing it in my lab right now is we go to the literature, we take a recipe to make a molecule, convert that to Kydeal and diligently make it in the robot and validate it."}, {"time": 12268, "text": "We, that, so we, I would call mining proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?"}, {"time": 12274, "text": "Proof of the synthesis."}, {"time": 12275, "text": "Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly when you actually synthesize it, you

{"time": 911, "text": "So I think games at the time had the most cutting edge AI."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And a lot of the games, I was involved in writing."}, {"time": 919, "text": "So there was a game called Black and White, which was one game I was involved with in the early stages of, which I still think is the most impressive example of reinforcement learning in a computer game."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So in that game, you trained a little pet animal and..."}, {"time": 934, "text": "It's a brilliant game."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And it sort of learned from how you were treating it."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So if you treated it badly, then it became mean."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And then it would be mean to your villagers and your population, the sort of the little tribe that you were running."}, {"time": 947, "text": "But if you were kind to it, then it would be kind."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And people were fascinated by how that works."}, {"time": 951, "text": "And so was I to be honest with the way it kind of developed."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Especially the mapping to good and evil."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Made you realize, made me realize that you can sort of in the choices you make can define where you end up."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And that means all of us are capable of the good, evil."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It all matters in the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make."}, {"time": 979, "text": "I mean, games can do that philosophically to you."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And it's rare."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It seems rare."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Well, games are, I think, a unique medium because you as the player, you're not just passively consuming the entertainment, right?"}, {"time": 990, "text": "You're actually actively involved as an agent."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So I think that's what makes it in some ways can be more visceral than other mediums like films and books."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So the second, so that was designing AI in games."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And then the third use we've used of AI is in DeepMind from the beginning, which is using games as a testing ground for proving out AI algorithms and developing AI algorithms."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And that was a sort of a core component of our vision at the start of DeepMind was that we would use games very heavily as our main testing ground, certainly to begin with, because it's super efficient to use games."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And also, it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand, there's already a strong set of rules."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Like it's already a damn good benchmark."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yes, it's really good for so many reasons because you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And in some cases like Go, we've been playing it for thousands of years and often they have scores or at least win conditions."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's very easy to specify what that reward is."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And also at the end, it's easy to test externally at how strong is your system by of course, playing against the world's strongest players at those games."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "So it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run potentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So I think there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in starting out 2010, how come we were able to progress so quickly because we've utilized games."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And at the beginning of DeepMind, we also hired some amazing game engineers who I knew from my previous lives in the games industry."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And that helped to bootstrap us very quickly."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine over a chess board or a Go board."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And especially given that the entire history of AI is defined by people saying it's gonna be impossible to make a machine that beats a human being in chess."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then once that happened, people were certain when I was coming up in AI that Go is not a game that can be solved because of the combinatorial complexity is just too, it's no matter how much Moore's law you have, compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of Go."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And so then there's something compelling about facing, sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the AI researcher perspective, engineer perspective, and then as a human being, just observing this whole thing."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Your beliefs about what you thought was impossible being broken apart, it's humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "It's humbling to realize that the things we think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "There's something really powerful about a game, AI system beating human being in a game that drives that message home for like millions, billions of people, especially in the case of Go."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Well, look, I think it's, I mean, it has been a fascinating journey and especially as I think about it from, I can understand it from both sides, both as the AI, creators of the AI, but also as a games player originally."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So, it was a really interesting, I mean, it was a fantastic, but also somewhat bittersweet moment, the AlphaGo match for me, seeing that and being obviously heavily involved in that."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "But as you say, chess has been the, I mean, Kasparov, I think rightly called it the Drosophila of intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So, it's sort of, I love that phrase and I think he's right because chess has been hand in hand with AI from the beginning of the whole field, right?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So, I think every AI practitioner, starting with Turing and Claude Shannon and all those, the sort of forefathers of the field, tried their hand at writing a chess program."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I've got original edition of Claude Shannon's first chess program, I think it was 1949, the original sort of paper."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And they all did that and Turing famously wrote a chess program, but all the computers around them were obviously too slow to run it."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So, he had to run, he had to be the computer, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So, he literally, I think spent two or three days running his own program by hand with pencil and paper and playing a friend of his with his chess program."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So, of course, Deep Blue was a huge moment, beating Kasparov, but actually when that happened, I remember that very vividly, of course, because it was chess and computers and AI, all the things I loved and I was at college at the time."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "But I remember coming away from that, being more impressed by Kasparov's mind than I was by Deep Blue."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Because here was Kasparov with his human mind, not only could he play chess more or less to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine, but of course, Kasparov can do everything else humans can do, ride a bike, talk many languages, do politics, all the rest of the amazing things that Kasparov does."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And so, with the same brain."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And yet Deep Blue, brilliant as it was at chess, it'd been hand coded for chess and actually had distilled the knowledge of chess grandmasters into a cool program, but it couldn't do anything else."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "It couldn't even play a strictly simpler game like tic tac toe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So, something to me was missing from intelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I think it was this idea of generality and also learning."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So, and that's obviously what we tried to do with AlphaGo."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Yeah, with AlphaGo and AlphaZero, MuZero, and then God and all the things that we'll get into some parts of, there's just a fascinating trajectory here."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But let's just stick on chess briefly."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "On the human side of chess, you've proposed that from a game design perspective, the thing that makes chess compelling as a game is that there's a creative tension between a bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Can you explain this?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "First of all, it's really interesting to think about what makes a game compelling, makes it stick across centuries."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Yeah, I was sort of thinking about this, and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a game's designer point of view."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "So, it's with my game design hat on that I was thinking about this, why is chess so compelling?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And I think a critical reason is the dynamicness of the different kind of chess positions you can have, whether they're closed or open and other things, comes from the bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "So, if you think about how different the capabilities of the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move, and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two capabilities more or less equally."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "So, they're both roughly worth three points each."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So, you think that dynamics is always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Well, maybe, I mean, it's sort of, I don't know, it's chicken and egg situation, probably both came together."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop and knight that are so different in power, but so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions, right?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years, I think gives the game the creative tension that you can swap the bishop and knights for a bishop for a knight, and they're more or less worth the same, but now you aim for a different type of position."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "If you have the knight, you want a closed position."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "If you have the bishop, you want an open position."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So, I think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So, some kind of controlled creative tension."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "From an AI perspective, do you think AI systems could eventually design games that are optimally compelling to humans?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Sometimes I get asked about AI and creativity, and the way I answered that is relevant to that question, which is that I think there are different levels of creativity, one could say."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So, I think if we define creativity as coming up with something original, right, that's useful for a purpose, then I think the kind of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "So, an averaging of all the examples you see."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So, maybe a very basic AI system could say you could have that."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So, you show it millions of pictures of cats, and then you say, give me an average looking cat, right?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Generate me an average looking cat."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I would call that interpolation."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Then there's extrapolation, which something like AlphaGo showed."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So, AlphaGo played millions of games of Go against itself, and then it came up with brilliant new ideas like Move 37 in game two, brilliant motif strategies in Go that no humans had ever thought of, even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So, that I call that extrapolation, but then there's still a level above that, which is, you could call out of the box thinking or true innovation, which is, could you invent Go, right?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move or brilliant Go move, but can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or Go?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And I think one day AI could, but then what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a program right now?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And the way I would do it if I was telling a human to do it or a human games designer to do it is I would say, something like Go, I would say, come up with a game that only takes five minutes to learn, which Go does because it's got simple rules, but many lifetimes to master, right?"}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Or impossible to master in one lifetime because it's so deep and so complex."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And then it's aesthetically beautiful."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And also it can be completed in three or four hours of gameplay time, which is useful for us in a human day."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And so you might specify these sort of high level concepts like that, and then with that and then maybe a few other things, one could imagine that Go satisfies those constraints."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But the problem is that we're not able to specify abstract notions like that, high level abstract notions like that yet to our AI systems."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And I think there's still something missing there in terms of high level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and they're combinable and compositional."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So for the moment, I think AI is capable of doing interpolation and extrapolation, but not true invention."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So coming up with rule sets and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets, we can't currently do."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "But you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self play experiment to see how long, just observe how an AI system from scratch learns, how long is that journey of learning?"}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on, and you could see a long journey to master for even an AI system, then you could say that this is a promising game."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "But it would be nice to do almost like AlphaCode so programming rules."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So generating rules that automate even that part of the generation of rules."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So I have thought about systems actually that I think would be amazing for a games designer."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "If you could have a system that takes your game, plays it tens of millions of times, maybe overnight, and then self balances the rules better."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So it tweaks the rules and maybe the equations and the parameters so that the game is more balanced, the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So it's a bit of like giving a base set and then allowing Monte Carlo Tree Search or something like that to sort of explore it."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And I think that would be super powerful tool actually for balancing, auto balancing a game, which usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of human games testers normally to balance a game like StarCraft, which is Blizzard are amazing at balancing their games, but it takes them years and years and years."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So one could imagine at some point when this stuff becomes efficient enough to you might be able to do that like overnight."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Do you think a game that is optimal designed by an AI system would look very much like a planet earth?"}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Maybe, maybe it's only the sort of game I would love to make is, and I've tried in my games career, the games design career, my first big game was designing a theme park, an amusement park."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Then with games like Republic, I tried to have games where we designed whole cities and allowed you to play in."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So, and of course people like Will Wright have written games like SimEarth, trying to simulate the whole of earth, pretty tricky, but I think."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "SimEarth, I haven't actually played that one."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Does it incorporate of evolution or?"}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Yeah, it has evolution and it sort of tries to, it sort of treats it as an entire biosphere, but from quite high level."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "It'd be nice to be able to sort of zoom in, zoom out and zoom in."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "So obviously it couldn't do, that was in the 90s."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "I think he wrote that in the 90s."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "So it couldn't, it wasn't able to do that, but that would be obviously the ultimate sandbox game."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "On that topic, do you think we're living in a simulation?"}, {"time": 1804, "text": "Yes, well, so, okay."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So I."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "We're gonna jump around from the absurdly philosophical to the technical."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Sure, sure, very, very happy to."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So I think my answer to that question is a little bit complex because there is simulation theory, which obviously Nick Bostrom, I think famously first proposed."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And I don't quite believe it in that sense."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "So in the sense that are we in some sort of computer game or have our descendants somehow recreated earth in the 21st century and some, for some kind of experimental reason."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "I think that, but I do think that we, that we might be, that the best way to understand physics and the universe is from a computational perspective."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So understanding it as an information universe and actually information being the most fundamental unit of reality rather than matter or energy."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "So a physicist would say, you know, matter or energy, you know, E equals MC squared."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "These are the things that are the fundamentals of the universe."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "I'd actually say information, which of course itself can be, can specify energy or matter, right?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Matter is actually just, you know, we're just out the way our bodies and the molecules in our body are arranged as information."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "So I think information may be the most fundamental way to describe the universe."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And therefore you could say we're in some sort of simulation because of that."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "But I don't, I do, I'm not, I'm not really a subscriber to the idea that, you know, these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "I think this is actually very critical and possibly unique, this simulation."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "This particular one."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And you just mean treating the universe as a computer that's processing and modifying information is a good way to solve the problems of physics, of chemistry, of biology, and perhaps of humanity and so on."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Yes, I think understanding physics in terms of information theory might be the best way to really understand what's going on here."}, {"time":

computation."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "Do you think all of it, the whole shebangs, can be a computation?"}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Yeah, I've had many fascinating debates with Sir Roger Penrose, and obviously he's famously, and I read, you know, Emperors of the New Mind and his books, his classical books, and they were pretty influential in the 90s."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And he believes that there's something more, something quantum that is needed to explain consciousness in the brain."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "I think about what we're doing actually at DeepMind and what my career is being, we're almost like Turing's champion."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So we are pushing Turing machines or classical computation to the limits."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "What are the limits of what classical computing can do?"}, {"time": 1989, "text": "Now, and at the same time, I've also studied neuroscience to see, and that's why I did my PhD in, was to see, also to look at, you know, is there anything quantum in the brain from a neuroscience or biological perspective?"}, {"time": 2001, "text": "And so far, I think most neuroscientists and most mainstream biologists and neuroscientists would say there's no evidence of any quantum systems or effects in the brain."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "As far as we can see, it can be mostly explained by classical theories."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So, and then, so there's sort of the search from the biology side."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "And then at the same time, there's the raising of the water, the bar, from what classical Turing machines can do."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "And, you know, including our new AI systems."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And as you alluded to earlier, you know, I think AI, especially in the last decade plus, has been a continual story now of surprising events and surprising successes, knocking over one theory after another of what was thought to be impossible, you know, from Go to protein folding

DeepMind has been working with."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "Well, look, I think it's, you say it's a few, you know, of course it's, this is the, I think the biggest miracle of the universe is that it is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And yet it's also our brains are the most complex objects that we know of in the universe."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "So there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "And I think that it's an incredibly, incredible efficient machine."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "And it's, you know, phenomenon basically."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "We've wondered about them since the dawn of humanity."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And I think one of the reasons, and, you know, I love philosophy and philosophy of mind is, we found it difficult is there haven't been the tools for us to really, other than introspection, from very clever people in history, very clever philosophers, to really investigate this scientifically."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "But now suddenly we have a plethora of tools."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "Firstly, we have all of the neuroscience tools, fMRI machines, single cell recording, all of this stuff, but we also have the ability, computers and AI, to build intelligent systems."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "So I think that, you know, I think it is amazing what the human mind does."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "And I'm kind of in awe of it really."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And I think it's amazing that with our human minds, we're able to build things like

building blocks of biology that I think is another angle at which you can start to understand the human mind, the human body, which is quite fascinating, which is from the basic building blocks, start to simulate, start to model how from those building blocks, you can construct bigger and bigger, more complex systems, maybe one day the entirety of the human biology."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So here's another problem that thought to be impossible to solve, which is protein folding."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "And Alpha Fold or specifically Alpha Fold 2 did just that."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "It solved protein folding."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "I think it's one of the biggest breakthroughs, certainly in the history of structural biology, but in general in science, maybe from a high level, what is it and how does it work?"}, {"time": 2284, "text": "And then we can ask some fascinating questions after."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So maybe to explain it to people not familiar with

string of beads and then they fold up into a ball."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "Now, the key thing is you want to know what that 3D structure is because the structure, the 3D structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it do, the function it does in your body."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also if you're interested in drugs or disease, you need to understand that 3D structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound about to block something the protein's doing, you need to understand where it's gonna bind on the surface of the protein."}, {"time": 2363,

mapped to the function and the structure is obviously somehow specified by the amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And that's the, in essence, the protein folding problem is, can you just from the amino acid sequence, the one dimensional string of letters, can you immediately computationally predict the 3D structure?"}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And this has been a grand challenge in biology for over 50 years."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So I think it was first articulated by Christian Anfinsen, a Nobel prize winner in 1972, as part of his Nobel prize winning lecture."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And he just speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3D structure, but he didn't say how."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "So it's been described to me as equivalent to Fermat's last theorem, but for biology."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "You should, as somebody that very well might win the Nobel prize in the future."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "But outside of that, you should do more of that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "In the margin, just put random things that will take like 200 years to solve."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "Set people off for 200 years."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "It should be possible."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And just don't give any details."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "I think everyone exactly should be, I'll have to remember that for future."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "So yeah, so he set off, you know, with this one throwaway remark, just like Fermat, you know, he set off this whole 50 year field really of computational biology."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And they had, you know, they got stuck."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "They hadn't really got very far with doing this."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And until now, until AlphaFold came along, this is done experimentally, right?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "Very painstakingly."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So the rule of thumb is, and you have to like crystallize the protein, which is really difficult."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "And then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or X ray crystallography machines."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Really painstaking work to get the 3D structure and visualize the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So the rule of thumb in experimental biology is that it takes one PhD student, their entire PhD to do one protein."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And with AlphaFold 2, we were able to predict the 3D structure in a matter of seconds."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And so we were, you know, over Christmas, we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human body or 20,000 proteins."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So the human proteomes like the equivalent of the human genome, but on protein space."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And sort of revolutionized really what a structural biologist can do."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Because now they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimental, should they put all of that effort in or not?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "They can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a Google search."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "And so there's a data set on which it's trained and how to map this amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "First of all, it's incredible that a protein, this little chemical computer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "That's a weird thing."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "And they evolve that way because, you know, in the beginning, I mean, that's a great invention, just the protein itself."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And then there's, I think, probably a history of like they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to form high level functions."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I mean, it's a weird system that they figured it out."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too, but proteins themselves, I think are magical and incredible, as I said, little bio nano machines."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And actually Leventhal, who was another scientist, a contemporary of Amphinson, he coined this Leventhal, what became known as Leventhal's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "He calculated roughly an average protein, which is maybe 2000 amino acids base as long, is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different confirmations."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "So there's 10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "And yet somehow in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of milliseconds."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in fractions of a second."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So physics is somehow solving that search problem."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And just to be clear, in many of these cases, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "So among that huge number of possibilities, it figures out a way how to stably, in some cases there might be a misfunction, so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "But most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Which is what the problem is."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "Exactly, so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy, if it's healthy, and as you say in disease, so for example, Alzheimer's, one conjecture is that it's because of misfolded protein, a protein that folds in the wrong way, amyloid beta protein."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So, and then because it folds in the wrong way, it gets tangled up, right, in your neurons."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also disease is to understand, you know, what these things are doing and how they're structuring."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Of course, the next step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "So they're not just static necessarily in biology."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "Maybe you can give some interesting, so beautiful things to you about these early days of AlphaFold, of solving this problem, because unlike games, this is real physical systems that are less amenable to self play type of mechanisms."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "The size of the data set is smaller than you might otherwise like, so you have to be very clever about certain things."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "Is there something you could speak to what was very hard to solve and what are some beautiful aspects about the solution?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Yeah, I would say AlphaFold is the most complex and also probably most meaningful system we've built so far."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So it's been an amazing time actually in the last, you know, two, three years to see that come through because as we talked about earlier, you know, games is what we started on building things like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, but really the ultimate goal was to, not just to crack games, it was just to build, use them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Specifically, my passion is scientific challenges like protein folding."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "And then AlphaFold of course is our first big proof point of that."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And so, you know, in terms of the data and the amount of innovations that had to go into it, we, you know, it was like more than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "I think some of the big innovations were that kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and evolutionary biology to constrain sort of things like the bond angles in the protein and things like that, a lot, but not to impact the learning system."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "So still allowing the system to be able to learn the physics itself from the examples that we had."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And the examples, as you say, there are only about 150,000 proteins, even after 40 years of experimental biology, only around 150,000 proteins have been, the structures have been found out about."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So that was our training set, which is much less than normally we would like to use, but using various tricks, things like self distillation."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "So actually using AlphaFold predictions, some of the best predictions that it thought was highly confident in, we put them back into the training set, right?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "To make the training set bigger, that was critical to AlphaFold working."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So there was actually a huge number of different innovations like that, that were required to ultimately crack the problem."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "AlphaFold one, what it produced was a distrogram."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances between all of the molecules in the protein."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And then there had to be a separate optimization process to create the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "And what we did for AlphaFold two is make it truly end to end."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So we went straight from the amino acid sequence of bases to the 3D structure directly without going through this intermediate step."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And in machine learning, what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make it, the better the system."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And it's probably because in the end, the system's better at learning what the constraints are than we are as the human designers of specifying it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for, in this case, the 3D structure, you're better off than having this intermediate step, which you then have to handcraft the next step for."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system from the end point, the end output you want to the inputs."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So that's a good way to start on a new problem."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "Handcraft a bunch of stuff, add a bunch of manual constraints with a small end to end learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece until it consumes the whole thing."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "And so you can also see, this is a bit of a method we've developed over doing many sort of successful alpha, we call them alpha X projects, right?"}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alpha go to alpha zero."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So alpha go was a learning system, but it was specifically trained to only play go, right?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and what we wanted to do with first version of alpha go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it, right?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And then of course, alpha go zero, we remove the need to use human games as a starting point, right?"}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So that removed the need for human knowledge about go."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And then finally alpha zero then generalized it so that any things we had in there, the system, including things like symmetry of the go board were removed."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu zero, which is the final, our latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It would learn that for itself."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "So it could also deal with computer games as well as board games."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "So that line of alpha go, alpha go zero, alpha zero, mu zero, that's the full trajectory of what you can take from imitation learning to full self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And learning the entire structure of the environment you're put in from scratch, right?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And bootstrapping it through self play yourself."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "But the thing is it would have been impossible, I think, or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu zero first out of the box."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "Even psychologically, because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "You're constantly dealing with doubt because a lot of people say that it's impossible."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Exactly, so it's hard enough just to do go."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "As you were saying, everyone thought that was impossible or at least a decade away from when we did it back in 2015, 2016."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And so yes, it would have been psychologically probably very difficult as well as the fact that of course we learn a lot by building alpha go first."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Right, so I think this is why I call AI an engineering science."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "It's one of the most fascinating science disciplines, but it's also an engineering science in the sense that unlike natural sciences, the phenomenon you're studying doesn't exist out in nature."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "You have to build it first."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So you have to build the artifact first, and then you can study and pull it apart and how it works."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "This is tough to ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything, but let's try to think through this because you're in a very interesting position where DeepMind is a place of some of the most brilliant ideas in the history of AI, but it's also a place of brilliant engineering."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "So how much of solving intelligence, this big goal for DeepMind, how much of it is science?"}, {"time": 3072, "text": "How much is engineering?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "So how much is the algorithms?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "How much is the data?"}, {"time": 3076, "text": "How much is the hardware compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "How much is it the software compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "How much is the human infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And like just the humans interacting certain kinds of ways in all the space of all those ideas."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And how much is maybe like philosophy?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "How much, what's the key?"}, {"time": 3095, "text": "If you were to sort of look back, like if we go forward 200 years and look back, what was the key thing that solved intelligence?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Is it the ideas or the engineering?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "I think it's a combination."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "First of all, of course, it's a combination of all those things, but the ratios of them changed over time."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "So even in the last 12 years, so we started DeepMind in 2010, which is hard to imagine now because 2010, it's only 12 short years ago, but nobody was talking about AI."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "I don't know if you remember back to your MIT days, no one was talking about it."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I did a postdoc at MIT back around then."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And it was sort of thought of as a, well, look, we know AI doesn't work."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "We tried this hard in the 90s at places like MIT, mostly using logic systems and old fashioned, sort of good old fashioned AI, we would call it now."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "People like Minsky and Patrick Winston, and you know all these characters, right?"}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And used to debate a few of them."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And they used to think I was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with learning systems."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "And I was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at that point, right?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Even if all of your professors are telling you you're mad."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And of course in industry, we couldn't get, it was difficult to get two cents together, which is hard to imagine now as well, given that it's the biggest sort of buzzword in VCs and fundraisings easy and all these kinds of things today."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "So back in 2010, it was very difficult."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "And the reason we started then, and Shane and I used to discuss what were the sort of founding tenants of DeepMind."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "And it was various things."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "One was algorithmic advances."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So deep learning, you know, Jeff Hinton and Co had just sort of invented that in academia, but no one in industry knew about it."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "We love reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "We thought that could be scaled up."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "But also understanding about the human brain had advanced quite a lot in the decade prior with fMRI machines and other things."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and sort of representations maybe that the brain uses."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So at a systems level, not at a implementation level."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And then the other big things were compute and GPUs, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So we could see a compute was going to be really useful and had got to a place where it become commoditized mostly through the games industry and that could be taken advantage of."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "So things like AIXI, AIXE, which Shane worked on with his supervisor, Marcus Hutter, which is this sort of theoretical proof really of universal intelligence, which is actually a reinforcement learning system in the limit."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I mean, it assumes infinite compute and infinite memory in the way, you know, like a Turing machine proves."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "But I was also waiting to see something like that too, to, you know, like Turing machines and computation theory that people like Turing and Shannon came up with underpins modern computer science."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "You know, I was waiting for a theory like that to sort of underpin AGI research."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "So when I, you know, met Shane and saw he was working on something like that, you know, that to me was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So in the early days, I would say that ideas were the most important."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "You know, for us, it was deep reinforcement learning, scaling up deep learning."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "Of course, we've seen transformers."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "So huge leaps, I would say, you know, three or four from, if you think from 2010 till now, huge evolutions, things like AlphaGo."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "And maybe there's a few more still needed."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "But as we get closer to AI, AGI, I think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the recent, you know, results of GPT3 and all the big language models and large models, including our ones, has shown that scale and large models are clearly gonna be a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient part of an AGI solution."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And throughout that, like you said, and I'd like to give you a big thank you."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "You're one of the pioneers in this is sticking by ideas like reinforcement learning, that this can actually work given actually limited success in the past."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And also, which we still don't know, but proudly having the best researchers in the world and talking about solving intelligence."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So talking about whatever you call it, AGI or something like this, speaking of MIT, that's just something you wouldn't bring up."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Not maybe you did in like 40, 50 years ago, but that was, AI was a place where you do tinkering, very small scale, not very ambitious projects."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And maybe the biggest ambitious projects were in the space of robotics and doing like the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "But the task of solving intelligence and believing you can, that's really, really powerful."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "So in order for engineering to do its work, to have great engineers, build great systems, you have to have that belief, that threads throughout the whole thing that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "And back in 2010, our mission statement and still is today, it was used to be solving step one, solve intelligence, step two, use it to solve everything else."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "So if you can imagine pitching that to a VC in 2010, the kind of looks we got, we managed to find a few kooky people to back us, but it was tricky."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "And it got to the point where we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we committed career suicide."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "And so it was, there's a lot of things that we had to do, but we always believed it."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "And one reason, by the way, one reason I've always believed in reinforcement learning is that if you look at neuroscience, that is the way that the primate brain learns."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "One of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system implements some form of TD learning."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "It was a very famous result in the late 90s where they saw this in monkeys and as a propagating prediction error."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So again, in the limit, this is what I think you can use neuroscience for is, at mathematics, when you're doing something as ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and it's blue sky research, no one knows how to do it, you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "So that was one reason we pushed so hard on that."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "And just going back to your earlier question about organization, the other big thing that I think we innovated with at DeepMind to encourage invention and innovation was the multidisciplinary organization we built and we still have today."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So DeepMind originally was a confluence of the most cutting edge knowledge in neuroscience with machine learning, engineering and mathematics, right?"}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And gaming."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And then since then we've built that out even further."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "So we have philosophers here and ethicists, but also other types of scientists, physicists and so on."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And that's what brings together, I tried to build a sort of new type of Bell Labs, but in its golden era, right?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "And a new expression of that to try and foster this incredible sort of innovation machine."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So talking about the humans in the machine, DeepMind itself is a learning machine with lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these learning systems."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "If we return to the big ambitious dream of AlphaFold, that may be the early steps on a very long journey in biology, do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological systems?"}, {"time": 3558, "text": "So multi protein interaction, and then, I mean, you can go out from there, just simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body, just the big mush, the mess of the beautiful, resilient mess of biology."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "Do you see that as a long term vision?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "I do, and I think, if you think about what are the top things I wanted to apply AI to once we had powerful enough systems, biology and curing diseases and understanding biology was right up there, top of my list."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "That's one of the reasons I personally pushed that myself and with AlphaFold, but I think AlphaFold, amazing as it is, is just the beginning."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And I hope it's evidence of what could be done with computational methods."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "So AlphaFold solved this huge problem of the structure of proteins, but biology is dynamic."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So really what I imagine from here, and we're working on all these things now, is protein, protein interaction, protein ligand binding, so reacting with molecules, then you wanna build up to pathways, and then eventually a virtual cell."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "That's my dream, maybe in the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And I've been talking actually to a lot of biologists, friends of mine, Paul Nurse, who runs the Crick Institute, amazing biologists, Nobel Prize winning biologists."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "We've been discussing for 20 years now, virtual cells."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Could you build a virtual simulation of a cell?"}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And if you could, that would be incredible for biology and disease discovery, because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell, and then only at the last stage, validate it in the wet lab."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So you could, in terms of the search space of discovering new drugs, it takes 10 years roughly to go from identifying a target, to having a drug candidate."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "Maybe that could be shortened by an order of magnitude, if you could do most of that work in silico."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So in order to get to a virtual cell, we have to build up understanding of different parts of biology and the interactions."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "And so every few years we talk about this, I talked about this with Paul."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "And then finally, last year after AlphaFold, I said, now's the time we can finally go for it."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And AlphaFold is the first proof point that this might be possible."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And he's very excited, and we have some collaborations with his lab, they're just across the road actually from us, it's wonderful being here in King's Cross with the Crick Institute across the road."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And I think the next steps, I think there's gonna be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like AlphaFold."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "We're already seeing that with

the rules."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "It's too emergent, too dynamic, say compared to a physics system, like the motion of a planet, right?"}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so you have to learn the

amazing human ingenuity that's behind these systems."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And then the system, in my opinion, is just a tool."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "Be a bit like saying with Galileo and his

see that in the same way today, even though these tools learn for themselves."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "There, I think of things like alpha fold and the things we're building as the ultimate tools for science and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists acquire new knowledge."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "I think one day there will come a point where an AI system may solve or come up

the blue rather than being specified by the human scientists or the human creators."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "So I think right now it's definitely just a tool."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Although it

4226, "text": "And one can even think of DeepMind, as I said earlier, as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and AI engineering ideas originally."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "And so I think there's that."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "And then one of the things we can't imagine today is, and one of the reasons I think people, we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that actually it's very hard for our human minds, our limited human minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole internet, right?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "I think we can do a thought

comprehend maybe what that would be like, but the whole internet is beyond comprehension."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "So I think we just don't understand what it would be like to be able to hold all of that in mind potentially, right?"}, {"time": 4270, "text": "And then active at once, and then maybe what are the connections that are available there?"}, {"time": 4275, "text": "So I think no doubt there are huge things to be discovered just like that."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "But I do think there is this other type of creativity of true spark of new knowledge, new idea, never thought before

things together."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "I think some of the greatest scientists in history have displayed that I would say, although it's very hard to know going back to their time, what was

perspective, from our point of view, from an AI point of view, and that would address one of their bottlenecks."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "And in this case, plasma control was perfect."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "So, the plasma, it's a million degrees Celsius, something like that, it's hotter than the sun."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And there's obviously no material that can contain it."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "So, they have to be containing these magnetic, very powerful and superconducting magnetic fields."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "But the problem is plasma, it's pretty unstable as you imagine, you're kind of holding a mini sun, mini star in a reactor."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "So, you kind of want to predict ahead of time, what the plasma is gonna do."}, {"time": 4554, "text":

a reinforcement learning prediction problem."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So, you got controller, you're gonna move the magnetic field."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "And until we came along, they were doing it with traditional operational research type of controllers, which are kind of handcrafted."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "And the problem is, of course, they can't react in the moment to something the plasma is doing, they have to be hard coded."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And again, knowing that that's normally our go to solution is we would like to learn that instead."}, {"time": 4587, "text":

nuclear fusion?"}, {"time": 4598, "text": "Well, so with this problem, and we published it in a nature paper last year, we held the fusion, we held the plasma in a specific shapes."}, {"time": 4606,

of solved."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "So, have a controller that's able to, no matter the shape."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "Yeah, contain it and hold it in structure."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "And there's different shapes that are better for the energy productions called droplets and so on."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "So, that was huge."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And now we're looking, we're

on our compute clusters."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "And so, that generates a lot of data."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "So, in this case, the data is generated."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "So, we like those sort of systems and that's why we use games."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "It's simulated, generated data."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And we can kind of create as much of it as we want, really."},

it a little bit like the tree of all knowledge."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "If you imagine that's all the knowledge there is in the universe to attain."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "And we sort of barely

turbocharge all of that, like we've seen with AlphaFold."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "And I want to explore as much of that tree of knowledge as is possible to do."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "And I think that involves AI helping us with understanding or finding patterns, but also potentially designing and building new tools, experimental tools."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "So I think that's all, and

jump?"}, {"time": 5954, "text": "It's very difficult, which is why I think it has only been done once from the sort of specialized brains that you see in animals to this sort of general purpose,

"text": "Is it indistinguishable from a human?"}, {"time": 6423, "text": "But I think there's a second thing that makes us as humans regard each other as sentient, right?"}, {"time": 6429, "text": "Why do we think this?"}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And I debated this with Daniel Dennett."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "And I think there's a second reason that's often overlooked, which is that we're running on the same substrate, right?"}, {"time": 6438, "text": "So if we're exhibiting the same behavior, more or less as humans, and we're running on the same, you know, carbon based biological substrate, the squishy, you know, few pounds of flesh in our skulls, then the most parsimonious, I think, explanation is that you're feeling the same thing as I'm feeling, right?"}, {"time": 6455, "text": "But we will never have that second part, the substrate equivalence with a machine, right?"}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So we will have to only judge based on the behavior."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "And I think the substrate equivalence is a critical part of why we make assumptions that we're conscious."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "And in fact, even with animals, high level animals, why we think they might be, because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And we know they're made of the same things, biological neurons."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "So we're gonna have to come up with explanations or models of the gap between substrate differences, between machines and humans to get anywhere beyond the behavioral."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "But to me, sort of the practical question is very interesting and very important."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "When you have millions, perhaps billions of people believing that you have a sentient AI, believing what that Google engineer believed, which I just see as an obvious, very near term future thing, certainly on the path to AGI, how does that change the world?"}, {"time": 6513, "text": "What's the responsibility of the AI system to help those millions of people?"}, {"time": 6518, "text": "And also what's the ethical thing?"}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Because you can make a lot of people happy by creating a meaningful, deep experience with a system that's faking it before it makes it."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "And I don't, are we the right, who is to say what's the right thing to do?"}, {"time": 6539, "text": "Should AI always be tools?"}, {"time": 6541, "text": "Why are we constraining AI to always be tools as opposed to friends?"}, {"time": 6547, "text": "Yeah, I think, well, I mean, these are fantastic questions and also critical ones."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And we've been thinking about this since the start of DeepMind and before that, because we plan for success and however remote that looked like back in 2010."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental at DeepMind."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "And my current thinking on the language models and large models is they're not ready, we don't understand them well enough yet."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "And in terms of analysis tools and guard rails, what they can and can't do and so on, to deploy them at scale, because I think, there are big, still ethical questions like should an AI system always announce that it is an AI system to begin with?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "What do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings people may have about AI systems, perhaps incorrectly attributed?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "So I think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first to responsibly, before you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "That will be at least be my current position."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Over time, I'm very confident we'll have those tools like interpretability questions and analysis questions."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "And then with the ethical quandary, I think there it's important to look beyond just science."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "That's why I think philosophy, social sciences, even theology, other things like that come into it, where arts and humanities, what does it mean to be human and the spirit of being human and to enhance that and the human condition, right?"}, {"time": 6643, "text": "And allow us to experience things we could never experience before and improve the overall human condition and humanity overall, get radical abundance, solve many scientific problems, solve disease."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "So this is the era I think, this is the amazing era I think we're heading into if we do it right."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "But we've got to be careful."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "We've already seen with things like social media, how dual use technologies can be misused by, firstly, by bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors, right, so there's that set of just the common or garden misuse of existing dual use technology."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "And then of course, there's an additional thing that has to be overcome with AI that eventually it may have its own agency."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "So it could be good or bad in and of itself."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So I think these questions have to be approached very carefully using the scientific method, I would say, in terms of hypothesis generation, careful control testing, not live A, B testing out in the world, because with powerful technologies like AI, if something goes wrong, it may cause a lot of harm before you can fix it."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "It's not like an imaging app or game app where if something goes wrong, it's relatively easy to fix and the harm is relatively small."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So I think it comes with the usual cliche of, like with a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "And I think that's the case here with things like AI, given the enormous opportunity in front of us."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And I think we need a lot of voices and as many inputs into things like the design of the systems and the values they should have and what goals should they be put to."}, {"time": 6742, "text": "I think as wide a group of voices as possible beyond just the technologists is needed to input into that and to have a say in that, especially when it comes to deployment of these systems, which is when the rubber really hits the road, it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "And that's why I say, I think as a first step, it would be better if we have the choice to build these systems as tools to give, and I'm not saying that they should never go beyond tools because of course the potential is there for it to go way beyond just tools."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "But I think that would be a good first step in order for us to allow us to carefully experiment and understand what these things can do."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So the leap between tool, the sentient entity being is one we should take very careful of."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Let me ask a dark personal question."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So you're one of the most brilliant people in the AI community, you're also one of the most kind and if I may say sort of loved people in the community."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "That said, creation of a super intelligent AI system would be one of the most powerful things in the world, tools or otherwise."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And again, as the old saying goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "You are likely to be one of the people, I would say probably the most likely person to be in the control of such a system."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "Do you think about the corrupting nature of power when you talk about these kinds of systems that as all dictators and people have caused atrocities in the past, always think they're doing good, but they don't do good because the power has polluted their mind about what is good and what is evil."}, {"time": 6853, "text": "Do you think about this stuff or are we just focused on language model?"}, {"time": 6856, "text": "No, I think about them all the time and I think what are the defenses against that?"}, {"time": 6862, "text": "I think one thing is to remain very grounded and sort of humble, no matter what you do or achieve."}, {"time": 6868, "text": "And I try to do that, my best friends are still my set of friends from my undergraduate Cambridge days, my family's and friends are very important."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "I've always, I think trying to be a multidisciplinary person, it helps to keep you humble because no matter how good you are at one topic, someone will be better than you at that."}, {"time": 6887, "text": "And always relearning a new topic again from scratch is a new field is very humbling, right?"}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So for me, that's been biology over the last five years, huge area topic and I just love doing that, but it helps to keep you grounded like it keeps you open minded."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "And then the other important thing is to have a really good, amazing set of people around you at your company or your organization who are also very ethical and grounded themselves and help to keep you that way."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "And then ultimately just to answer your question, I hope we're gonna be a big part of birthing AI and that being the greatest benefit to humanity of any tool or technology ever, and getting us into a world of radical abundance and curing diseases and solving many of the big

first."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "I hope we're in the vanguard so we can influence how that goes."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "And I think it matters who builds, which cultures they come from and what values they have, the builders of AI systems."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "Cause I think even though the AI system is gonna learn for itself most of its knowledge, there'll be a residue in the system of the culture and the values of the creators of that system."}, {"time": 6977, "text": "And there's interesting questions to discuss about that geopolitically."}, {"time": 6981, "text": "Different cultures, we're in a more fragmented world than ever, unfortunately."}, {"time": 6984, "text": "I think in terms of global cooperation, we see that in things like climate where we can't seem to get our act together globally to cooperate on these pressing matters."}, {"time": 6994, "text": "I hope that will change over time."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "Perhaps if we get to an era of radical abundance, we don't have to be so competitive anymore."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "Maybe we can be more cooperative if resources aren't so scarce."}, {"time": 7004, "text": "It's true that in terms of power corrupting and leading to destructive things, it seems that some of the atrocities of the past happen when there's a significant constraint on resources."}, {"time": 7016, "text": "I think that's the first thing."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "I don't think that's enough."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "I think scarcity is one thing that's led to competition, sort of zero sum game thinking."},

enough, unfortunately, to get world peace because there's also other corrupting things like wanting power over people and this kind of stuff, which is not necessarily satisfied by just abundance."},

things."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "One is find your true passions."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "And I think you can do that by, the way to do that is to explore as many things as possible when you're young and you have the time and you can take those risks."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "I would also encourage people to look at finding the connections between things in a unique way."}, {"time": 7104,
