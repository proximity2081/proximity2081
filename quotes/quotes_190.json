going on where people's immune cells are taken out of their body, treated with a genetic therapy that revs up their ability to discover the cancer that that patient currently has, maybe even at stage four, and then give them back as those little ninja warriors go after the cancer."}, {"time": 352, "text": "It sometimes works dramatically."}, {"time": 359, "text": "That's gain of function."}, {"time": 359, "text": "You gave that patient a gain in their immune function that may have saved their life."}, {"time": 363, "text": "We've got to be careful not to say, oh, gain of function is bad."}, {"time": 363, "text": "Most of what we do in science that's good involves quite a bit of that."}, {"time": 368, "text": "We are all living with gains of function every day."}, {"time": 375, "text": "I have a gain of function because I'm wearing these eyeglasses."}, {"time": 378, "text": "Otherwise, I would not be seeing you as clearly."}, {"time": 378, "text": "I'm happy for that gain of function."}, {"time": 378, "text": "That's where a lot of confusion has happened."}, {"time": 385, "text": "The kind of gain of function which is now subject to very rigorous and very carefully defined oversight is when you are working with an established human pathogen that is known to be potentially causing a pandemic and you are enhancing or potentially enhancing its transmissibility or its virulence."}, {"time": 403, "text": "We call that EPPP, enhanced potential pandemic pathogen."}, {"time": 410, "text": "That requires this very stringent oversight worked out over three years by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity that needs to be looked at by a panel that goes well beyond NIH to decide are the benefits worth the risks in that situation."}, {"time": 434, "text": "Most of the time, it's not worth the risk."}, {"time": 434, "text": "Only three times in the last three or four years have experiments been given permission to go forward."}, {"time": 448, "text": "They were all on influenza."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So I will argue that if you're worried about the next pandemic, the more you know about the coming enemy, the better chance you have to recognize when trouble is starting."}, {"time": 460, "text": "And so if you can do it safely, studying influenza or coronaviruses like SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV2 would be a good thing to be able to know about."}, {"time": 467, "text": "But you have to be able to do it safely because we all know lab accidents can happen."}, {"time": 473, "text": "I mean, look at SARS where there have been lab accidents and people have gotten sick as a result."}, {"time": 479, "text": "We don't want to take that chance unless there's a compelling scientific reason."}, {"time": 485, "text": "That's why we have this very stringent oversight."}, {"time": 489, "text": "The experiments being done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a subaward to our grant to EcoHealth in New York did not meet that standard of requiring that kind of stringent oversight."}, {"time": 504, "text": "I want to be really clear about that because there's been so much thrown around about it."}, {"time": 509, "text": "Was it gain of function?"}, {"time": 509, "text": "Well, in the standard use of that term that you would use in science in general, you might say it was."}, {"time": 514, "text": "But in the use of that term that applies to this very specific example of a potential pandemic pathogen, absolutely not."}, {"time": 528, "text": "So nothing went on there that should not have happened based upon the oversight."}, {"time": 535, "text": "There was an instance where the grantee institution failed to notify us about the result of an experiment that they were supposed to tell us where they mixed and matched some viral genomes and got a somewhat larger viral load as a result."}, {"time": 547, "text": "But it was not EPPP."}, {"time": 547, "text": "It was not getting into that zone that would have required this higher level of scrutiny."}, {"time": 555, "text": "It was all bat viruses."}, {"time": 559, "text": "These were not human pathogens."}, {"time": 562, "text": "So they didn't cross a threshold within that gray area that makes for an EPPP?"}, {"time": 569, "text": "They did not."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And anybody who's willing to take the time to look at what EPPP means and what those experiments were would have to agree with what I just said."}, {"time": 579, "text": "What is the biggest reason it didn't cross that threshold?"}, {"time": 579, "text": "Is it because it wasn't jumping to humans?"}, {"time": 583, "text": "Is it because it did not have a sufficient increase in virulence or transmissibility?"}, {"time": 591, "text": "EPPP only applies to agents that are known human pathogens of pandemic potential."}, {"time": 591, "text": "These were all bat viruses derived in the wild, not shown to be infectious to humans."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Just looking at what happened if you took four different bat viruses and you tried moving the spike protein gene from one into one of the others to see whether it would bind better to the ACE2 receptor."}, {"time": 617, "text": "That doesn't get across that threshold."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And let me also say, for those who are trying to connect the dots here, which is the most troubling part of this, and say, well, this is how SARS CoV2 got started."}, {"time": 626, "text": "That is absolutely demonstrably false."}, {"time": 632, "text": "These bat viruses that were being studied had only about 80% similarity in their genomes to SARS CoV2."}, {"time": 640, "text": "They were like decades away in evolutionary terms."}, {"time": 640, "text": "And it is really irresponsible for people to claim otherwise."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Speaking of people who claim otherwise, Rand Paul, what do you make of the battle of words between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci over this particular point?"}, {"time": 663, "text": "I don't want to talk about specific members of Congress, but I will say it's really unfortunate that Tony Fauci, who is the epitome of a dedicated public servant, has now somehow been targeted for political reasons as somebody that certain figures are trying to discredit, perhaps to try to distract from their own failings."}, {"time": 683, "text": "This never should have happened."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And that is disgraceful."}, {"time": 720, "text": "So with politicians, they often play games with black and white."}, {"time": 720, "text": "They try to sort of use the gray areas of science and then paint their own picture."}, {"time": 726, "text": "But I have a question about the gray areas of science."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So like you mentioned, gain of function is a term that has very specific scientific meaning, but it also has a more general term."}, {"time": 739, "text": "And it's very possible to argue that the, not to argue, not the way politicians argue, but just as human beings and scientists, that there was a gain of function achieved at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but it didn't cross a threshold."}, {"time": 758, "text": "I mean, there's a, it's a, but it could have too."}, {"time": 764, "text": "When you do these kinds of experiments, unexpected results may be achieved."}, {"time": 764, "text": "And that's the gray area of science."}, {"time": 770, "text": "You're taking risks with such experiments."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And I am very uncomfortable that we can't discuss the uncertainty in the gray area of this."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Oh, I'm comfortable discussing the gray area."}, {"time": 783, "text": "What I'm uncomfortable with is people deciding to define for themselves what that threshold is based on sort of some political argument."}, {"time": 794, "text": "The threshold was very explicitly laid out."}, {"time": 794, "text": "Everybody agreed to that in the basis of this three years of deliberation."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So that's what it is."}, {"time": 801, "text": "If that threshold needs to be reconsidered, let's reconsider it, but let's not try to take an experiment that's already been done and decide that the threshold isn't what it was, because that really is doing a disservice to the whole process."}, {"time": 818, "text": "I wish there was a discussion, even in response to Rand Paul, I know we're not talking about specific senators, but just that particular case, I'm saying stuff here."}, {"time": 824, "text": "I wish there was an opportunity to talk about, given the current threshold, this is not gain of function."}, {"time": 835, "text": "But maybe we need to reconsider the threshold and have an action."}, {"time": 835, "text": "That's an opportunity for discussion about the ethics of gain of function."}, {"time": 838, "text": "You said that there was three studies that passed that threshold with influenza."}, {"time": 842, "text": "That's a fascinating human question, scientific question about ethics, because like you said, there's pros and cons."}, {"time": 847, "text": "You're taking risks here to prevent horribly destructive viruses in the future, but you also are risking creating such viruses in the future."}, {"time": 864, "text": "With nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, nuclear energy promises a lot of positive effects, and yet you're taking risks here."}, {"time": 873, "text": "With mutually shared destruction, nations possessing nuclear weapons, a lot of people argue that nuclear weapons is the reason we've prevented world wars, and yet they also have the risk of starting world wars."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And this is what we have to be honest about with the benefits and risks of science, that you have to make that calculation."}, {"time": 901, "text": "What are the pros and what are the cons?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "I'm totally with you, but I want to reassure you, Lex, that this is not an issue that's been ignored."}, {"time": 934, "text": "Now, we actually back in January of 2020, just before COVID 19 changed everything, had planned and even charged that same National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity to reconvene and look at the current framework and say, do we have it right?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "Let's look at the experience over those three years and say, is the threshold too easy, too hard?"}, {"time": 960, "text": "Do we need to reconsider it?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "Let's look at the experience."}, {"time": 966, "text": "COVID came along, the members of the board said, please, we're all infectious disease experts."}, {"time": 970, "text": "We don't have time for this right now."}, {"time": 970, "text": "But I think the time is right to do this."}, {"time": 974, "text": "I'm totally supportive of that."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And that should be just as public a discussion as you can imagine about what are the benefits and the risks."}, {"time": 983, "text": "And if somebody decided, ultimately, this came together and said, we just shouldn't be doing these experiments under any circumstances."}, {"time": 987, "text": "If that was the conclusion, well, that would be the conclusion."}, {"time": 991, "text": "But it hasn't been so far."}, {"time": 995, "text": "If we can briefly look out into the next hundred years on this."}, {"time": 995, "text": "I apologize for the existential questions."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "But it seems obvious to me that as gain of function type of research and development becomes easier and cheaper, it will become greater and greater risk."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So if it doesn't no longer need to be contained within laboratories of high security, it feels like this is one of the greatest threats facing human civilization."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Do you worry that at some point in the future a leaked manmade virus may destroy most of human civilization?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "I do worry about the risks."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And at the moment where we have the greatest control, the greatest oversight is when this is federally funded research."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "But as you're alluding, there's no reason to imagine that's the only place that this kind of activity would go on."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "If there was an evil source that wished to create a virus that was highly pathogenic in their garage, the technology does get easier."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And there is no international oversight about this either that you could say has the same stringency as what we have in the United States."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "So yes, that is a concern."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "It would take a seriously deranged group or person to undertake this on purpose, given the likelihood that they too would go down."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "We don't imagine there are going to be bioweapons that only kill your enemies and don't kill you."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "Sorry, we're too much alike for that to work."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So I don't see it as an imminent risk."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "There's lots of scary novels and movies written about it."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "But I do think it's something we have to consider."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "What are all the things that ought to be watched?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "You may not know that if somebody is ordering a particular oligonucleotide from one of the main suppliers, and it happens to match smallpox, they're going to get caught."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So there is effort underway to try to track any nefarious actions that might be going on."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "In the United States or internationally?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Is there an international collaboration of try to track this stuff?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "There is some."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "I wish it were stronger."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "This is a general issue, Lex, in terms of do we have a mechanism, particularly when it comes to ethical issues, to be able to decide what's allowable and what's not and enforce it."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "I mean, look where we are with germline genome editing for humans, for instance."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "There is no enforcement mechanism."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "There's just bully pulpits and governments that get to decide for themselves."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "You talked about evil."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "What about incompetence?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Does that worry you?"}, {"time": 1166, "text": "My dad, a physicist, worked at Chernobyl."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "That wasn't evil."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "I don't know what word you want to put it."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Maybe incompetence is too harsh."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Maybe it's the inherent incompetence of bureaucracy."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "But for whatever reason, there was an accident."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "We know that SARS, for instance, did manage to leak out of a lab in China two or three times."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "At least in some instances, people died, fortunately quickly contained."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "All one can do in that circumstance, because you need to study the virus and understand it in order to keep it from causing a broader pandemic, but you need to insist upon the kind of biosecurity, the BSL 2, 3, and 4 framework under which those experiments have to be done."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Certainly at NIH, we're extremely rigorous about that, but you can't count on every human being to always do exactly what they're supposed to."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "There's a risk there, which is another reason why if we're contemplating supporting research on pathogens that might be the next pandemic, you have to factor that in, not just whether people are going to do something that we couldn't have predicted, where all of a sudden they created a virus that's much worse without knowing they were going to do that, but also just having an accident."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "That's in the mix when those estimates are done about whether the risk is worth it or not."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Continuing on line of difficult questions."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "We're going to get to fun stuff after a while."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "We will soon, I promise."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "You are the director of the NIH."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "You are Dr. Anthony Fauci's, technically his boss."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You have stood behind him."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You have supported him, just like you did already in this conversation."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "It is painful for me to see division and distrust, but many people in politics and elsewhere have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "When there are such calls of distrust in public about a leader like Anthony Fauci, who should garner trust, do you think he should be fired?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "To do so would be basically to give the opportunity for those who want to make up stories about anybody to destroy them."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "There is nothing in the ways in which Tony Fauci has been targeted that is based upon truth."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "How could we then accept those cries for his firing as having legitimacy?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "It's a circular argument."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "They've decided they don't like Tony, so they make up stuff and they twist comments that he's made about things like gain of function, where he's referring to the very specific gain of function that's covered by this policy, and they're trying to say he lied to the Congress."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "That's simply not true."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "They don't like the fact that Tony changes the medical recommendations about what to do with COVID 19 over the space of more than a year."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "They call that flip flopping and you can't trust the guy because he says one thing last year and one thing this year."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Well, the science has changed."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Delta variant has changed everything."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "You don't want him to be saying the same thing he did a year ago."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "That would be wrong now."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "It was the best we could do then."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "People don't understand that or else they don't want to understand it."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "So when you basically whip up a largely political argument against a scientist and hammer at it over and over again to the point where he now has to have 24 seven security to protect him against people who really want to do violence to him."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "For that to be a reason to say that then he should be fired is to hand the evil forces the victory."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "I will not do that."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Yet there's something difficult I'm going to try to express to you."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So it may be your guitar playing."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "It may be something else, but there's a humility to you."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "It may be because you're a man of God."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "There's a humility to you that garners trust."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "And when you're in a leadership position representing science, especially in catastrophic events like the pandemic, it feels like as a leader, you have to go far above and beyond your usual duties."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And I think there's no question that Anthony Fauci has delivered on his duties, but it feels like he needs to go above as a science communicator."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "And if there's a large number of people that are distrusting him, it's also his responsibility to garner their trust to gain their trust as a person who's the face of science."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Do you, are you torn on this?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "The responsibility of Anthony Fauci of yourself to represent science, not just the communication of advising what should be done, but giving people hope, giving people trust in science and alleviating division."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Do you think that's also responsibility of a leader or is that unfair to ask?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "I think the best way you give people trust is to tell them the truth."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And so they recognize that when you're sharing information, it's the best you've got at that point."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And Tony Fauci does that at every moment."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "I don't think him expressing more humility would change the fact that they're looking for a target of somebody to blame, to basically distract people from the failings of their own political party."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "Maybe I'm less targeted, not because of a difference in the way in which I convey the information."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "I'm less visible."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "If Tony were out of the scene and I was placed in that role, I'd probably be seeing a ratcheting up of that same targeting."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "I would like to believe that if Tony Fauci said that when I originally made recommendations not to wear masks, that was given on the, on the, our best available data."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And now we know that is a mistake."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So admit with humility that there's an error."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "That's not, that's not actually correct, but that's a, that's a statement of humility."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "And I would like to believe, despite the attacks, he would win a lot of people over with that."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "So a lot of people, as you're saying, would use that, see that here we go, here's that Dr. Anthony Fauci making mistakes."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "How can we trust them on anything?"}, {"time": 1573, "text": "I believe if he was that public display of humility to say that I made an error, that would win a lot of people over."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "That's my, that's kind of my sense to face the fire of the attacks from politics."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "You have to, like politicians will attack no matter what, but the question is the people, to win over the people."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "The biggest concern I've had is that there was this, this stress of science that's been brewing and I'm, maybe you can correct me, but I'm a little bit unwilling to fully blame the politicians because politicians play their games no matter what."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "It just feels like this was an opportunity to inspire people with the power of science."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "The development of the vaccines, no matter what you think of those vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of science."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "And the fact that that's not inspiring, listen, I host a podcast."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "Whenever I say positive stuff about the vaccine, I get to hear a lot of different opinions."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "The fact that I do is a big problem to me because it's an incredible, an incredible accomplishment of science."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "And so I, I, I, I, I'm sorry, but I have to put responsibility on the leaders, even if it's not their mistakes."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "That's what the leadership is."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "That's what leadership is."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "You take responsibility for the situation."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I wonder if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope that science will save us as opposed to science will divide us."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "I think you have more confidence in the ability to get beyond our current divisions than I do after seeing just how deep and dark they have become."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "Tony Fauci has said multiple times the recommendation about not wearing masks was for two reasons, a shortage of masks, which were needed in hospitals and a lack of realization early in the course of the epidemic that this was a virus that could heavily infect asymptomatic people."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "As that changed, he changed."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "Now, did he make an error?"}, {"time": 1714, "text": "No, he was making a judgment based on the data available at the time, but he certainly made that clear over and over again."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "It has not stopped those who would like to demonize him from saying, well, he just flip flopped."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "You can't trust a guy."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "He says one thing today and one thing tomorrow."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "Well, masks is a tricky one."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "So I'm actually early on, I'm a coauthor on a paper, one of many, but this was a survey paper overlooking the, the evidence."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "It's a summary of the evidence we have for the effectiveness of masks."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "It seems that it's difficult to do rigorous scientific study on masks."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "There's a lot of philosophical and ethical questions I want to ask you, but within this, it's back to your words and Anthony Fauci's words."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "When you're dealing with so much uncertainty and so much potential uncertainty about how catastrophic this virus is in the early days, and knowing that each word you say may create panic, how do you communicate science with the world?"}, {"time": 1787, "text": "It's a philosophical, it's an ethical, it's a practical question."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "There was a discussion about masks a century ago and that too led to panic."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So, I mean, I'm trying to put myself in the mind, in your mind, in the mind of Anthony Fauci in those early days, knowing that there's limited supply of masks."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Like, what do you say?"}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Do you fully convey the uncertainty of the situation of the, of the challenges of the supply chain?"}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Or do you say that masks don't work?"}, {"time": 1823, "text": "That's a complicated calculation."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "How do you make that calculation?"}, {"time": 1832, "text": "It is a complicated calculation."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "As a scientist, your temptation would be to give a full brain dump of all the details of the information about what's known and what isn't known and what experiments need to be done."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Most of the time that's not going to play well in a soundbite on the evening news."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So you have to kind of distill it down to a recommendation that is the best you can do at that time with the information you've got."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "So you're a man of God."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And we'll return to that to talk about some, some also unanswerable philosophical questions."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "But first let's linger on the vaccine because in the, in the religious, in the Christian community, there was some hesitancy with the
