spatial dimensional world and we have intimate understanding of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things."}, {"time": 350, "text": "But these things that we've discovered in both math and physics are, that they're not at all close, have any obvious connection to kind of human everyday experience."}, {"time": 362, "text": "They're really quite different."}, {"time": 363, "text": "And I can say some of my initial fascination with this when I was young and starting to learn about it was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature of these things."}, {"time": 375, "text": "It was a little bit like being told, well, there are these kind of semi mystical experience that you can acquire by a long study and whatever, except that it was actually true."}, {"time": 387, "text": "There's actually evidence that this actually works."}, {"time": 389, "text": "So I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people that kind of thing, because I think it's mostly misleading."}, {"time": 395, "text": "But one thing to say is that geometry is a large part of it."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And maybe one interesting thing to say very, that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas is that when we think about the geometry of our space and time, it's kind of three spatial and one time dimension."}, {"time": 413, "text": "It's a physics is in some sense about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way."}, {"time": 420, "text": "And a really interesting thing about some of the recent developments and number theory have been to realize that these ideas that we were looking at naturally fit into a context where your theory is kind of four dimensional."}, {"time": 435, "text": "So, geometry is a big part of this and we know a lot and feel a lot about two, one, two, three dimensional geometry."}, {"time": 444, "text": "So wait a minute, so we can at least rely on the four dimensions of space and time and say that we can get pretty far by working in those four dimensions."}, {"time": 455, "text": "I thought you were gonna scare me that we're gonna have to go to many, many, many, many more dimensions than that."}, {"time": 507, "text": "That kind of thing leaves us astray, you think?"}, {"time": 509, "text": "So creating all these extra dimensions just to give yourself extra degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Isn't that the process of mathematics is to create all of these trajectories for yourself but eventually you have to end up at the final place but it's okay to sort of create abstract objects on your path to proving something."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Yeah, certainly and from a mathematician's point of view, I mean, the kinds of, mathematicians also are very different than physicists in that we like to develop very general theories."}, {"time": 546, "text": "We like to, if we have an idea, we want to see what's the greatest generality in which you can talk about it."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So from the point of view of most of the ways geometry is formulated by mathematicians, it really doesn't matter, it works in any dimension."}, {"time": 559, "text": "We can do one, two, three, four, any number."}, {"time": 562, "text": "There's no particular, for most of geometry, there's no particular special thing about four."}, {"time": 568, "text": "But anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do over the years is try to understand these fundamental theories in a geometrical way and it's very tempting to kind of just start bringing in extra dimensions and using them to explain the structure."}, {"time": 586, "text": "But typically this attempt kind of founders because you just don't know, you end up not being able to explain why we only see four."}, {"time": 599, "text": "It is nice in the space of physics that like if you look at Fermat's last theorem, it's much easier to prove that there's no solution for n equals three than it is for the general case."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist is you don't have to worry about the general case because we live in a universe with n equals four in this case."}, {"time": 655, "text": "And I'm less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem about exactly when it's gonna work and when it's not gonna work."}, {"time": 662, "text": "Do you usually think about really simple examples, like both for teaching and when you try to solve a difficult problem, do you construct the simplest possible examples that captures the fundamentals of the problem and try to solve it?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "Yeah, exactly, that's often a really fruitful way to if you've got some idea to just kind of try to boil it down to what's the simplest situation in which this kind of thing is gonna happen and then try to really understand that and understand that and that is almost always a really good way to get insight into it."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Do you work with paper and pen or like, for example, for me coming from the programming side, if I look at a model, if I look at some kind of mathematical object, I like to mess around with it sort of numerically."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Well, the problem with this kind of stuff I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of, it's rarely something that is really kind of, or even the simplest example, you can kind of see what's going on by looking at something happening in three dimensions."}, {"time": 762, "text": "There's generally the structures involved are either they're more abstract or if you try to kind of embed them in some kind of space and where you could manipulate them in some kind of geometrical way, it's gonna be a much higher dimensional space."}, {"time": 777, "text": "So even simple examples, the embedding them into three dimensional space, you're losing a lot."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Yeah, but to capture what you're trying to understand about them, you have to go to four or more dimensions."}, {"time": 819, "text": "Are we supposed to be sad or excited by the fact that our human minds can't fully comprehend the kind of mathematics you're talking about?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "I mean, what do we make of that?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "I mean, to me, that makes you quite sad."}, {"time": 830, "text": "It makes it seem like there's a giant mystery out there that we'll never truly get to experience directly."}, {"time": 838, "text": "It is kind of sad how difficult this is."}, {"time": 841, "text": "I mean, or I would put it a different way that most questions that people have about this kind of thing, you can give them a really true answer and really understand it but the problem is one more of time."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Speaking of a limited amount of time, we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together here on this podcast."}, {"time": 897, "text": "Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas that you work on in mathematics and physics, which is the most beautiful idea or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea and once again, unfortunately, the way life works, we only have a limited time together to try to convey such an idea."}, {"time": 918, "text": "Okay, well, actually, let me just tell you something which I'm tempted to kind of start trying to explain what I think is this most powerful idea that brings together math and physics, ideas about groups and representations and how it fits in quantum mechanics but in some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that and I don't think we really have time to get very far into it so."}, {"time": 939, "text": "Well, can I actually, on a small tangent, you did write a paper towards a grant unified theory mathematics and physics, maybe you could step there first, what is the key idea in that paper?"}, {"time": 949, "text": "Well, I think we've kind of gone over that."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Could you put words to sort of the disciplines we're trying to unify?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So you said number theory, are we literally talking about all the major fields of mathematics?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So it's like the number theory, geometry, so the differential geometry, topology."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this that this is acquired in mathematics is the so called Langlands program and so this started out in mathematics."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "One of the things that makes me sad is I'm a pretty knowledgeable person and then, what is it?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "At least I'm in the neighborhood like theoretical computer science, right?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And it's still way out of my reach and so many people talk about like Langlands, for example, is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics and just really admire his work and I can't, it's like almost I can't hear the music that he composed and it makes me sad."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, I think unfortunately, it's not just you, it's I think even most mathematicians have no, really don't actually understand what this is about."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Well, if we can step into the back to the question of beauty, is there an idea that maybe is a little bit smaller that you find beautiful in the space of mathematics or physics?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "There's an idea that I kind of went, got a physics PhD and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics and I guess it was embarrassing that I hadn't really actually understand this very simple idea until I kind of learned it when I actually started teaching math classes, which is maybe that there's a simple way to explain kind of the fundamental way in which algebra and geometry are connected."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So one of the most surprising examples of this, for instance, is a standard kind of thing that seems to have nothing to do with geometry is the integers."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So you can multiply them and add them, it's an algebra but it seems to have nothing to do with geometry but what you can, it turns out, but if you ask yourself this question and ask, you know, are integers, can you think, if somebody gives you an integer, can you think of it as a function on some space, on some geometry?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "And it turns out that yes, you can and the space is the space of prime numbers and so what you do is you just, if somebody gives you an integer, you can make a function on the prime numbers by just, you know, at each prime number taking that, that integer modulo that prime."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "So if you say, I don't know, if you're given 10, you know, 10 and you ask, what is its value at two?"}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Well, it's five times two, so mod two, it's zero, so it's zero one."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "What is its value at three?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "Well, it's nine plus one, so it's one mod three."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So it's zero at two, it's one at three and you can kind of keep going."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "It's at the basis of what's called algebraic geometry and it just links these two parts of mathematics that look completely different and it's just an incredibly powerful idea and so much of mathematics emerges from this kind of simple relation."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So you're talking about mapping from one discrete space to another."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "So for a second, I thought perhaps mapping like a continuous space to a discrete space, like functions over a continuous space, because yeah."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Well, I mean, you can take, if somebody gives you a space, you can ask, you can say, well, let's, and this is also, this is part of the same idea."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "The part of the same idea is that if you try and do geometry and somebody tells you, here's a space, that what you should do is you should wait, so say, wait a minute, maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And so if I do that, the way to start is, you give me the space, I start to think about the functions of the space, okay?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "So for each point in the space, I associate a number."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "I can take different kinds of functions and different kinds of values, but basically functions on a space."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "So what this insight is telling you is that if you're a geometer, often the way to work is to change your problem into algebra by changing your space, stop thinking about your space and the points in it and think about the functions on it."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "And if you're an algebraist and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets that you're multiplying and adding, say, wait a minute, are those gadgets, can I think of them in some way as a function on a space?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "What would that space be and what kind of functions would they be?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And that going back and forth really brings these two completely different looking areas of mathematics together."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Do you have particular examples where it allowed to prove some difficult things by jumping from one to the other?"}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics where such jumps are made?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Oh yeah, this is kind of all the time."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Much of modern number theory is kind of based on this idea."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "But, and when you start doing this, you start to realize that you need, what simple things on one side of the algebra start to require you to think about the other side, about geometry in a new way."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea about geometry, or if you start thinking about the functions on a space, you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "But in some sense, I mean, much or most of modern number theory is based upon this move to geometry."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "And there's also a lot of geometry and topology is also based upon, yeah, change."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "If you want to understand the topology of something, you look at the functions, you do drum comology and you get the topology."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "You said that this idea is beautiful."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And why is this beautiful?"}, {"time": 1524, "text": "First, why is this beautiful?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And second, what is beautiful?"}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Yeah, well, and I think there are many different things you can find beautiful for different reasons."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty, I think really is just kind of an idea is beautiful if it's packages a huge amount of kind of power and information into something very simple."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "What non trivial things does it tell you versus how simply can you express the idea?"}, {"time": 1567, "text": "So the level of compression, what is it correlates with beauty?"}, {"time": 1572, "text": "Yeah, that's one aspect of it."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And so you can start to tell that an idea is becoming uglier and uglier as you start kind of having to, it doesn't quite do what you want."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So you throw in something else to the idea and you keep doing that until you get what you want."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "But that's how you know you're doing something uglier and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding and more into what was originally a fairly simple idea and making it more and more complicated to get what you want."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "Okay, so let's put some philosophical words on the table and try to make some sense of them."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "One word is beauty, another one is simplicity as you mentioned, another one is truth."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So do you have a sense if I give you two theories, one is simpler, one is more complicated."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true to capture deeply the fabric of reality, the simple one or the more complicated one?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "Yeah, I think all of our evidence, what we see in the history of the subject is the simpler one though."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Often it's a surprise, it's simpler in a surprising way."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "But yeah, that we just don't, we just, anyway, the kind of best theories we've been coming up with are ultimately when properly understood, relatively simple and much, much simpler than you would expect them to be."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Do you have a good explanation why that is?"}, {"time": 1663, "text": "Is it just because humans want it to be that way?"}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Are we just like ultra biased and we just kind of convince ourselves that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Or is there something about our actual universe that at the core is simple?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "My own belief is that there is something about a universe that's simple and as I was trying to say that, there is some kind of fundamental thing about math, physics and all this picture, which is in some sense simple."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "It's true that, it's of course true that our minds have certain, are very limited and can certainly do certain things and not others."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "So it's in principle possible that there's some great insight in, there are a lot of insights into the way the world works, which just aren't accessible to us because that's not the way our minds work, we don't."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And that what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity is just because that's all we ever have any hope of seeing."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "So there's a brilliant physicist by the name of Sabine Hassenfelder who both agrees and disagrees with you."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "But simplicity and beauty leads us astray in the local pockets of scientific progress."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Do you agree with her disagreement and do you disagree with her agreement?"}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And agree with the agreement and so on."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Anyway, yes, I found it was really fascinating reading her book and anyway, I was finding disagreeing with a lot, but then at the end when she says yes, when we find, when we actually figure this out, it will be simple and okay, so we agree in the end."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "But does beauty lead us astray, which is the core thesis of her work in that book."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "I don't think, and especially, and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her about sometimes the way she'll refer to math."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And so the problem is, physicists and people in general just refer to it as math and they're often meaning not what I would call math, which is the interesting ideas of math, but just some complicated calculation."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very, the problem with talking about simplicity and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very, it's very easy to fool yourself and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great and you fall in love with it."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And it's like any kind of love affair, it's very easy to believe that the object of your affections is much more beautiful than the others might think and that they really are."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "And that's very, very easy to do."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So if you say, I'm just gonna pursue ideas about beauty and this and mathematics and this, it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "I see, so it's not that the simplicity of beauty leads us astray, it's just people are people and they fall in love with whatever idea they have and then they weave narratives around that idea or they present it in such a way that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "Yeah, that's part of it."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "I think her emphasis is more, that I don't really disagree with, is that people should be concentrating on when they're trying to develop better theories on more on self consistency, not so much on beauty, but not is this idea beautiful, but is there something about the theory which is not quite consistent and use that as a guide that there's something wrong there which needs fixing."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "And so I think that part of her argument, I think we're on the same page about."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "What is consistency and inconsistencies?"}, {"time": 1968, "text": "What exactly, do you have examples in mind?"}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Well, it can be just simple inconsistency between theory and an experiment that if you, so we have this great fundamental theory, but there are some things that we see out there which don't seem to fit in it, like dark energy and dark matter, for instance."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "But if there's something which you can't test experimentally, I think she would argue and I would agree that, for instance, if you're trying to think about gravity and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, you should kind of test any of your ideas with kind of a thought experiment."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "Does this actually give a consistent picture of what's gonna happen, of what happens in this particular situation or not?"}, {"time": 2013, "text": "You've written about this."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Since quantum gravitational effects are really small, super small, arguably unobservably small, should we have hope to arrive at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?"}, {"time": 2029, "text": "What are the different ways we can get there?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "You've mentioned that you're not as interested in that effort because basically, yes, you cannot have ways to scientifically validate it given the tools of today."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Yeah, I've actually, you know, I've over the years certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn't been that much in the past the focus of what I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "But I mean, my feeling was always, you know, as I think Sabina would agree that the, you know, one way you can pursue this if you can't do experiments is just this kind of search for consistency."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "You know, it can be remarkably hard to come up with a completely consistent model of this in a way that brings together quantum mechanics and general relativity."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way that people who have pursued quantum gravity have often pursued, you know, we have the best route to finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity and string theorists will tell you this, other people will tell you it, it's kind of what people argue about."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "But the problem with all of that is that you end up, you know, the danger is that you end up with, that everybody could be successful."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Everybody's program for how to find a theory of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something that is consistent."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "And so, and in some sense you could argue this is what happened to the string theorists."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "They solved their problem of finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity and they ended up, but they found 10 to the 500 solutions."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So you, you know, if you believe that everything that they would like to be true is true, well, okay, you've got a theory, but it ends up being kind of useless because it's just one of an infinite, essentially infinite number of things which you have no way to experimentally distinguish."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "And so this is just a depressing situation."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "But I do think that there is a, so again, I think pursuing ideas about what, more about beauty and how can you integrate and unify these issues about gravity with other things we know about physics."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "And can you find a theory where these fit together in a way that makes sense and hopefully predict something."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "That's much more promising."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "Well, it makes sense and hopefully, I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things which is like, it's nice to have a theory that's consistent, but then if the theory is consistent, it doesn't necessarily mean anything."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "It's not enough, it's not enough."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "It's not enough and that's the problem."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "So it's like, it keeps coming back to, okay, there should be some experimental validation."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "So, okay, let's talk a little bit about strength theory."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of strength theory."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Maybe one question first to ask is what is strength theory?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And beyond that, why is it wrong?"}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Or rather as the title of your blog says, not even wrong."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Well, one interesting thing about the current state of strength theory is that, I think it, I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult to at this point to say what strength theory means."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "If people say they're a strength theorist, what they mean and what they're doing is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "But the initial meaning I think goes back to, there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984 in which people felt that they had found a unified theory of our so called standard model of all the standard, well known kind of particle interactions and gravity and it all fit together in a quantum theory."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "And that you could do this in a very specific way by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory of particles moving around in space time, think about a quantum theory of kind of one dimensional loops moving around in space time, so called strings."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And so instead of one degree of freedom, these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "It's a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine, okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of loops moving around in space time."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And what they found is that you could do this and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly make sense of such a quantum theory, but only if space and time together were 10 dimensional."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And so then you had this problem, again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of, okay, now once you make that move, you gotta get rid of six dimensions."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And so the hope was that you could get rid of the six dimensions by making them very small and that consistency of the theory would require that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition called being a Calabi out manifold."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And that we knew very, very few examples of this."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85 was the hope that you could just take this 10 dimensional string theory and find one of a limited number of possible ways of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small and then you would end up with an effective four dimensional theory, which looked like the real world."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "This was the hope."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "So then there's then a very long story about what happened to that hope over the years."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "But it was kind of in the realm of ideas which initially looked good, but the more you look at them, they just, they don't work out the way you want and they don't actually end up carrying the power or that you originally had this vision of."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And yes, the book title is not even wrong."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "What are the different flavors of ideas that came, like that branched out?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "You mentioned 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "You mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "What other interesting ideas to you that kind of emerged from this world?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, the problem with talking about the whole subject and part of the reason I wrote the book is that it gets very, very complicated."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "I mean, there's a huge amount, a lot of people got very interested in this, a lot of people worked on it."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And in some sense, I think what happened is exactly because the idea didn't really work that this caused people to, instead of focusing on this one idea and digging in and working on that, they just kind of kept trying new things."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "And so people, I think, ended up wandering around in a very, very rich space of ideas about mathematics and physics and discovering all sorts of really interesting things."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "It's just the problem is there tended to be an inverse relationship between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful this new idea that they were trying to pursue was and how much it looked like the real world."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "I think one of the most spectacular is what the physicists call two dimensional conformal field theory."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "And so these are basically quantum field theories and kind of think of it as one space and one time dimension, which have just this huge amount of symmetry and a huge amount of structure, which there's some totally fantastic mathematics behind it."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And again, and some of that mathematics is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics around the Langlands program has been around these two dimensional conformal field theories."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "Is there something you could say about what are the major problems are with string theory?"}, {"time": 2538, "text": "So like, besides that there's no experimental validation, you've written that a big hole in string theory has been its perturbative definition."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "Perhaps that's one, can you explain what that means?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Well, maybe to begin with, I think the simplest thing to say is, the initial idea really was that, okay, we have this, instead of what's great is we have this thing that only works, it's very structured and has to work in a certain way for it to make sense."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "But then you ended up in 10 space time dimensions."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And so to get back to physics, you had to get rid of five of the dimensions, six of the dimensions."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "And the bottom line I would say in some sense is very simple that what people just discovered is just, there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this, there's an infinite number of ways of doing it and you can get whatever you want depending on how you do it."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So you end up the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions and getting to four just kind of collapses out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want because you can get anything."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "The hope around that problem has always been that the standard formulation that we have of string theory, which is, you can go by the name perturbative, but it's kind of, there's a standard way we know of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory and working with it, which is the so called perturbation theory that we know how to do."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "And that by itself just doesn't give you any hint as to what to do about the six dimensions."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "So actual perturbed string theory by itself really only works in 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions about how I'm gonna go beyond this formulation that we really understand of string theory and get rid of these six dimensions."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So kind of the simplest one was the Klabiau postulate, but when that didn't really work out, people have tried more and more different things."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "And the hope has always been that the solution, this problem would be that you would find a deeper and better understanding of what string theory is that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion and which would generalize this."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "And that once you had that, it would solve this problem of, it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "So if I could restate the problem, it seems like there's a very consistent physical world operating in four dimensions."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "And how do you map a consistent physical world in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world in four dimensions?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And how difficult is this problem?"}, {"time": 2723, "text": "Is that something you can even answer?"}, {"time": 2727, "text": "Just in terms of physics intuition, in terms of mathematics, mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid of the six of the dimensions."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "So there's kind of two ways of doing it."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "One is what we called compactification."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "You say that there really are 10 dimensions, but for whatever reason, six of them are so, so small, we can't see them."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "So you basically start out with 10 dimensions and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity, but just kind of a finite extent and then make that size go down so small, it's unobservable."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "But that's like, that's a math trick."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "So can you also help me build an intuition about how rich and interesting the world in those six dimensions is?"}, {"time": 2777, "text": "So compactification seems to imply... Well, it's not very interesting."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn if you start doing mathematics and looking at geometry and topology and more and more dimensions is that, I mean, asking the question like, what are all possible six dimensional spaces?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "It's just, it's kind of an unnatural question."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "It's just, I mean, it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "There are too many things you can do with all these, if you start trying to make, if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces, it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle, you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But as you go to higher and higher dimensions, there are just so many ways you can put things together of and get something of that dimensionality."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "And so unless you have some very, very strong principle, we're just gonna pick out some very specific ones of these six dimensional spaces."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And there are just too many of them and you can get anything you want."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "So if you have 10 dimensions, the kind of things that happen, say that's actually the way, that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "There's a limited set of behaviors of objects."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I don't know even know what the right terminology to use that can occur within those dimensions, like in reality."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "And so like what I'm getting at is like, is there some consistent constraints?"}, {"time": 2867, "text": "So if you have some constraints that map to reality, then you can start saying like, dimension number seven is kind of boring."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions, one, two, three."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And time is also kind of boring."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And like some are more exciting than others, or we can use our metric of beauty."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Some dimensions are more beautiful than others."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Once you have an actual understanding of what actually happens in those dimensions in our physical world, as opposed to sort of all the possible things that could happen."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "In some sense, I mean, just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "We don't see them."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "So you need to somehow explain them."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "The main thing you're trying to do is to explain why we're not seeing them."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "And so you have to come up with some theory of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And string theory gives you some ideas about how to do that."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "But the bottom line is where you're trying to go with this whole theory you're creating is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So it's not a really, it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing that you're trying to do there."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Why are you just adding in all this stuff and then trying to explain why we don't see it?"}, {"time": 2943, "text": "This may be a dumb question, but is this an obvious thing to state that those six dimensions are unobservable or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Or do you leave a little door open to saying the current tools of physics, and obviously our brains aren't unable to observe them, but we may need to come up with methodologies for observing them."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory into four dimensions, leaving the door open a little bit too, maybe we need to come up with tools that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask, assume that we've got model, look at models with more dimensions and ask, what would the observable effects, how would we know this?"}, {"time": 2994, "text": "And you go out and do experiments."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "So for instance, you have a, like gravitationally you have an inverse square law of forces."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "If you had more dimensions, that inverse square law would change to something else."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law and say, okay, inverse square law is working, but maybe if I get, and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard to measure gravitational effects and even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances because they're so small."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "So you can start looking at the inverse square law and say, start trying to measure it at shorter and shorter distances and see if there were extra dimensions at those distance scales, you would start to see the inverse square law fail."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "And so people look for that and again, you don't see it, but you can, I mean, there's all sorts of experiments of this kind you can imagine which test for effects of extra dimensions at different distance scales, but none of them, I mean, they all just don't work."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Nothing yet."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Nothing yet, but you could say, ah, but it's just much, much smaller, you can say that."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "Which by the way makes LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves quite an incredible project."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Ed Witten is often brought up as one of the most brilliant mathematicians and physicists ever."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "What do you make of him and his work on string theory?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "I've had the pleasure of meeting him first when he was a postdoc."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And I mean, he's just completely amazing mathematician and physicist."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "And he's quite a bit smarter than just about any of the rest of us and also more hardworking."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "It's a kind of frightening combination to see how much he's been able to do."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "But I would actually argue that his greatest work, the things that he's done that have been of just this mind blowing significance of giving us, I mean, he's completely revolutionized some areas of mathematics."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "He's totally revolutionized the way we understand the relations between mathematics and physics."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And most of those, his greatest work is stuff that has little or nothing to do with string theory."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "I mean, for instance, so he was actually one of Fields."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "The very strange thing about him in some sense is that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So there's a very large number of people who are nowhere near as smart as he is and don't work anywhere near as hard who have Nobel Prizes."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "I think he just had the misfortune of coming into the field at a time when things had gotten much, much, much tougher and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were, it was very hard to come up with a new idea that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "But he got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did in mathematics, and that's just completely unheard of."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "For mathematicians to give a Fields Medal to someone outside their field in physics is really, you wouldn't have, before he came around, I don't think anybody would have thought that was even conceivable."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So you're saying he came into the field of theoretical physics at a time when, and still to today, is you can't get a Nobel Prize for purely theoretical work."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "The specific problem of trying to do better than the standard, the standard model is just this insanely successful thing, and it kind of came together in 1973, pretty much."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "And all of the people who kind of were involved in that coming together, many of them ended up with Nobel Prizes for that."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "But if you look post 1973, pretty much, it's a little bit more, there's some edge cases, if you like, but if you look post 1973 at what people have done to try to do better than the standard model and to get a better idea, it really hasn't, it's been too hard a problem."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "It hasn't worked."},

just that no one really, the kind of thing he's been trying to do with string theory is not, no one has been able to do since 1973."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "Is there something you can say about the

gravity, that we have trouble."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So you want to, in some sense, integrate what we know about the gravitational force with it and have a unified quantum field theory that has gravitational interactions also."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "So that's the big problem everybody talks about."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "I mean, but it's also true that if you look at the standard model, it has these very, very deep, beautiful ideas, but there's certain aspects of it that are very, let's just say that they're not beautiful."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "There's very small number of parameters and a few integers which tell you what the theory is."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "To make this work as a theory of the real world, you need a Higgs field and you need to, it needs to do something."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "And once you introduce that Higgs field, all sorts of parameters make an appearance."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "So now we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are and what's gonna happen."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing with a couple of parameters to this thing, which the minute you put it in, you had to add all this extra, all these extra parameters to make things work."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And so that, it may be one argument as well, that's just the way the world is, and the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse and those numbers are just different in every universe."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "But another reasonable conjecture is just that, well, this is just telling us that there's something we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper way, which would explain those numbers."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And there's some kind of deeper idea about where the Higgs field comes from and what's going on, which we haven't figured out yet."},

theory, why it is something that deserved the effort that it got, and still, like if you think of it as a flame, still should be a little flame that keeps burning?"}, {"time": 3434, "text": "Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument for it is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics and about parts of physics really emerge from it."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "That was very a fruitful source of ideas."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And I think this is actually one argument you'll definitely, which I kind of agree with, I'll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists, say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea and it's led to so many other different things coming out of it that there must be something right about this."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And that's, okay, anyway, I think that's probably the strongest thing that they've got."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "But you don't think there's aspects to it that could be neighboring to a theory that does unify everything, to a theory of everything."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Like it could, it may not be exactly, exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer might get us closer to the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "Well, the problem with it now really is that you really don't know what it is now."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up with this nonperturbative theory."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "So it's become more and more frustrating and an odd activity to try to argue with a string theorist about string theory because it's become less and less well defined what it is."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And it's become actually more and more kind of a, whether you have this weird phenomenon of people calling themselves string theorists when they've never actually worked on any theory where there are any strings anywhere."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So what has actually happened kind of sociologically is that you started out with this fairly well defined proposal."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And then I would argue because that didn't work, people branched out in all sorts of directions doing all sorts of things."}, {"time": 3542,

that have now become this string theorists."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "And, but it's becoming almost more kind of a tribal denominator than a, I think so it's very hard to know what you're arguing about when you're arguing about string theory these days."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Well, to push back on that a little bit, I mean, string theory is just a term, right?"}, {"time": 3574, "text": "It doesn't, like you could, like this is the way language evolves is it could start to represent something more than just the theory that involves strings."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?"}, {"time": 3594, "text": "Or something like that."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "So for example, neural networks in the space of machine learning, there was a time when they were extremely popular."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "They became much, much less popular to a point where if you mentioned neural networks, you're getting no funding and you're not going to be respected at conferences."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "And then once again, neural networks became all the rage about 10, 15 years ago."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "And as it goes up and down and a lot of people would argue that using terminology like machine learning and deep learning is often misused over general, everything that works is deep learning, everything that doesn't, isn't something like that."},

the bathwater?"}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas from the Ed Wittons of the world, is there some core truths there that we should stick by in the full beautiful mess of a space that we call string theory, that people call string theory?"}, {"time": 3671, "text": "You're right, it is kind of a common problem that how what you call some field changes and evolves and in interesting ways as the field changes."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "But I mean, I guess what I would argue is the initial understanding of string theory that was quite specific, we're talking about a specific idea, 10 dimensional super strings compactified to six dimensions."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "That to my mind, the really bad thing has happened to the subject is that it's hard to get people to admit, at least publicly, that that was a failure, that this really didn't work."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that and they start doing more interesting things, but they keep talking to the public about string theory and referring back to that idea and using that as kind of the starting point and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts and everything else comes from."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So you're continually pointing back to this idea which never worked out as your guiding inspiration."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And it really kind of deforms your whole way of your hopes of making progress."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing that's happened in this field."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "Okay, sure, so there's a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity about communicating the things that failed in the past."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so you don't have a clear picture of like firm ground that you're standing on."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "But again, those are sociological things."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "And there's a bunch of questions I want to ask you."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "So one, what's your intuition about why the original idea failed?"}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So what can you say about why you're pretty sure it has failed?"}, {"time": 3812, "text": "I mean, the initial idea was, as I try to explain it, it was quite seductive in that you could see why Whitten and others got excited by it."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "It was, you know, at the time it looked like there were only a few of these possible clobby owls that would work."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand this very specific model and these very specific six dimensional spaces, and we're going to get everything."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just, you know, as people learned, worked more and more about it, it just didn't, they just kind of realized that there are just more and more things you can do with these six dimensions and you can't, and this is just not going to work."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Meaning like, it's, I mean, what was the failure mode here?"}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Is it, you could just have an infinite number of possibilities that you could do so you can come up with any theory you want, you can fit quantum mechanics, you can explain gravity, you can explain anything you want with it."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "Is that the basic failure mode?"}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea ended up being kind of being essentially empty, that it just doesn't, ends up not telling you anything because it's consistent with just about anything."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "And so, I mean, there's a complex, if you try and talk with string theorists about this now, I mean, there's an argument, there's a long argument over this about whether, oh no, no, no, maybe there still are constraints coming out of this idea or not."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "Or maybe we live in a multiverse and everything is true anyway, so you can, there are various ways you can kind of, that string theorists have kind of react to this kind of argument that I'm making, but I try to hold onto it."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "What about experimental validation?"}, {"time": 3918, "text": "Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory of everything that's trying to unify quantum mechanics and gravity?"}, {"time": 3928, "text": "Yeah, I mean, ultimately, to be really convinced that some new idea about unification really works, you need some kind of, you need to look at the real world and see that this is telling you something true about it."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "I mean, either telling you that if you do some experiment and go out and do it, you'll get some unexpected result and that's the kind of gold standard, or it may be just that like all those numbers that are, we don't know how to explain, it will show you how to calculate them."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation, but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "How tough is this, do you think, for a theory of everything, not just string theory, for something that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics, so the very big and the very small?"}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Is this, let me ask you one way, is it a physics problem, a math problem, or an engineering problem?"}, {"time": 3987, "text": "My guess is it's a combination of a physics and a math problem that you really need."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "It's not really engineering, it's not

all."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "But the question is, what mathematical tools you need to properly formulate the problem is unclear."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "So one reasonable conjecture is the way, the reason that we haven't had any success yet is just that we're missing, either we're missing certain physical ideas or we're missing certain mathematical tools, which there are some combination of them, which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem and see that it has a solution that looks like the real world."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "But those you need, I guess you don't, but there's a sense that you need both gravity, like all the laws of physics to be operating on the same level."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So it feels like you need an object like a black hole or something like that in order to make predictions about."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Otherwise, you're always making predictions about this joint phenomena or can you do that as long as the theory is consistent and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?"}, {"time": 4068, "text": "Well, your theory should, I mean, if your theory is gonna include gravity, our current understanding of gravity is that you should have, there should be black hole states in it."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "You should be able to describe black holes in this theory."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And just one aspect that people have concentrated a lot on is just this kind of questions about if your theory includes black holes like it's supposed to and it includes quantum mechanics, then there's certain kinds of paradoxes which come up."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And so that's been a huge focus of kind of quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "So stepping outside of string theory, can you just say first at a high level, what is the theory of everything?"}, {"time": 4108, "text": "What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?"}, {"time": 4112,

4122, "text": "It doesn't really, this kind of theory, this kind of theory of everything we're talking about doesn't say anything interesting, particularly about like macroscopic objects, about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow, or things are happening at this scale."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "But just what we've discovered is that as you look at the universe that kind of, if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart into, and you end up with some fairly simple pieces, quanta, if you like, and which are doing, which are interacting in some fairly simple way."}, {"time": 4154,

of cellular automata at the most fundamental level, you have to believe that everything that I've seen my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas, that that's all just kind of a mirage, which

terms of points of space and time, and you can reformulate in this Twister language."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And in this Twister language, it's the fundamental objects actually are more kind of the, are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "So maybe one way to say it, which actually I think is really, is quite amazing."}, {"time": 5222, "text":

sphere."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And that what you're looking at is you're looking at, a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "And what Penrose says is that, well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere, that sphere of all the light rays coming in."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "And he says, and you should formulate your, instead of thinking about points, you should think about the space of those spheres, if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom as physics as living on those spheres, living on, so you're kind of living on, your degrees

starting point."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "I don't know what is a good starting point for twister theory."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "Well, one thing you say about Penrose, I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer and also a very good draftsman."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "He's a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable, he actually has done some very nice drawings."}, {"time": 5483,

the, so spinners are something that independently came out of mathematics and out of physics."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "And to say where they came out of physics, I mean, what people realized when they started looking at elementary particles like electrons or whatever, that there seem to be some kind of doubling of the degrees of freedom going on."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "If you counted what was there in some sense in the way you would expect it and when you started doing quantum mechanics and started looking at elementary particles, there were seen to be two degrees of freedom, they're not one."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "And one way of seeing it was that if you put your electron in a strong magnetic field and asked what was the energy of it, instead of it having one energy, it would have two energies, there'd be two energy levels."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "And as you increase magnetic field, the splitting would increase."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "So we thought when we were doing, first started doing quantum mechanics, that the way to describe particles was in terms of wave functions and these

numbers?"}, {"time": 5575, "text": "Just weird."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "And then you can ask, well, what happens if you like take an electron and rotate it?"}, {"time": 5583, "text": "So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?"}, {"time": 5588, "text": "Well, now, if you go back to mathematics, what had been understood in mathematics, some years earlier, not that many years earlier, was that if you ask very, very generally, think about geometry of three dimensions and ask, and if you think about things that are happening in three dimensions in the standard way, everything, the standard way of doing geometry, everything is about vectors, right?"}, {"time": 5612, "text": "So if you've taken any mathematics classes, you probably see vectors at some point."},

changing or how you put two of them together and get planes and whatever."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "But what had been realized that, Rianna, is that if you ask very, very generally, what are the, if you have, what are the things that you can kind of consistently think about rotating?"}, {"time": 5653, "text": "And so you ask a technical question, what are the representations of the rotation group?"}, {"time": 5658, "text": "Well, you find that one answer is they're vectors and everything you build out of vectors, but then people found, but wait a minute, there's also these other things, which you can build out of vectors, but which you can consistently rotate."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "And they're described by pairs of complex numbers, by two complex numbers."}, {"time": 5678,

vectors out of spinners."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You can take two spinners and make a vector, but you can't, if you only have vectors, you can't get spinners."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "So they're in some sense, there's some kind of level of lower level of geometry beyond what we thought it was, which was kind of spinner geometry."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "And this is something which even to this day, when we teach graduate courses in geometry, we mostly don't talk about this because it's a bit hard to do correctly."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "If you start with your whole setup is in terms of vectors, describing things in terms of spinners is a whole different ball game."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "But anyway, it was just this amazing fact that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry, spinners, and what we were actually seeing, if you look at electron, are one and the same."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So it's, I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing, but it's very counterintuitive."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "What are some weird properties of spinners that are counterintuitive?"}, {"time": 5750, "text": "That there are some things that they do, for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees, it doesn't come back towards, it becomes minus what it was."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "Or, so it's, anyway, so the way rotations work, there's a kind of a funny sign you have to keep track of in some sense."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "So they're kind of too valued in another weird way."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "But the fundamental problem is that it's just not, if you're used to visualizing vectors, you just, there's nothing you can do visualizing in terms of vectors that will ever give you a spinner."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "It just is not gonna ever work."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector walking along a Mobius strip, and it ends up being upside down."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "But you're saying that doesn't really capture."}, {"time": 5794, "text": "So, I mean, what really captures it?"}, {"time": 5796, "text": "The problem is that it's really, the simplest way to describe it is in terms of two complex numbers."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "And your problem with two complex numbers is that's four real numbers."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional

can tell, no one had really looked at from this point of view before is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time in your quantum theory?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "And so there's another

one and to make it purely imaginary."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "And so all these formulas, which you have in your standard theory, if you do that to those, I mean, those formulas have some very

expected."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "And so that's the new thing that I have, or I think gives you something, is to do this move, which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical trick that

think that what they're being told by kind of some of the best institutions or a country or authorities is not true."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "You know, it's not true, it's a problem."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "That's obviously characteristic of not just physics, it's sociology."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics, it's the history of politics is you sell ideas to people, even when you don't have any proof that those ideas actually work in the US because if they've worked in that, that seems to be the case throughout history."}, {"time": 7403, "text": "And just like you said, it's human beings running up against a really hard problem."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "I'm not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory through the progress of physics that we're dealing with now or it's just a natural progress of science."}, {"time": 7420, "text": "You run up against a really difficult stage of a field and different people behave differently in the face of that."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "Some sell books and sort of tell narratives that are beautiful and so on."}, {"time": 7437, "text": "They're not necessarily grounded in solutions that have proven themselves."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "Others kind of put their head down quietly, keep doing the work."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "Others sort of pivot to different fields and that's kind of like, yeah, ants scattering."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And then you have fields like machine learning, which there was a few folks mostly scattered away from machine learning in the 90s, in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "But a few people kept their head down and now they're called the fathers of deep learning."}, {"time": 7467, "text": "And they didn't think of it that way."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "And in fact, if there's another AI winter, they'll just probably keep working on it anyway, sort of like loyal ants sticking to a particular thing."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying that we should be careful over hyping things that have not proven themselves because people will lose trust in the scientific process."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "But unfortunately, there's been other ways in which people have lost trust in the scientific process."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "That ultimately has to do actually with all the same kind of behavior as you're highlighting, which is not being honest and transparent about the flaws of mistakes of the past."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "But this particular field is kind of fun."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "It's always a strange one."}, {"time": 7517, "text": "I mean, I think in the sense that there's a lot of public fascination with it that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions about what is this physical reality?"}, {"time": 7527, "text": "Where do we come from?"}, {"time": 7528, "text": "And these kind of deep issues."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So there's this unusual fascination with it."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "Mathematics is very different."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "Nobody's that interested in mathematics."}, {"time": 7536, "text": "Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great, deep things about the world from mathematics that much."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "They don't ask mathematicians that."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "So it's a very unusual, it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "And it really is historically in a really unusual state."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "It's gotten itself way kind of down a blind alley in a way which it's hard to find other historical parallels to."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "But sort of to push back a little bit, there's power to inspiring people."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And if I just empirically look, physicists are really good at combining science and philosophy and communicating it."}, {"time": 7584, "text": "Like there's something about physics often that forces you to build a strong intuition about the way reality works, right?"}, {"time": 7591, "text": "And that allows you to think through sort of and communicate about all kinds of questions."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "Like if you see physicists, it's always fascinating to take on problems that have nothing to do with their particular discipline."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "They think in interesting ways and they're able to communicate their thinking in interesting ways."}, {"time": 7608, "text": "And so in some sense, they have a responsibility not just to do science, but to inspire."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "And not responsibility, but the opportunity."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "But I don't know, anyway, it's hard to say because there's many, many people doing this kind of thing with different degrees of success and whatever."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "Well, in general, for graduate students, for people who seek to be experts in the field, diversity of ideas is really powerful and is getting into this local pocket of ideas that people hold on to for several decades is not good, no matter what the idea."}, {"time": 7724, "text": "I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong, because there's no such thing as right in the long term, like it's right for now until somebody builds on something much bigger on top of it."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "It might end up being right, but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "So you always should question sort of the ways of the past."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "Yeah, so how to kind of achieve that kind of diversity of thought and within kind of the sociology of how we organize scientific researches."}, {"time": 7757, "text": "I know this is one thing that I think it's very interesting that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things to say about it."}, {"time": 7763, "text": "And I think also Lee Smolin in his book, which is also about that very much in agreement with them that there's a really kind of important questions about how research in this field is organized and what can you do to kind of get more diversity of thought and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "At the bottom, I think humility always helps."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "Well, the problem is that it's also, it's a combination of humility to know when you're wrong and also, but also you have to have a certain very serious lack of humility to believe that you're gonna make progress on some of these problems."}, {"time": 7811, "text": "I think you have to have like both modes and switch between them when needed."}, {"time": 7818, "text": "Let me ask you a question you're probably not gonna wanna answer because you're focused on the mathematics of things and mathematics can't answer the why questions, but let me ask you anyway."}, {"time": 7830, "text": "Do you think there's meaning to this whole thing?"}]}]
