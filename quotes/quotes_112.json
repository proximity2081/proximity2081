computer."}, {"time": 353, "text": "Is it possible with the advent of artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside of itself to see, to understand its creator?"}, {"time": 361, "text": "I mean, that's a simple, is that a ridiculous analogy?"}, {"time": 368, "text": "Well, I mean, with the computers that we actually have, I mean, first of all, we all know that humans have done an imperfect job of enforcing the abstraction boundaries of computers, right?"}, {"time": 383, "text": "Like you may try to confine some program to a playpen, but as soon as there's one memory allocation error in the C program, then the program has gotten out of that playpen and it can do whatever it wants, right?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "This is how most hacks work, you know, viruses and worms and exploits."}, {"time": 403, "text": "And, you know, you would have to imagine that an AI would be able to discover something like that."}, {"time": 409, "text": "Now, you know, of course, if we could actually discover some exploit of reality itself, then, you know, then this whole, I mean, then in some sense we wouldn't have to philosophize about this, right?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "This would no longer be a metaphysical conversation."}, {"time": 428, "text": "But the question is, what would that hack look like?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "Yeah, well, I have no idea."}, {"time": 428, "text": "I mean, Peter Shor, you know, the very famous person in quantum computing, of course, has joked that maybe the reason why we haven't yet, you know, integrated general relativity in quantum mechanics is that, you know, the part of the universe that depends on both of them was actually left unspecified."}, {"time": 456, "text": "And if we ever tried to do an experiment involving the singularity of a black hole or something like that, then, you know, the universe would just generate an overflow error or something, right?"}, {"time": 467, "text": "Yeah, we would just crash the universe."}, {"time": 467, "text": "Now, you know, the universe, you know, has seemed to hold up pretty well for, you know, 14 billion years, right?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "So, you know, my, you know, a Occam's razor kind of guess has to be that, you know, it will continue to hold up, you know, that the fact that we don't know the laws of physics governing some phenomenon is not a strong sign that probing that phenomenon is going to crash the universe, right?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "But, you know, of course, I could be wrong."}, {"time": 501, "text": "But do you think on the physics side of things, you know, there's been recently a few folks, Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram that came out with a theory of everything."}, {"time": 508, "text": "I think there's a history of physicists dreaming and working on the unification of all the laws of physics."}, {"time": 550, "text": "Well, I mean, to travel faster than our current spaceships could travel, you wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "The known laws of physics, you know, let us go much faster up to the speed of light, right?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "And, you know, when people want to go faster than the speed of light, well, we actually know something about what that would entail, namely that, you know, according to relativity, that seems to entail communication backwards in time."}, {"time": 570, "text": "Okay, so then you have to worry about closed time like curves and all of that stuff."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So, you know, in some sense, we sort of know the price that you have to pay for these things, right?"}, {"time": 585, "text": "But under the current understanding of physics."}, {"time": 588, "text": "We can't, you know, say that they're impossible, but we, you know, we know that sort of a lot else in physics breaks, right?"}, {"time": 593, "text": "So, now regarding Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram, like, I wouldn't say that either of them has a theory of everything."}, {"time": 601, "text": "I would say that they have ideas that they hope, you know, could someday lead to a theory of everything."}, {"time": 611, "text": "Is that a worthy pursuit?"}, {"time": 613, "text": "Well, I mean, certainly, let's say by theory of everything, you know, we don't literally mean a theory of cats and of baseball and, you know, but we just mean it in the more limited sense of everything, a fundamental theory of physics, right?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "Of all of the fundamental interactions of physics, of course, such a theory, even after we had it, you know, would leave the entire question of all the emergent behavior, right?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "You know, to be explored."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So, it's only everything for a specific definition of everything."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Okay, but in that sense, I would say, of course, that's worth pursuing."}, {"time": 650, "text": "I mean, that is the entire program of fundamental physics, right?"}, {"time": 650, "text": "All of my friends who do quantum gravity, who do string theory, who do anything like that, that is what's motivating them."}, {"time": 662, "text": "Yeah, it's funny, though, but, I mean, Eric Weinstein talks about this."}, {"time": 662, "text": "It is, I don't know much about the physics world, but I know about the AI world, and it is a little, it is a little bit taboo to talk about AGI, for example, on the AI side."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So, really, to talk about the big dream of the community, I would say, because it seems so far away, it's almost taboo to bring it up, because, you know, it's seen as the kind of people that dream about creating a truly superhuman level intelligence."}, {"time": 694, "text": "That's really far out there, people, because we're not even close to that."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And it feels like the same thing is true for the physics community."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I mean, Stephen Hawking certainly talked constantly about theory of everything, right?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "You know, I mean, people, you know, use those terms who were, you know, some of the most respected people in the whole world of physics, right?"}, {"time": 717, "text": "But, I mean, I think that the distinction that I would make is that people might react badly if you use the term in a way that suggests that you, you know, thinking about it for five minutes, have come up with this major new insight about it, right?"}, {"time": 729, "text": "Stephen Hawking is not a great example, because I think you can do whatever the heck you want when you get to that level."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And I certainly see, like, senior faculty, you know, that, you know, at that point, that's one of the nice things about getting older is you stop giving a damn."}, {"time": 749, "text": "But community as a whole, they tend to roll their eyes very quickly at stuff that's outside the quote unquote mainstream."}, {"time": 760, "text": "Well, let me put it this way."}, {"time": 787, "text": "Now, you know, whether people would call that a theory of everything, whether they would use that term, that might vary."}, {"time": 793, "text": "You know, Lenny Susskind would definitely have no problem telling you that, you know, if that's what we want, right?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "TK For me, who loves human beings and psychology, it's kind of ridiculous to say a theory that unifies the laws of physics gets you to understand everything."}, {"time": 813, "text": "I would say you're not even close to understanding everything."}, {"time": 816, "text": "TK Yeah, right."}, {"time": 816, "text": "I mean, the word everything is a little ambiguous here."}, {"time": 816, "text": "And then people will get into debates about, you know, reductionism versus emergentism and blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 823, "text": "And so in not wanting to say theory of everything, people might just be trying to short circuit that debate and say, you know, look, you know, yes, we want a fundamental theory of, you know, the particles and interactions of nature."}, {"time": 842, "text": "TK Let me bring up the next topic that people don't want to mention, although they're getting more comfortable with it, is consciousness."}, {"time": 845, "text": "You mentioned that you have a talk on consciousness that I watched five minutes of, but the internet connection was really bad."}, {"time": 853, "text": "TK Was this my talk about, you know, refuting the integrated information theory?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "TK Which was a particular account of consciousness that, yeah, I think one can just show it doesn't work."}, {"time": 862, "text": "Much harder to say what does work."}, {"time": 865, "text": "TK Let me ask, maybe it'd be nice to comment on, you talk about also like the semi hard problem of consciousness or like almost hard problem or kind of hard."}, {"time": 876, "text": "TK Pretty hard problem, I think I call it."}, {"time": 878, "text": "TK So maybe can you talk about that, their idea of the approach to modeling consciousness and why you don't find it convincing?"}, {"time": 887, "text": "What is it, first of all?"}, {"time": 889, "text": "TK Okay, well, so what I called the pretty hard problem of consciousness, this is my term, although many other people have said something equivalent to this, okay?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "But it's just, you know, the problem of, you know, giving an account of just which physical systems are conscious and which are not."}, {"time": 909, "text": "Or, you know, if there are degrees of consciousness, then quantifying how conscious a given system is."}, {"time": 916, "text": "TK Oh, awesome."}, {"time": 916, "text": "So that's the pretty hard problem."}, {"time": 919, "text": "TK Yeah, that's what I mean."}, {"time": 920, "text": "TK That's it."}, {"time": 920, "text": "I'm adopting it."}, {"time": 920, "text": "That's a good ring to it."}, {"time": 923, "text": "TK And so, you know, the infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain how something like consciousness could arise at all, you know, in a material universe, right?"}, {"time": 929, "text": "Or, you know, why does it ever feel like anything to experience anything, right?"}, {"time": 934, "text": "And, you know, so I'm trying to distinguish from that problem, right?"}, {"time": 940, "text": "And say, you know, no, okay, I would merely settle for an account that could say, you know, is a fetus conscious?"}, {"time": 946, "text": "You know, if so, at which trimester?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "You know, is a dog conscious?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "You know, what about a frog, right?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "TK Or even as a precondition, you take that both these things are conscious, tell me which is more conscious."}, {"time": 963, "text": "TK Yeah, for example, yes."}, {"time": 963, "text": "I mean, if consciousness is some multidimensional vector, well, just tell me in which respects these things are conscious and in which respect they aren't, right?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "I mean, this, this would be the kind of thing that we would need, you know, if we wanted to address questions, like, you know, what does it take for a machine to be conscious, right?"}, {"time": 1007, "text": "Or when are, you know, when should we regard AIs as being conscious?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So now this IIT, this integrated information theory, which has been put forward by Giulio Tinoni and a bunch of his collaborators over the last decade or two, this is noteworthy, I guess, as a direct attempt to answer that question, to, you know, answer the, to address the pretty hard problem, right?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "And they give a, a criterion that's just based on how a system is connected."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So you, so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system, like a brain or a microchip, as a collection of components that are connected to each other by some pattern of connections, you know, and, and to specify how the components can influence each other, you know, like where the inputs go, you know, where they affect the outputs."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "But then once you've specified that, then they give this quantity that they call phi, you know, the Greek letter phi."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And the definition of phi has actually changed over time."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "It changes from one paper to another, but in all of the variations, it involves something about what we in computer science would call graph expansion."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So basically what this means is that they want, in order to get a large value of phi, it should not be possible to take your system and partition it into two components that are only weakly connected to each other."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So whenever we take our system and sort of try to split it up into two, then there should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "Well, I understand what that means on a graph."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Do they formalize what, how to construct such a graph or data structure, whatever, or is this one of the criticism I've heard you kind of say is that a lot of the very interesting specifics are usually communicated through like natural language, like through words."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "So it's like the details aren't always clear."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Well, it's true."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "I mean, they have nothing even resembling a derivation of this phi."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So what they do is they state a whole bunch of postulates, you know, axioms that they think that consciousness should satisfy."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And then there's some verbal discussion."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "And then at some point, phi appears."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "And this, this was what the first thing that really made the hair stand on my neck, to be honest, because they are acting as if there is a derivation."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "They're acting as if, you know, you're supposed to think that this is a derivation and there's nothing even remotely resembling a derivate."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "They just pull the phi out of a hat completely."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Is one of the key criticisms to you is that details are missing or is there something more fundamental?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "That's not even the key criticism."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "That's just, that's just a side point."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "The, the core of it is that I think that the, you know, that they want to say that a system is more conscious the larger its value of phi."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And I think that that is obvious nonsense."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "As soon as you think about it for like a minute, as soon as you think about it in terms of, could I construct a system that had an enormous value of phi, like, you know, even larger than the brain has, but that is just implementing an error correcting code, you know, doing nothing that we would associate with, you know, intelligence or consciousness or any of it."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "The answer is yes, it is easy to do that."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And so I wrote blog posts, just making this point that, yeah, it's easy to do that."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Now, you know, Tinoni's response to that was actually kind of incredible, right?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "I mean, I, I, I admired it in a way because instead of disputing any of it, he just bit the bullet in the sense, you know, he was one of the, the, uh, the most, uh, uh, audacious bullet bitings I've ever seen in my career."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "He said, okay, then fine."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "You know, this system that just applies this error correcting code it's conscious, you know, and if it has a much larger value of phi than you or me, it's much more conscious than you and me."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "You know, you, we just have to accept what the theory says because, you know, science is not about confirming our intuitions."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It's about challenging them."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And, you know, this is what my theory predicts that this thing is conscious and, you know, or super duper conscious."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And how are you going to prove me wrong?"}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So the way I would argue against your blog posts is I would say, yes, sure."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "You're right in general, but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on earth, the, this rule of the larger fee being associated, being associated with more consciousness is correct."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So that's not what he said at all."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "Because he wants this to be completely general."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So we can apply to even computers."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I mean, I mean, the, the whole interest of the theory is the, you know, the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens, to computers, to animals, coma patients, to any of it."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And so, so, so he just said, well, you know, Scott is relying on his intuition, but, you know, I'm relying on this theory and, you know, to me it was almost like, you know, are we being serious here?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Like, like, like, you know, like, like, okay, yes, in science we try to learn highly nonintuitive things, but what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we already know the answer."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Like if we, if someone had a new theory of temperature, right, then, you know, maybe we could check that it says that boiling water is hotter than ice."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything, you know, you've ever experienced, then maybe we, we trust that extrapolation."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "But like this, this theory, like if, if, you know, it's now saying that, you know, a, a gigantic grit, like regular grid of exclusive or gates can be way more conscious than, you know, a person or than, than any animal can be, you know, even if it, you know, is, you know, is, is, is, is so uniform that it might as well just be a blank wall."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And, and so now the point is if, if this theory is sort of getting wrong, the question is a blank wall, you know, more conscious than a person, then I would say, what is, what is there for it to get right?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "So your, your sense is a blank wall is not more conscious than a human being."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "I mean, I mean, I mean, you could say that I am taking that as one of my axioms."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "I'm saying, I'm saying that if, if a theory of consciousness is, is getting that wrong, then whatever it is talking about at that point, I, I, I'm not going to call it consciousness."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "I'm going to use a different word."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "You have to use a different word."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "I mean, it's also, it's possible just like with intelligence that us humans conveniently define these very difficult to understand concepts in a very human centric way."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "Just like the Turing test really seems to define intelligence as a thing that's human like."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But I would say that with any, uh, concept, you know, there's, uh, uh, uh, you know, like we, we, we, we first need to define it."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "And a definition is only a good definition if it matches what we thought we were talking about prior to having a definition."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And I would say that, you know, uh, fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "That is my argument."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So let's take a further step."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So you mentioned that the universe might be a Turing machine."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So like it might be computations or simulatable by one anyway, simulated by one."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So what's your sense about consciousness?"}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Do you think consciousness is computation that we don't need to go to any place outside of the computable universe to, uh, you know, to, to understand consciousness, to build consciousness, to measure consciousness, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "These are what, uh, you know, have been called the, the vertiginous questions, right?"}, {"time": 1497, "text": "There's the questions like, like, uh, you know, you get a feeling of vertigo and thinking about them."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "I mean, I certainly feel like, uh, I am conscious in a way that is not reducible to computation, but why should you believe me?"}, {"time": 1514, "text": "I mean, and, and, and if you said the same to me, then why should I believe you?"}, {"time": 1519, "text": "But as computer scientists, I feel like a computer could be, could achieve human level intelligence, but, and that's actually a feeling and a hope."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "That's not a scientific belief."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "It's just, we've built up enough intuition, the same kind of intuition you use in your blog."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "You know, that's what scientists do."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "They, I mean, some of it is a scientific method, but some of it is just damn good intuition."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "I don't have a good intuition about consciousness."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I'm not sure that anyone does or has in the, you know, 2,500 years that these things have been discussed, Lex."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "But do you think we will?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Like one of the, I've gotten a chance to attend, can't wait to hear your opinion on this, but attend the Neuralink event."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And, uh, one of the dreams there is to, uh, you know, basically push neuroscience forward."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And the hope with neuroscience is that, uh, we can inspect the machinery from which all this fun stuff emerges and see, we're going to notice something special, some special sauce from which something like consciousness or cognition emerges."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Well, it's clear that we've learned an enormous amount about neuroscience."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "We've learned an enormous amount about computation, you know, about machine learning, about AI, how to get it to work."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "We've learned, uh, an enormous amount about the underpinnings of the physical world, you know, and, you know, from one point of view, that's like, uh, an enormous distance that we've traveled along the road to understanding consciousness."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "From another point of view, you know, the distance still to be traveled on the road, you know, maybe seems no shorter than it was at the beginning."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So it's very hard to say."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "I mean, you know, these are questions like, like in, in, in sort of trying to have a theory of consciousness, there's sort of a problem where it feels like it's not just that we don't know how to make progress."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "It's that it's hard to specify what could even count as progress, right?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "Because no matter what scientific theory someone proposed, someone else could come along and say, well, you've just talked about the mechanism."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "You haven't said anything about what breathes fire into the mechanism, what really makes there something that it's like to be it."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And that seems like an objection that you could always raise no matter, you know, how much someone elucidated the details of how the brain works."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "Let's go to the Turing test and the Lobner Prize."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "I have this intuition, call me crazy, but we, that a machine to pass the Turing test and it's full, whatever the spirit of it is, we can talk about how to formulate the perfect Turing test, that that machine has to be conscious."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "We at least have to, I have a very low bar of what consciousness is."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "I tend to, I tend to think that the emulation of consciousness is as good as consciousness."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So the consciousness is just a dance, a social, a social, a shortcut, like a nice, useful tool, but I tend to connect intelligence consciousness together."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "So by, by that, do you, maybe just to ask what, what role does consciousness play?"}, {"time": 1705, "text": "Do you think it passed in the Turing test?"}, {"time": 1705, "text": "Well, look, I mean, it's almost tautologically true that if we had a machine that passed the Turing test, then it would be emulating consciousness."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "So if your position is that, you know, emulation of consciousness is consciousness, then so, you know, by, by definition, any machine that passed the Turing test would be conscious."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But it's, but I mean, we know that you could say that, you know, that, that is just a way to rephrase the original question, you know, is an emulation of consciousness, you know, necessarily conscious."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And you can, can, you know, I hear, I'm not saying anything new that hasn't been debated ad nauseum in the literature."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "But, you know, you could imagine some very hard cases, like imagine a machine that passed the Turing test, but that did so just by an enormous cosmological sized lookup table that just cashed every possible conversation that could be had."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "The old Chinese room."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Well, well, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "But, but this is, I mean, I mean, the Chinese room actually would be doing some computation, at least in Searle's version."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Here, I'm just talking about a table lookup."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Now it's true that for conversations of a reasonable length, this, you know, lookup table would be so enormous that wouldn't even fit in the observable universe."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "But supposing that you could build a big enough lookup table and then just, you know, pass the Turing test just by looking up what the person said."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "Are you going to regard that as conscious?"}, {"time": 1792, "text": "Let me try to make this formal and then you can shut it down."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "I think that the emulation of something is that something, if there exists in that system, a black box that's full of mystery."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "So like, full of mystery to whom?"}, {"time": 1811, "text": "To human specters."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "So does that mean that consciousness is relative to the observer?"}, {"time": 1813, "text": "Like, could something be conscious for us, but not conscious for an alien that

conscious."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "To us, another way to phrase the black box is layers of abstraction, which make it very difficult to see to the actually underlying functionality of the system."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And then we observe just the abstraction."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And so it looks like magic to us."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "But once we understand the inner machinery, it stops being magic."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "And so like, that's a prerequisite is that you can't know how it works, or some part of it, because then there has to be in our human mind, entry point for the magic."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "So that's a formal definition of the system."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "Yeah, well, look, I mean, I explored a view in this essay I wrote called The Ghost in the Quantum Touring Machine seven years ago that is related to that, except that I did not want to have consciousness be relative to the observer, right?"}, {"time": 1877, "text":

conscious, nor do you need me to tell you that you are, right?"}, {"time": 1895, "text": "But basically, what I explored there is are there aspects of a system like a brain that just could not be predicted even with arbitrarily advanced future technologies?"}, {"time": 1907, "text": "It's because of chaos combined with quantum mechanical uncertainty and things like that."}, {"time": 1912,

that, you know, that version as convenient as it is for fiction writers, right?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "Let's just do the version where you put the prediction into a sealed envelope, okay?"},

to ask, you know, could such predictions be done, you know, even in principle, is it consistent with the laws of physics to make such predictions, to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate such predictions without having to kill them in the process to, you know, slice their brain up into little slivers or something."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I mean, it's theoretically possible, right?"}, {"time": 2039, "text": "I mean, it might be possible, but only at the cost of destroying the person, right?"}, {"time": 2044, "text": "I mean, it depends on how low you have to go in sort of the substrate."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Like if there was a nice digital abstraction layer, if you could think of each neuron as a kind of transistor computing a digital function, then

maybe there's no way to, you know, to make a deterministic prediction because, you know, we know that there's noise buffeting the brain around, presumably even quantum mechanical uncertainty, you know, affecting the sodium ion channels, for example, whether they open or they close."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "You know, there's no reason why over a certain time scale that shouldn't be amplified,

can't, you know, you're never going to be able to make an accurate enough copy."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "But now the hard part is, well, what if someone can make a copy that sort of no one else can tell apart from you, right?"}, {"time": 2148, "text": "It says the same kinds of things that you would have said, maybe not exactly the same things because we agree that there's noise, but it says the same kinds of things."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And maybe you alone would say, no, I know that that's not me, you know, it's, it doesn't share my, I haven't felt my consciousness leap over to that

he was even raising such, uh, audacious questions at all."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Uh, but you know, to, to, to answer your question, I think the first thing we need to get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to consciousness, right?"}, {"time": 2229, "text": "That would be like, um, you know, that would be tame compared to what he is saying, right?"},

quantum computer, I know that's still a computer, you know, in fact, a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "It might merely need exponentially more time in order to do so, right?"}, {"time": 2256, "text": "So that's simply not good enough for him."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "So what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computer

key point."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "That would be literally uncomputable."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "And I've asked him, you know, to clarify this, but uncomputable, even if you had an Oracle for

might be relevant at the big bang."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "They are plainly not relevant to something like the brain, you know, that is operating at ordinary temperatures, you know, with ordinary

already be the biggest development in physics for a century since quantum mechanics itself, okay?"}, {"time": 2531, "text": "He would need for consciousness to somehow be able to influence the

to go where Penrose goes."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "And the intuition he uses with the incompleteness theorem is that basically that there's important stuff that's not computable?"}, {"time": 2589,

consistency, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "And the, you know, the rejoinder to that, you know, from the very beginning has been, well, can we really?"}, {"time": 2715, "text": "I mean, maybe, you

that be a probability?"}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Then you take the squared absolute value of the result."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "That gives you a number between zero and one, okay?"}, {"time":

calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really, then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "All I need to do is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitudes that lead to that state."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum, but I can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the sum."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And hence the p, in the PSPACE?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Hence the PSPACE."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So what, out of that whole complexity zoo, and it could be BQP, what do you find is the most, the class that captured your heart the most, the most beautiful class that's just, yeah."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "I used, as my email address, bqpqpoly at

know, this is a class that I was involved in sort of defining, proving the first theorems about in 2003 or so."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "So it was kind of close to my heart."}, {"time": 5478, "text":

state, okay, that could somehow help you do computation."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "And maybe such a state would be exponentially hard to prepare, okay, but maybe somehow these states were formed in the Big Bang or something, and they've just been sitting around ever since, right?"}, {"time": 5506, "text": "If you found one, and if this state could be like ultra power, there are no limits on how

know, and that's BQP slash Qpoly."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "So that's one that I just personally happen to love, okay?"}, {"time": 5525, "text": "But, you know, if you're asking like what's the, you know, there's a class that I think is way more beautiful or fundamental than a lot of people even within this field realize that it is."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "That class is called SZK, or Statistical Zero Knowledge."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "And, you know, there's a very, very easy way to define this class, which is to say, suppose that I have two algorithms that each sample from probability distributions, right?"}, {"time": 5552, "text": "So each one just outputs random samples according to, you know, possibly different distributions."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And now the

far as close or far as probability distributions?"}, {"time": 5577, "text": "Any problem that can be reduced to that, you know, that can be put into that form is an SZK problem."}, {"time": 5584,

the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "Zero knowledge proofs are one of the central ideas in cryptography."}, {"time": 5601, "text":

very exhaustive enumeration of, you know, all the different permutations before you were convinced that it was true."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "But what if there were some all knowing wizard that said to you, look, I'll tell you what, just pick one of the graphs randomly, then randomly permute it, then send it to me and I will tell you which graph you started with."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And I will do that every single time."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And let's say that that wizard did that a hundred times and it was right every time."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "Now, if the graphs were isomorphic, then, you know, it would have been flipping a coin each time, right?"}, {"time": 5708, "text": "It would have had only a one and two to the 100 power chance of, you know, of guessing right each time."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "But, you know, so, so if it's right every time, then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs are not isomorphic, even though you've learned nothing
