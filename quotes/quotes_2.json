[{"title": "Rajat Monga: TensorFlow | Lex Fridman Podcast #22", "id": "NERNE4UThHU", "quotes": [{"time": 279, "text": "Yes, maybe Google's ahead of where everybody is, but there's a lot to do."}, {"time": 283, "text": "So a lot of this started to make sense and come together."}, {"time": 286, "text": "So the decision to open source, I was just chatting with Chris Glatner about this."}, {"time": 292, "text": "The decision to go open source with TensorFlow, I would say sort of for me personally, seems to be one of the big seminal moments in all of software engineering ever."}, {"time": 301, "text": "I think that's when a large company like Google decides to take a large project that many lawyers might argue has a lot of IP, just decide to go open source with it, and in so doing lead the entire world and saying, you know what, open innovation is a pretty powerful thing, and it's okay to do."}, {"time": 322, "text": "That was, I mean, that's an incredible moment in time."}, {"time": 326, "text": "So do you remember those discussions happening?"}, {"time": 329, "text": "Whether open source should be happening?"}, {"time": 332, "text": "I would say, I think, so the initial idea came from Jeff, who was a big proponent of this."}, {"time": 339, "text": "I think it came off of two big things."}, {"time": 342, "text": "One was research wise, we were a research group."}, {"time": 346, "text": "We were putting all our research out there."}, {"time": 349, "text": "If you wanted to, we were building on others research and we wanted to push the state of the art forward."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And part of that was to share the research."}, {"time": 356, "text": "That's how I think deep learning and machine learning has really grown so fast."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So the next step was, okay, now, would software help with that?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "And it seemed like they were existing a few libraries out there, Tiano being one, Torch being another, and a few others, but they were all done by academia and so the level was significantly different."}, {"time": 378, "text": "The other one was from a software perspective, Google had done lots of software or that we used internally, you know, and we published papers."}, {"time": 389, "text": "Often there was an open source project that came out of that that somebody else picked up that paper and implemented and they were very successful."}, {"time": 398, "text": "Back then it was like, okay, there's Hadoop, which has come off of tech that we've built."}, {"time": 404, "text": "We know the tech we've built is way better for a number of different reasons."}, {"time": 407, "text": "We've invested a lot of effort in that."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And turns out we have Google Cloud and we are now not really providing our tech, but we are saying, okay, we have Bigtable, which is the original thing."}, {"time": 422, "text": "We are going to now provide H base APIs on top of that, which isn't as good, but that's what everybody's used to."}, {"time": 427, "text": "So there's like, can we make something that is better and really just provide, helps the community in lots of ways, but also helps push a good standard forward."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So how does Cloud fit into that?"}, {"time": 439, "text": "There's a TensorFlow open source library and how does the fact that you can use so many of the resources that Google provides and the Cloud fit into that strategy?"}, {"time": 451, "text": "So TensorFlow itself is open and you can use it anywhere, right?"}, {"time": 454, "text": "And we want to make sure that continues to be the case."}, {"time": 458, "text": "On Google Cloud, we do make sure that there's lots of integrations with everything else and we want to make sure that it works really, really well there."}, {"time": 467, "text": "You're leading the TensorFlow effort."}, {"time": 470, "text": "Can you tell me the history and the timeline of TensorFlow project in terms of major design decisions, so like the open source decision, but really what to include and not?"}, {"time": 481, "text": "There's this incredible ecosystem that I'd like to talk about."}, {"time": 484, "text": "There's all these parts, but what if just some sample moments that defined what TensorFlow eventually became through its, I don't know if you're allowed to say history when it's just, but in deep learning, everything moves so fast and just a few years is already history."}, {"time": 503, "text": "Yes, yes, so looking back, we were building TensorFlow."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I guess we open sourced it in 2015, November 2015."}, {"time": 514, "text": "We started on it in summer of 2014, I guess."}, {"time": 519, "text": "And somewhere like three to six, late 2014, by then we had decided that, okay, there's a high likelihood we'll open source it."}, {"time": 527, "text": "So we started thinking about that and making sure we're heading down that path."}, {"time": 533, "text": "At that point, by that point, we had seen a few, lots of different use cases at Google."}, {"time": 539, "text": "So there were things like, okay, yes, you wanna run it at large scale in the data center."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Yes, we need to support different kind of hardware."}, {"time": 547, "text": "We had GPUs at that point."}, {"time": 549, "text": "We had our first GPU at that point or was about to come out roughly around that time."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So the design sort of included those."}, {"time": 558, "text": "We had started to push on mobile."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So we were running models on mobile."}, {"time": 564, "text": "At that point, people were customizing code."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So we wanted to make sure TensorFlow could support that as well."}, {"time": 570, "text": "So that sort of became part of that overall design."}, {"time": 575, "text": "When you say mobile, you mean like a pretty complicated algorithms running on the phone?"}, {"time": 580, "text": "So when you have a model that you deploy on the phone and run it there, right?"}, {"time": 585, "text": "So already at that time, there was ideas of running machine learning on the phone."}, {"time": 589, "text": "We already had a couple of products that were doing that by then."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And in those cases, we had basically customized handcrafted code or some internal libraries that we're using."}, {"time": 600, "text": "So I was actually at Google during this time in a parallel, I guess, universe, but we were using Theano and Caffe."}, {"time": 609, "text": "Was there some degree to which you were bouncing, like trying to see what Caffe was offering people, trying to see what Theano was offering that you want to make sure you're delivering on whatever that is?"}, {"time": 621, "text": "Perhaps the Python part of thing, maybe did that influence any design decisions?"}, {"time": 628, "text": "So when we built this belief and some of that was in parallel with some of these libraries coming up, I mean, Theano itself is older, but we were building this belief focused on our internal thing because our systems were very different."}, {"time": 642, "text": "By the time we got to this, we looked at a number of libraries that were out there."}, {"time": 647, "text": "Theano, there were folks in the group who had experience with Torch, with Lua."}, {"time": 652, "text": "There were folks here who had seen Caffe."}, {"time": 654, "text": "I mean, actually, Yang Jing was here as well."}, {"time": 658, "text": "There's what other libraries?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "I think we looked at a number of things."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Might even have looked at JNR back then."}, {"time": 666, "text": "I'm trying to remember if it was there."}, {"time": 669, "text": "In fact, yeah, we did discuss ideas around, okay, should we have a graph or not?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "So putting all these together was definitely, they were key decisions that we wanted."}, {"time": 682, "text": "We had seen limitations in our prior disbelief things."}, {"time": 688, "text": "A few of them were just in terms of research was moving so fast, we wanted the flexibility."}, {"time": 695, "text": "The hardware was changing fast."}, {"time": 696, "text": "We expected to change that so that those probably were two things."}, {"time": 699, "text": "And yeah, I think the flexibility in terms of being able to express all kinds of crazy things was definitely a big one then."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So what, the graph decisions though, with moving towards TensorFlow 2.0, there's more, by default, there'll be eager execution."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So sort of hiding the graph a little bit because it's less intuitive in terms of the way people develop and so on."}, {"time": 723, "text": "What was that discussion like in terms of using graphs?"}, {"time": 726, "text": "It seemed, it's kind of the Theano way."}, {"time": 729, "text": "Did it seem the obvious choice?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "So I think where it came from was our disbelief had a graph like thing as well."}, {"time": 737, "text": "A much more simple, it wasn't a general graph, it was more like a straight line thing."}, {"time": 743, "text": "More like what you might think of cafe, I guess in that sense."}, {"time": 746, "text": "But the graph was, and we always cared about the production stuff."}, {"time": 751, "text": "Like even with disbelief, we were deploying a whole bunch of stuff in production."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So graph did come from that when we thought of, okay, should we do that in Python?"}, {"time": 759, "text": "And we experimented with some ideas where it looked a lot simpler to use, but not having a graph meant, okay, how do you deploy now?"}, {"time": 767, "text": "So that was probably what tilted the balance for us and eventually we ended up with a graph."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And I guess the question there is, did you, I mean, so production seems to be the really good thing to focus on, but did you even anticipate the other side of it where there could be, what is it?"}, {"time": 784, "text": "What are the numbers?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "It's been crazy, 41 million downloads."}, {"time": 792, "text": "I mean, was that even like a possibility in your mind that it would be as popular as it became?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "So I think we did see a need for this a lot from the research perspective and like early days of deep learning in some ways."}, {"time": 812, "text": "41 million, no, I don't think I imagined this number."}, {"time": 815, "text": "Then it seemed like there's a potential future where lots more people would be doing this and how do we enable that?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "I would say this kind of growth, I probably started seeing somewhat after the open sourcing where it was like, okay, deep learning is actually growing way faster for a lot of different reasons."}, {"time": 839, "text": "And we are in just the right place to push on that and leverage that and deliver on lots of things that people want."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So what changed once you open sourced?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "Like how this incredible amount of attention from a global population of developers, how did the project start changing?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "I don't even actually remember during those times."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I know looking now, there's really good documentation, there's an ecosystem of tools, there's a community, there's a blog, there's a YouTube channel now, right?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "It's very community driven."}, {"time": 873, "text": "Back then, I guess 0.1 version, is that the version?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "I think we call it 0.6 or five, something like that, I forget."}, {"time": 883, "text": "What changed leading into 1.0?"}, {"time": 888, "text": "I think we've gone through a few things there."}, {"time": 891, "text": "When we started out, when we first came out, people loved the documentation we have because it was just a huge step up from everything else because all of those were academic projects, people doing, who don't think about documentation."}, {"time": 904, "text": "I think what that changed was, instead of deep learning being a research thing, some people who were just developers could now suddenly take this out and do some interesting things with it, right?"}, {"time": 916, "text": "Who had no clue what machine learning was before then."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And that I think really changed how things started to scale up in some ways and pushed on it."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Over the next few months as we looked at how do we stabilize things, as we look at not just researchers, now we want stability, people want to deploy things."}, {"time": 936, "text": "That's how we started planning for 1.0 and there are certain needs for that perspective."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And so again, documentation comes up, designs, more kinds of things to put that together."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And so that was exciting to get that to a stage where more and more enterprises wanted to buy in and really get behind that."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And I think post 1.0 and over the next few releases, that enterprise adoption also started to take off."}, {"time": 964, "text": "I would say between the initial release and 1.0, it was, okay, researchers of course, then a lot of hobbies and early interest, people excited about this who started to get on board and then over the 1.x thing, lots of enterprises."}, {"time": 978, "text": "I imagine anything that's below 1.0 gives pressure to be, the enterprise probably wants something that's stable."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And do you have a sense now that TensorFlow is stable?"}, {"time": 993, "text": "Like it feels like deep learning in general is extremely dynamic field, so much is changing."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And TensorFlow has been growing incredibly."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Do you have a sense of stability at the helm of it?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "I mean, I know you're in the midst of it, but."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Yeah, I think in the midst of it, it's often easy to forget what an enterprise wants and what some of the people on that side want."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "There are still people running models that are three years old, four years old."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So Inception is still used by tons of people."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Even ResNet 50 is what, couple of years old now or more, but there are tons of people who use that and they're fine."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "They don't need the last couple of bits of performance or quality, they want some stability in things that just work."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And so there is value in providing that with that kind of stability and making it really simpler because that allows a lot more people to access it."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And then there's the research crowd which wants, okay, they wanna do these crazy things exactly like you're saying, right?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Not just deep learning in the straight up models that used to be there, they want RNNs and even RNNs are maybe old, they are transformers now."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And now it needs to combine with RL and GANs and so on."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So there's definitely that area that like the boundary that's shifting and pushing the state of the art."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "But I think there's more and more of the past that's much more stable and even stuff that was two, three years old is very, very usable by lots of people."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So that part makes it a lot easier."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So I imagine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, one of the biggest use cases is essentially taking something like ResNet 50 and doing some kind of transfer learning on a very particular problem that you have."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "It's basically probably what majority of the world does."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And you wanna make that as easy as possible."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So I would say for the hobbyist perspective, that's the most common case, right?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "In fact, the apps and phones and stuff that you'll see, the early ones, that's the most common case."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "I would say there are a couple of reasons for that."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "One is that everybody talks about that."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "It looks great on slides."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "That's a presentation, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "What enterprises want is that is part of it, but that's not the big thing."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "Enterprises really have data that they wanna make predictions on."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "This is often what they used to do with the people who were doing ML was just regression models, linear regression, logistic regression, linear models, or maybe gradient booster trees and so on."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Some of them still benefit from deep learning, but they want that's the bread and butter, or like the structured data and so on."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So depending on the audience you look at, they're a little bit different."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "And they just have, I mean, the best of enterprise probably just has a very large data set, or deep learning can probably shine."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "That's correct, that's right."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And then I think the other pieces that they wanted, again, with 2.0, the developer summit we put together is the whole TensorFlow Extended piece, which is the entire pipeline."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "They care about stability across doing their entire thing."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "They want simplicity across the entire thing."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I don't need to just train a model."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I need to do that every day again, over and over again."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "I wonder to which degree you have a role in, I don't know, so I teach a course on deep learning."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "I have people like lawyers come up to me and say, when is machine learning gonna enter legal, the legal realm?"}, {"time": 1205, "text": "The same thing in all kinds of disciplines, immigration, insurance, often when I see what it boils down to is these companies are often a little bit old school in the way they organize the data."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So the data is just not ready yet, it's not digitized."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Do you also find yourself being in the role of an evangelist for like, let's get, organize your data, folks, and then you'll get the big benefit of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Do you get those, have those conversations?"}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Yeah, yeah, you know, I get all kinds of questions there from, okay, what do I need to make this work, right?"}, {"time": 1249, "text": "Do we really need deep learning?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "I mean, there are all these things, I already use this linear model, why would this help?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "I don't have enough data, let's say, or I wanna use machine learning, but I have no clue where to start."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So it varies, that to all the way to the experts to why support very specific things, it's interesting."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Is there a good answer?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "It boils down to oftentimes digitizing data."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So whatever you want automated, whatever data you want to make prediction based on, you have to make sure that it's in an organized form."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Like within the TensorFlow ecosystem, there's now, you're providing more and more data sets and more and more pre trained models."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Are you finding yourself also the organizer of data sets?"}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Yes, I think the TensorFlow data sets that we just released, that's definitely come up where people want these data sets, can we organize them and can we make that easier?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So that's definitely one important thing."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "The other related thing I would say is I often tell people, you know what, don't think of the most fanciest thing that the newest model that you see, make something very basic work and then you can improve it."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "There's just lots of things you can do with it."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Yeah, start with the basics, true."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "One of the big things that makes TensorFlow even more accessible was the appearance whenever that happened of Keras, the Keras standard sort of outside of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I think it was Keras on top of Tiano at first only and then Keras became on top of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Do you know when Keras chose to also add TensorFlow as a backend, who was the, was it just the community that drove that initially?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Do you know if there was discussions, conversations?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "Yeah, so Francois started the Keras project before he was at Google and the first thing was Tiano."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I don't remember if that was after TensorFlow was created or way before."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And then at some point, when TensorFlow started becoming popular, there were enough similarities that he decided to create this interface and put TensorFlow as a backend."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "I believe that might still have been before he joined Google."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So we weren't really talking about that."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "He decided on his own and thought that was interesting and relevant to the community."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "In fact, I didn't find out about him being at Google until a few months after he was here."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "He was working on some research ideas and doing Keras on his nights and weekends project."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "He wasn't like part of the TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "He didn't join initially."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "He joined research and he was doing some amazing research."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "He has some papers on that and research, so he's a great researcher as well."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And at some point we realized, oh, he's doing this good stuff."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "People seem to like the API and he's right here."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So we talked to him and he said, okay, why don't I come over to your team and work with you for a quarter and let's make that integration happen."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And we talked to his manager and he said, sure, quarter's fine."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And that quarter's been something like two years now."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And so he's fully on this."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So Keras got integrated into TensorFlow in a deep way."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And now with 2.0, TensorFlow 2.0, sort of Keras is kind of the recommended way for a beginner to interact with TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Which makes that initial sort of transfer learning or the basic use cases, even for an enterprise, super simple, right?"}, {"time": 1472, "text": "That seems like it's kind of a bold decision as well."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "We did spend a lot of time thinking about that one."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "We had a bunch of APIs, some built by us."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "There was a parallel layers API that we were building."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And when we decided to do Keras in parallel, so there were like, okay, two things that we are looking at."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And the first thing we was trying to do is just have them look similar, like be as integrated as possible, share all of that stuff."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "There were also like three other APIs that others had built over time because we didn't have a standard one."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "But one of the messages that we kept hearing from the community, okay, which one do we use?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And they kept seeing like, okay, here's a model in this one and here's a model in this one, which should I pick?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So that's sort of like, okay, we had to address that straight on with 2.0."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "The whole idea was we need to simplify."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "We had to pick one."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Based on where we were, we were like, okay, let's see what are the people like?"}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And Keras was clearly one that lots of people loved."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "There were lots of great things about it."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So we settled on that."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Organically, that's kind of the best way to do it."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "It was great."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "It was surprising, nevertheless, to sort of bring in an outside."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "I mean, there was a feeling like Keras might be almost like a competitor in a certain kind of, to TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And in a sense, it became an empowering element of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting how you can put two things together, which can align."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "In this case, I think Francois, the team, and a bunch of us have chatted, and I think we all want to see the same kind of things."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "We all care about making it easier for the huge set of developers out there, and that makes a difference."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So Python has Guido van Rossum, who until recently held the position of benevolent dictator for life."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "All right, so there's a huge successful open source project like TensorFlow need one person who makes a final decision."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So you've did a pretty successful TensorFlow Dev Summit just now, last couple of days."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "There's clearly a lot of different new features being incorporated, an amazing ecosystem, so on."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Who's, how are those design decisions made?"}, {"time": 1617, "text": "Is there a BDFL in TensorFlow, or is it more distributed and organic?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "I think it's somewhat different, I would say."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "I've always been involved in the key design directions, but there are lots of things that are distributed where there are a number of people, Martin Wick being one, who has really driven a lot of our open source stuff, a lot of the APIs, and there are a number of other people who've been, you know, pushed and been responsible for different parts of it."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "We do have regular design reviews."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Over the last year, we've had a lot of we've really spent a lot of time opening up to the community and adding transparency."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "We're setting more processes in place, so RFCs, special interest groups, to really grow that community and scale that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I think the kind of scale that ecosystem is in, I don't think we could scale with having me as the lone point of decision maker."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "So, yeah, the growth of that ecosystem, maybe you can talk about it a little bit."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "First of all, it started with Andrej Karpathy when he first did ComNetJS."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "The fact that you can train and you'll network in the browser was, in JavaScript, was incredible."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So now TensorFlow.js is really making that a serious, like a legit thing, a way to operate, whether it's in the backend or the front end."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Then there's the TensorFlow Extended, like you mentioned."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "There's TensorFlow Lite for mobile."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And all of it, as far as I can tell, it's really converging towards being able to save models in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "You can move around, you can train on the desktop and then move it to mobile and so on."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "So there's that cohesiveness."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So can you maybe give me, whatever I missed, a bigger overview of the mission of the ecosystem that's trying to be built and where is it moving forward?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in short, the way I like to think of this is our goals to enable machine learning."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "And in a couple of ways, you know, one is we have lots of exciting things going on in ML today."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "We started with deep learning, but we now support a bunch of other algorithms too."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "So one is to, on the research side, keep pushing on the state of the art."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Can we, you know, how do we enable researchers to build the next amazing thing?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So BERT came out recently, you know, it's great that people are able to do new kinds of research."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And there are lots of amazing research that happens across the world."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So that's one direction."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "The other is how do you take that across all the people outside who want to take that research and do some great things with it and integrate it to build real products, to have a real impact on people."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And so if that's the other axes in some ways, you know, at a high level, one way I think about it is there are a crazy number of compute devices across the world."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "And we often used to think of ML and training and all of this as, okay, something you do either in the workstation or the data center or cloud."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "But we see things running on the phones."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "We see things running on really tiny chips."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "I mean, we had some demos at the developer summit."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "And so the way I think about this ecosystem is how do we help get machine learning on every device that has a compute capability?"}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And that continues to grow and so in some ways this ecosystem is looked at, you know, various aspects of that and grown over time to cover more of those."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "And we continue to push the boundaries."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "In some areas we've built more tooling and things around that to help you."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "I mean, the first tool we started was TensorBoard."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "You wanted to learn just the training piece, the effects or TensorFlow extended to really do your entire ML pipelines."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "If you're, you know, care about all that production stuff, but then going to the edge, going to different kinds of things."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "And it's not just us now."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "We are a place where there are lots of libraries being built on top."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So there are some for research, maybe things like TensorFlow agents or TensorFlow probability that started as research things or for researchers for focusing on certain kinds of algorithms, but they're also being deployed or used by, you know, production folks."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "And some have come from within Google, just teams across Google who wanted to build these things."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Others have come from just the community because there are different pieces that different parts of the community care about."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And I see our goal as enabling even that, right?"}, {"time": 1909, "text": "It's not, we cannot and won't build every single thing."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "That just doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "But if we can enable others to build the things that they care about, and there's a broader community that cares about that, and we can help encourage that, and that's great."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "That really helps the entire ecosystem, not just those."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "One of the big things about 2.0 that we're pushing on is, okay, we have these so many different pieces, right?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "How do we help make all of them work well together?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So there are a few key pieces there that we're pushing on, one being the core format in there and how we share the models themselves through save model and TensorFlow hub and so on."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And a few of the pieces that we really put this together."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I was very skeptical that that's, you know, when TensorFlow.js came out, it didn't seem, or deep learning JS as it was earlier."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Yeah, that was the first."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "It seems like technically very difficult project."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "As a standalone, it's not as difficult, but as a thing that integrates into the ecosystem, it seems very difficult."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So, I mean, there's a lot of aspects of this you're making look easy, but, and the technical side, how many challenges have to be overcome here?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And still have to be overcome."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "That's the question here too."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "There are lots of steps to it, right?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And we've iterated over the last few years, so there's a lot we've learned."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I, yeah, and often when things come together well, things look easy and that's exactly the point."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "It should be easy for the end user, but there are lots of things that go behind that."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "If I think about still challenges ahead, there are, you know, we have a lot more devices coming on board, for example, from the hardware perspective."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "How do we make it really easy for these vendors to integrate with something like TensorFlow, right?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "So there's a lot of compiler stuff that others are working on."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "There are things we can do in terms of our APIs and so on that we can do."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "As we, you know, TensorFlow started as a very monolithic system and to some extent it still is."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "There are less, lots of tools around it, but the core is still pretty large and monolithic."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "One of the key challenges for us to scale that out is how do we break that apart with clearer interfaces?"}, {"time": 2050, "text": "It's, you know, in some ways it's software engineering 101, but for a system that's now four years old, I guess, or more, and that's still rapidly evolving and that we're not slowing down with, it's hard to change and modify and really break apart."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "It's sort of like, as people say, right, it's like changing the engine with a car running or trying to fix that."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "That's exactly what we're trying to do."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So there's a challenge here because the downside of so many people being excited about TensorFlow and coming to rely on it in many of their applications is that you're kind of responsible, like it's the technical debt."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "You're responsible for previous versions to some degree still working."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "So when you're trying to innovate, I mean, it's probably easier to just start from scratch every few months."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "So do you feel the pain of that?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "2.0 does break some back compatibility, but not too much."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "It seems like the conversion is pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "Do you think that's still important given how quickly deep learning is changing?"}, {"time": 2122, "text": "Can you just, the things that you've learned, can you just start over or is there pressure to not?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "It's a tricky balance."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So if it was just a researcher writing a paper who a year later will not look at that code again, sure, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "There are a lot of production systems that rely on TensorFlow, both at Google and across the world."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And people worry about this."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "I mean, these systems run for a long time."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So it is important to keep that compatibility and so on."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "And yes, it does come with a huge cost."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "There's, we have to think about a lot of things as we do new things and make new changes."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "I think it's a trade off, right?"}, {"time": 2169, "text": "You can, you might slow certain kinds of things down, but the overall value you're bringing because of that is much bigger because it's not just about breaking the person yesterday."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "It's also about telling the person tomorrow that, you know what, this is how we do things."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "We're not gonna break you when you come on board because there are lots of new people who are also gonna come on board."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And, you know, one way I like to think about this, and I always push the team to think about it as well, when you wanna do new things, you wanna start with a clean slate."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Design with a clean slate in mind, and then we'll figure out how to make sure all the other things work."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And yes, we do make compromises occasionally, but unless you design with the clean slate and not worry about that, you'll never get to a good place."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Oh, that's brilliant, so even if you are responsible when you're in the idea stage, when you're thinking of new, just put all that behind you."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Okay, that's really, really well put."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So I have to ask this because a lot of students, developers ask me how I feel about PyTorch versus TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So I've recently completely switched my research group to TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "I wish everybody would just use the same thing, and TensorFlow is as close to that, I believe, as we have."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But do you enjoy competition?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So TensorFlow is leading in many ways, on many dimensions in terms of ecosystem, in terms of number of users, momentum, power, production levels, so on, but a lot of researchers are now also using PyTorch."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "Do you enjoy that kind of competition or do you just ignore it and focus on making TensorFlow the best that it can be?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So just like research or anything people are doing, it's great to get different kinds of ideas."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And when we started with TensorFlow, like I was saying earlier, one, it was very important for us to also have production in mind."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "We didn't want just research, right?"}, {"time": 2289, "text": "And that's why we chose certain things."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "Now PyTorch came along and said, you know what, I only care about research."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "This is what I'm trying to do."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "What's the best thing I can do for this?"}, {"time": 2298, "text": "And it started iterating and said, okay, I don't need to worry about graphs."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "Let me just run things."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And I don't care if it's not as fast as it can be, but let me just make this part easy."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "And there are things you can learn from that, right?"}, {"time": 2312, "text": "They, again, had the benefit of seeing what had come before, but also exploring certain different kinds of spaces."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "And they had some good things there, building on say things like JNR and so on before that."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So competition is definitely interesting."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "It made us, you know, this is an area that we had thought about, like I said, way early on."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "Over time we had revisited this a couple of times, should we add this again?"}, {"time": 2339, "text": "At some point we said, you know what, it seems like this can be done well, so let's try it again."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And that's how we started pushing on eager execution."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "How do we combine those two together?"}, {"time": 2349, "text": "Which has finally come very well together in 2.0, but it took us a while to get all the things together and so on."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So let me ask, put another way, I think eager execution is a really powerful thing that was added."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Do you think it wouldn't have been, you know, Muhammad Ali versus Frasier, right?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "Do you think it wouldn't have been added as quickly if PyTorch wasn't there?"}, {"time": 2373, "text": "It might have taken longer."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "No longer?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "Yeah, it was, I mean, we had tried some variants of that before, so I'm sure it would have happened, but it might have taken longer."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "I'm grateful that TensorFlow is finally in the way they did."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "It's doing some incredible work last couple years."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "What other things that we didn't talk about are you looking forward in 2.0?"}, {"time": 2391, "text": "That comes to mind."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "So we talked about some of the ecosystem stuff, making it easily accessible to Keras, eager execution."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Is there other things that we missed?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Yeah, so I would say one is just where 2.0 is, and you know, with all the things that we've talked about, I think as we think beyond that, there are lots of other things that it enables us to do and that we're excited about."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So what it's setting us up for, okay, here are these really clean APIs."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "We've cleaned up the surface for what the users want."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "What it also allows us to do a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes once we are ready with 2.0."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "So for example, in TensorFlow with graphs and all the things you could do, you could always get a lot of good performance if you spent the time to tune it, right?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "And we've clearly shown that, lots of people do that."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "With 2.0, with these APIs, where we are, we can give you a lot of performance just with whatever you do."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "You know, because we see these, it's much cleaner."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "We know most people are gonna do things this way."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "We can really optimize for that and get a lot of those things out of the box."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "And it really allows us, you know, both for single machine and distributed and so on, to really explore other spaces behind the scenes after 2.0 in the future versions as well."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "So right now the team's really excited about that, that over time I think we'll see that."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "The other piece that I was talking about in terms of just restructuring the monolithic thing into more pieces and making it more modular, I think that's gonna be really important for a lot of the other people in the ecosystem, other organizations and so on that wanted to build things."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "Can you elaborate a little bit what you mean by making TensorFlow ecosystem more modular?"}, {"time": 2510, "text": "So the way it's organized today is there's one, there are lots of repositories in the TensorFlow organization at GitHub."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "The core one where we have TensorFlow, it has the execution engine, it has the key backends for CPUs and GPUs, it has the work to do distributed stuff."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And all of these just work together in a single library or binary."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "There's no way to split them apart easily."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "I mean, there are some interfaces, but they're not very clean."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "In a perfect world, you would have clean interfaces where, okay, I wanna run it on my fancy cluster with some custom networking, just implement this and do that."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "I mean, we kind of support that, but it's hard for people today."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "I think as we are starting to see more interesting things in some of these spaces, having that clean separation will really start to help."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And again, going to the large size of the ecosystem and the different groups involved there, enabling people to evolve and push on things more independently just allows it to scale better."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And by people, you mean individual developers and?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So the hope is that everybody sort of major, I don't know, Pepsi or something uses, like major corporations go to TensorFlow to this kind of."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Yeah, if you look at enterprises like Pepsi or these, I mean, a lot of them are already using TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "They are not the ones that do the development or changes in the core."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "Some of them do, but a lot of them don't."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "I mean, they touch small pieces."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "There are lots of these, some of them being, let's say, hardware vendors who are building their custom hardware and they want their own pieces."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "Or some of them being bigger companies, say, IBM."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I mean, they're involved in some of our special interest groups, and they see a lot of users who want certain things and they want to optimize for that."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "So folks like that often."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Autonomous vehicle companies, perhaps."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "So, yeah, like I mentioned, TensorFlow has been downloaded 41 million times, 50,000 commits, almost 10,000 pull requests, and 1,800 contributors."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "So I'm not sure if you can explain it, but what does it take to build a community like that?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "In retrospect, what do you think, what is the critical thing that allowed for this growth to happen, and how does that growth continue?"}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Yeah, yeah, that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "I wish I had all the answers there, I guess, so you could replicate it."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "I think there are a number of things that need to come together, right?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "One, just like any new thing, it is about, there's a sweet spot of timing, what's needed, does it grow with, what's needed, so in this case, for example, TensorFlow's not just grown because it was a good tool, it's also grown with the growth of deep learning itself."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "So those factors come into play."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "Other than that, though, I think just hearing, listening to the community, what they do, what they need, being open to, like in terms of external contributions, we've spent a lot of time in making sure we can accept those contributions well, we can help the contributors in adding those, putting the right process in place, getting the right kind of community, welcoming them and so on."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Like over the last year, we've really pushed on transparency, that's important for an open source project."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "People wanna know where things are going, and we're like, okay, here's a process where you can do that, here are our RFCs and so on."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So thinking through, there are lots of community aspects that come into that you can really work on."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "As a small project, it's maybe easy to do because there's like two developers and you can do those."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "As you grow, putting more of these processes in place, thinking about the documentation, thinking about what two developers care about, what kind of tools would they want to use, all of these come into play, I think."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "So one of the big things I think that feeds the TensorFlow fire is people building something on TensorFlow, and implement a particular architecture that does something cool and useful, and they put that on GitHub."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And so it just feeds this growth."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "Do you have a sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there may be a little bit of a partitioning like there is with Python 2 and 3, that there'll be a code base and in the older versions of TensorFlow, they will not be as compatible easily?"}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Or are you pretty confident that this kind of conversion is pretty natural and easy to do?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So we're definitely working hard to make that very easy to do."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "There's lots of tooling that we talked about at the developer summit this week, and we'll continue to invest in that tooling."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "It's, you know, when you think of these significant version changes, that's always a risk, and we are really pushing hard to make that transition very, very smooth."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So I think, so at some level, people wanna move and they see the value in the new thing."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "They don't wanna move just because it's a new thing, and some people do, but most people want a really good thing."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "And I think over the next few months, as people start to see the value, we'll definitely see that shift happening."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So I'm pretty excited and confident that we will see people moving."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "As you said earlier, this field is also moving rapidly, so that'll help because we can do more things and all the new things will clearly happen in 2.x, so people will have lots of good reasons to move."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So what do you think TensorFlow 3.0 looks like?"}, {"time": 2856, "text": "Is there, are things happening so crazily that even at the end of this year seems impossible to plan for?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Or is it possible to plan for the next five years?"}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I think it's tricky."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "There are some things that we can expect in terms of, okay, change, yes, change is gonna happen."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "Are there some things gonna stick around and some things not gonna stick around?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "I would say the basics of deep learning, the, you know, say convolution models or the basic kind of things, they'll probably be around in some form still in five years."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "Will RL and GAN stay?"}, {"time": 2898, "text": "Very likely, based on where they are."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Will we have new things?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Probably, but those are hard to predict."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "And some directionally, some things that we can see is, you know, in things that we're starting to do, right, with some of our projects right now is just 2.0 combining eager execution and graphs where we're starting to make it more like just your natural programming language."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "You're not trying to program something else."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "Similarly, with Swift for TensorFlow, we're taking that approach."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Can you do something ground up, right?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "So some of those ideas seem like, okay, that's the right direction."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "In five years, we expect to see more in that area."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Other things we don't know is, will hardware accelerators be the same?"}, {"time": 2943, "text": "Will we be able to train with four bits instead of 32 bits?"}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And I think the TPU side of things is exploring that."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "I mean, TPU is already on version three."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "It seems that the evolution of TPU and TensorFlow are sort of, they're coevolving almost in terms of both are learning from each other and from the community and from the applications where the biggest benefit is achieved."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "You've been trying to sort of, with Eager, with Keras, to make TensorFlow as accessible and easy to use as possible."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "What do you think, for beginners, is the biggest thing they struggle with?"}, {"time": 2980, "text": "Have you encountered that?"}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Or is basically what Keras is solving is that Eager, like we talked about?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Yeah, for some of them, like you said, right, the beginners want to just be able to take some image model, they don't care if it's Inception or ResNet or something else, and do some training or transfer learning on their kind of model."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "Being able to make that easy is important."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So in some ways, if you do that by providing them simple models with say, in hub or so on, they don't care about what's inside that box, but they want to be able to use it."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So we're pushing on, I think, different levels."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "If you look at just a component that you get, which has the layers already smooshed in, the beginners probably just want that."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Then the next step is, okay, look at building layers with Keras."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "If you go out to research, then they are probably writing custom layers themselves or doing their own loops."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So there's a whole spectrum there."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "And then providing the pre trained models seems to really decrease the time from you trying to start."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "You could basically in a Colab notebook achieve what you need."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So I'm basically answering my own question because I think what TensorFlow delivered on recently is trivial for beginners."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So I was just wondering if there was other pain points you're trying to ease, but I'm not sure there would."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "No, those are probably the big ones."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "I see high schoolers doing a whole bunch of things now, which is pretty amazing."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "It's both amazing and terrifying."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "In a sense that when they grow up, it's some incredible ideas will be coming from them."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "So there's certainly a technical aspect to your work, but you also have a management aspect to your role with TensorFlow leading the project, a large number of developers and people."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "So what do you look for in a good team?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "What do you think?"}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Google has been at the forefront of exploring what it takes to build a good team and TensorFlow is one of the most cutting edge technologies in the world."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So in this context, what do you think makes for a good team?"}, {"time": 3110, "text": "It's definitely something I think a favorite about."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "I think in terms of the team being able to deliver something well, one of the things that's important is a cohesion across the team."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "So being able to execute together in doing things that's not an end, like at this scale, an individual engineer can only do so much."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "There's a lot more that they can do together, even though we have some amazing superstars across Google and in the team, but there's, you know, often the way I see it as the product of what the team generates is way larger than the whole or the individual put together."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And so how do we have all of them work together, the culture of the team itself, hiring good people is important."}, {"time": 3163, "text": "But part of that is it's not just that, okay, we hire a bunch of smart people and throw them together and let them do things."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "It's also people have to care about what they're building, people have to be motivated for the right kind of things."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "That's often an important factor."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "And, you know, finally, how do you put that together with a somewhat unified vision of where we wanna go?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So are we all looking in the same direction or each of us going all over?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "And sometimes it's a mix."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "Google's a very bottom up organization in some sense, also research even more so, and that's how we started."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "But as we've become this larger product and ecosystem, I think it's also important to combine that well with a mix of, okay, here's the direction we wanna go in."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "There is exploration we'll do around that, but let's keep staying in that direction, not just all over the place."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And is there a way you monitor the health of the team?"}, {"time": 3226, "text": "Sort of like, is there a way you know you did a good job?"}, {"time": 3231, "text": "The team is good?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "Like, I mean, you're sort of, you're saying nice things, but it's sometimes difficult to determine how aligned."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Because it's not binary."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "It's not like there's tensions and complexities and so on."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And the other element of the mission of superstars, there's so much, even at Google, such a large percentage of work is done by individual superstars too."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So there's a, and sometimes those superstars can be against the dynamic of a team and those tensions."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "I mean, I'm sure in TensorFlow it might be a little bit easier because the mission of the project is so sort of beautiful."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "You're at the cutting edge, so it's exciting."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "But have you had struggle with that?"}, {"time": 3276, "text": "Has there been challenges?"}, {"time": 3278, "text": "There are always people challenges in different kinds of ways."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "That said, I think we've been what's good about getting people who care and are, you know, have the same kind of culture, and that's Google in general to a large extent."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "But also, like you said, given that the project has had so many exciting things to do, there's been room for lots of people to do different kinds of things and grow, which does make the problem a bit easier, I guess."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "And it allows people, depending on what they're doing, if there's room around them, then that's fine."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "But yes, we do care about whether a superstar or not, that they need to work well with the team across Google."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "That's interesting to hear."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "So it's like superstar or not, the productivity broadly is about the team."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "I mean, they might add a lot of value, but if they're hurting the team, then that's a problem."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "So in hiring engineers, it's so interesting, right, the hiring process."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "What do you look for?"}, {"time": 3341, "text": "How do you determine a good developer or a good member of a team from just a few minutes or hours together?"}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Again, no magic answers, I'm sure."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Yeah, I mean, Google has a hiring process that we've refined over the last 20 years, I guess, and that you've probably heard and seen a lot about."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So we do work with the same hiring process and that's really helped."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "For me in particular, I would say, in addition to the core technical skills, what does matter is their motivation in what they wanna do."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "Because if that doesn't align well with where we wanna go, that's not gonna lead to long term success for either them or the team."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And I think that becomes more important the more senior the person is, but it's important at every level."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "Like even the junior most engineer, if they're not motivated to do well at what they're trying to do, however smart they are, it's gonna be hard for them to succeed."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "Does the Google hiring process touch on that passion?"}, {"time": 3404, "text": "So like trying to determine, because I think as far as I understand, maybe you can speak to it, that the Google hiring process sort of helps in the initial like determines the skill set there, is your puzzle solving ability, problem solving ability good?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "But like, I'm not sure, but it seems that the determining whether the person is like fire inside them, that burns to do anything really, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "It's just some cool stuff, I'm gonna do it."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "Is that something that ultimately ends up when they have a conversation with you or once it gets closer to the team?"}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So one of the things we do have as part of the process is just a culture fit, like part of the interview process itself, in addition to just the technical skills and each engineer or whoever the interviewer is, is supposed to rate the person on the culture and the culture fit with Google and so on."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "So that is definitely part of the process."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Now, there are various kinds of projects and different kinds of things."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "So there might be variants and of the kind of culture you want there and so on."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "And yes, that does vary."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "So for example, TensorFlow has always been a fast moving project and we want people who are comfortable with that."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "But at the same time now, for example, we are at a place where we are also very full fledged product and we wanna make sure things that work really, really work, right?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "You can't cut corners all the time."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "So balancing that out and finding the people who are the right fit for those is important."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And I think those kinds of things do vary a bit across projects and teams and product areas across Google."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "And so you'll see some differences there in the final checklist."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "But a lot of the core culture, it comes along with just the engineering excellence and so on."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "What is the hardest part of your job?"}, {"time": 3519, "text": "I'll take your pick, I guess."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "It's fun, I would say, right?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Hard, yes."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "I mean, lots of things at different times."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "I think that does vary."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So let me clarify that difficult things are fun when you solve them, right?"}, {"time": 3533, "text": "So it's fun in that sense."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "I think the key to a successful thing across the board and in this case, it's a large ecosystem now, but even a small product, is striking that fine balance across different aspects of it."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "Sometimes it's how fast do you go versus how perfect it is."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "Sometimes it's how do you involve this huge community?"}, {"time": 3561, "text": "Who do you involve or do you decide, okay, now is not a good time to involve them because it's not the right fit."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Sometimes it's saying no to certain kinds of things."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "Those are often the hard decisions."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "Some of them you make quickly because you don't have the time."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "Some of them you get time to think about them, but they're always hard."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So both choices are pretty good, those decisions."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "What about deadlines?"}, {"time": 3590, "text": "Is this, do you find TensorFlow, to be driven by deadlines to a degree that a product might?"}, {"time": 3600, "text": "Or is there still a balance to where it's less deadline?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "You had the Dev Summit today that came together incredibly."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "Looked like there's a lot of moving pieces and so on."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So did that deadline make people rise to the occasion releasing TensorFlow 2.0 alpha?"}, {"time": 3618, "text": "I'm sure that was done last minute as well."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "I mean, up to the last point."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Again, it's one of those things that you need to strike the good balance."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "There's some value that deadlines bring that does bring a sense of urgency to get the right things together."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Instead of getting the perfect thing out, you need something that's good and works well."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "And the team definitely did a great job in putting that together."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So I was very amazed and excited by everything how that came together."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "That said, across the year, we try not to put out official deadlines."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "We focus on key things that are important, figure out how much of it's important."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "And we are developing in the open, both internally and externally, everything's available to everybody."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So you can pick and look at where things are."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "We do releases at a regular cadence."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So fine, if something doesn't necessarily end up this month, it'll end up in the next release in a month or two."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And that's okay, but we want to keep moving as fast as we can in these different areas."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "Because we can iterate and improve on things, sometimes it's okay to put things out that aren't fully ready."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "We'll make sure it's clear that okay, this is experimental, but it's out there if you want to try and give feedback."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "That's very, very useful."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "I think that quick cycle and quick iteration is important."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "That's what we often focus on rather than here's a deadline where you get everything else."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "Is 2.0, is there pressure to make that stable?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "Or like, for example, WordPress 5.0 just came out and there was no pressure to, it was a lot of build updates delivered way too late, but, and they said, okay, well, but we're gonna release a lot of updates really quickly to improve it."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "Do you see TensorFlow 2.0 in that same kind of way or is there this pressure to once it hits 2.0, once you get to the release candidate and then you get to the final, that's gonna be the stable thing?"}, {"time": 3742, "text": "So it's gonna be stable in, just like when NodeX was where every API that's there is gonna remain in work."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "It doesn't mean we can't change things under the covers."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "It doesn't mean we can't add things."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "So there's still a lot more for us to do and we'll continue to have more releases."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So in that sense, there's still, I don't think we'll be done in like two months when we release this."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "I don't know if you can say, but is there, there's not external deadlines for TensorFlow 2.0, but is there internal deadlines, the artificial or otherwise, that you're trying to set for yourself or is it whenever it's ready?"}, {"time": 3783, "text": "So we want it to be a great product, right?"}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And that's a big important piece for us."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "TensorFlow's already out there."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "We have 41 million downloads for 1.0 X."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "So it's not like we have to have this."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "So it's not like, a lot of the features that we've really polishing and putting them together are there."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "We don't have to rush that just because."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So in that sense, we wanna get it right and really focus on that."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "That said, we have said that we are looking to get this out in the next few months, in the next quarter."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And as far as possible, we'll definitely try to make that happen."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Yeah, my favorite line was, spring is a relative concept."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "I love it."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Spoken like a true developer."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "So something I'm really interested in and your previous line of work is, before TensorFlow, you led a team at Google on search ads."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "I think this is a very interesting topic on every level, on a technical level, because at their best, ads connect people to the things they want and need."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "So, and at their worst, they're just these things that annoy the heck out of you to the point of ruining the entire user experience of whatever you're actually doing."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "So they have a bad rep, I guess."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And on the other end, so that this connecting users to the thing they need and want is a beautiful opportunity for machine learning to shine."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Like huge amounts of data that's personalized and you kind of map to the thing they actually want won't get annoyed."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So what have you learned from this, Google that's leading the world in this aspect, what have you learned from that experience and what do you think is the future of ads?"}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Take you back to that."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Yeah, yes, it's been a while, but I totally agree with what you said."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "I think the search ads, the way it was always looked at and I believe it still is, is it's an extension of what search is trying to do."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "And the goal is to make the information and make the world's information accessible."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "That's it's not just information, but maybe products or other things that people care about."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "And so it's really important for them to align with what the users need."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And in search ads, there's a minimum quality level before that ad would be shown."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "If you don't have an ad that hits that quality, but it will not be shown even if we have it and okay, maybe we lose some money there, that's fine."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "That is really, really important."}, {"time":

kind of the building blocks, CubeSats are fantastic design, it's kind of modular design."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "So I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat and, you know, but what if I have a little bit more money and payload, I can fly three of them and just basically put a lot more instruments on it."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "But essentially think about something the size of a shoe box, if you will."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "You know, that would be a CubeSat."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And how do those help empower you in terms of doing size, in terms of doing experiments?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Oh, right now there's, again, back to private industry, Planet, the company, is, you know, flying CubeSats and literally looking down on Earth and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will, of Earth every day, every 24 hours, covering the entire Earth."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So in terms of Earth observations, in terms of climate change, in terms of our changing Earth, it's

else that you've been excited about, like reusable rockets, perhaps, that you've seen in the last few years?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Yeah, well, the reusability you had, and the reusability is awesome."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I mean, it's just the best."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Now we have to remember, the shuttle was a reusable vehicle."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "Which, and the

recovering the first stages, where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "And just seeing the control, you know, being in control and dynamic as a person, just seeing that rocket come back and land."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Oh yeah, that's."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It never gets old, it's exciting every single time you look at it and say, that's magic."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "So it's so cool."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "To me, the landing is where I stand up, start clapping, just the control."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms, and hitting that landing, it's, you know, it's gymnastics for rocket ships, but to see these guys stick a landing, it's just wonderful."}, {"time": 1501,

of the future look like?"}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Well, if I have anything to say about it, it'll be a very, it'll be a very tight fitting suit."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "We use mechanical counter

apply."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "This is a third of an atmosphere."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Just to sort of take a little step back, you have this incredible biosuit where it's tight fitting, so it allows more mobility and so on."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So maybe even to take a bigger step back, like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Sure, so start from the beginning."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "So I really, that's the best definition I can give you."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "Right now we fly gas pressurized suits, but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So then you take all those systems and you shrink them around a person, provide them with oxygen to breathe, scrub out their carbon dioxide, you know, make sure they have pressure."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "They need a pressure environment to live in."},

1599, "text": "Yeah, communications, exactly."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "So you really, thermal control, little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection, but thermal control, humidity, you know, oxygen debris."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So all those life support systems, as well as the pressure protection."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "So it's an engineering marvel, you know, the spacesuits that have flown because they really are entire spacecraft, they're the small spacecraft that we have around a person, but they're very massive, but 140 kilos is the current suit, and they're not mobility suits."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So since we're going back to the moon and Mars, we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "I study astronauts, I study humans in motion, and if we can map that motion, I want to give you full flexibility, you know, move

suit."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "Oxygen and nitrogen."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And you put a suit, if we put someone to a third of an atmosphere, so for mechanical counter pressure now, so one way

only have to give you a third of an atmosphere."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "So if I put that pressure, a third of an

2412, "text": "Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things."}, {"time": 2418, "text":

way to think about it."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And the customer, at any given moment,

a little bit of work at it."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "The recommendation system will sort of help, right?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "They had a great idea."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "They made a great vacuum cleaner."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "They know they really did it."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "They nailed it."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right?"}, {"time": 2476, "text": "It's not going to be in the recommendation system."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "No one will know about it."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "Maybe there's something good there."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So I will look at it."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know?"}, {"time": 2537, "text": "So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right?"}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "So let's component on that."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "I don't think they care about me."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "I don't think they do."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So what, could you just put your PR hat on?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population?"}, {"time": 2714, "text": "So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "So what do you attribute that to?"}, {"time": 2728, "text": "Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "I mean, that's not even Facebook."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "That's just, I want transparency in human society."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve."},

happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "I think most people do find that creepy."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "It's not for them."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "And they shouldn't."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "They should not be a big brother caring about us."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "That is not the role of a company like that."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Well, Microsoft is pivoting."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "We don't want to do creepy things."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right?"}, {"time": 2848, "text": "There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "I need something for that moment."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a

today I'm going to the shopping mall."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "So I want control over that

maybe of resisting some of the argument."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "The beautiful thing with Nick's arguments is he quickly jumps from the individual scale to the universal scale, which is just awe inspiring to think of when you think about the entirety of the span of time of the universe."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "It's both interesting from a computer science perspective, AI perspective, and from an ethical perspective, the idea of utilitarianism."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "Could you say what is utilitarianism?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Utilitarianism is the ethical view that the right thing to do is the act that has the greatest expected utility, where what that means is it's the act that will produce the best consequences, discounted by the odds that you won't be able to produce those consequences, that something will go wrong."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "But in simple case, let's assume we have certainty about what the consequences of our actions will be, then the right action is the action that will produce the best consequences."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Is that always, and by the way, there's a bunch of nuanced stuff that you talk with Sam Harris on this podcast on that people should go listen to."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "That's like two hours of moral philosophy discussion."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "But is that an easy calculation?"}, {"time": 3125, "text": "No, it's a difficult calculation."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And actually, there's one thing that I need to add, and that is utilitarians, certainly the classical utilitarians, think that by best consequences, we're talking about happiness and the absence of pain and suffering."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "There are other consequentialists who are not really utilitarians who say there are different things that could be good consequences."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "Justice, freedom, human dignity, knowledge, they all count as good consequences too."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "And that makes the calculations even more difficult because then you need to know how to balance these things off."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "If you are just talking about wellbeing, using that term to express happiness and the absence of suffering, I think the calculation becomes more manageable in a philosophical sense."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "It's still in practice."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "We don't know how to do it."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "We don't know how to measure quantities of happiness and misery."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "We don't know how to calculate the probabilities that different actions will produce, this or that."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So at best, we can use it as a rough guide to different actions and one where we have to focus on the short term consequences because we just can't really predict all of the longer term ramifications."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So what about the extreme suffering of very small groups?"}, {"time": 3213, "text": "Utilitarianism is focused on the overall aggregate, right?"}, {"time": 3218, "text": "Would you say you yourself are a utilitarian?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "Yes, I'm a utilitarian."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "What do you make of the difficult, ethical, maybe poetic suffering of very few individuals?"}, {"time": 3234, "text": "I think it's possible that that gets overridden by benefits to very large numbers of individuals."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "I think that can be the right answer."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "But before we conclude that it is the right answer, we have to know how severe the suffering is and how that compares with the benefits."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "So I tend to think that extreme suffering is worse than or is further, if you like, below the neutral level than extreme happiness or bliss is above it."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "So when I think about the worst experiences possible and the best experiences possible, I don't think of them as equidistant from neutral."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So like it's a scale that goes from minus 100 through zero as a neutral level to plus 100."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "Because I know that I would not exchange an hour of my most pleasurable experiences for an hour of my most painful experiences, even I wouldn't have an hour of my most painful experiences even for two hours or 10 hours of my most painful experiences."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Did I say that correctly?"}, {"time": 3303, "text": "Maybe 20 hours then, it's 21, what's the exchange rate?"}, {"time": 3307, "text": "So that's the question, what is the exchange rate?"}, {"time": 3308, "text": "But I think it can be quite high."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "So that's why you shouldn't just assume that it's okay to make one person suffer extremely in order to make two people much better off."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "It might be a much larger number."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "But at some point I do think you should aggregate and the result will be, even though it violates our intuitions of justice and fairness, whatever it might be, giving priority to those who are worse off, at some point I still think that will be the right thing to do."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "Yeah, it's some complicated nonlinear function."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "Can I ask a sort of out there question is, the more and more we put our data out there, the more we're able to measure a bunch of factors of each of our individual human lives."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And I could foresee the ability to estimate wellbeing of whatever we together collectively agree and is in a good objective function from a utilitarian perspective."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "Do you think it'll be possible and is a good idea to push that kind of analysis to make then public decisions perhaps with the help of AI that here's a tax rate, here's a tax rate at which wellbeing will be optimized."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "Yeah, that would be great if we really knew that, if we really could calculate that."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "No, but do you think it's possible to converge towards an agreement amongst humans, towards an objective function or is it just a hopeless pursuit?"}, {"time": 3402, "text": "I don't think it's hopeless."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "I think it would be difficult to get converged towards agreement, at least at present, because some people would say, I've got different views about justice and I think you ought to give priority to those who are worse off, even though I acknowledge that the gains that the worst off are making are less than the gains that those who are sort of medium badly off could be making."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "So we still have all of these intuitions that we argue about."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "So I don't think we would get agreement, but the fact that we wouldn't get agreement doesn't show that there isn't a right answer there."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "Do you think, who gets to say what is right and wrong?"}, {"time": 3441, "text": "Do you think there's place for ethics oversight from the government?"}, {"time": 3482, "text": "Politically, I'm still a Democrat despite looking at the flaws in democracy and the way it doesn't work always very well."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "So I don't see a better option than allowing the public to vote for governments in accordance with their policies."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "And I hope that they will vote for policies that reduce the suffering of animals and reduce the suffering of distant humans, whether geographically distant or distant because they're future humans."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "But I recognise that democracy isn't really well set up to do that."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "And in a sense, you could imagine a wise and benevolent, you know, omnibenevolent leader who would do that better than democracies could."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "But in the world in which we live, it's difficult to imagine that this leader isn't gonna be corrupted by a variety of influences."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "You know, we've had so many examples of people who've taken power with good intentions and then have ended up being corrupt and favouring themselves."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "So I don't know, you know, that's why, as I say, I don't know that we have a better system than democracy to make these decisions."},

simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can see and it'll fly."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It basically flies a straight line."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains at night."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "You're going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through like fog layers, cause you don't need to see outside."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're literally flying a little TV screen and radar."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "What are you looking at most of the time?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So you're just at a screen."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "It's this really primitive."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a tram."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feed off of a pulse radar in front."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So it's just basically mapping the mountain."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in this valley."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what the airplane would do."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And so, and sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So you're, you're actually just control."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "I'm flying the jet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "The throttle's the stick and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe four inches, five inches high."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "It looks like it's literally a CRT."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "That's how old it is."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "A CRT screen."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the airplane."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're dodging mountains and stuff."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And then it just keeps going out like that."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And we were just driving right at it."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And I could see that that bump was moving towards me."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn't like a video game."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual 3D environment based on that little Atari's solid display."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You're exactly right."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And you have to, you have to train."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So there's been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me, but it's true."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I'll name him, his name's Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think computer engineering, he's scary smart."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first night traps together."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just, you're never going to forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "We'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system, one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it's, you almost talk in partials."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain, that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like you have to rehearse it, you have to know, and you talk in full sentences."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing and he'd get like rising out and before he finished, I'd say, I've got it."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean, there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Remember the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "Remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way to the left and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So he's telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So my truck."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And this is all happening quick?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Very quick."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "How many miles an hour?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Well, 420 is seven miles a minute."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "That's fast."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "At night."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "I mean, I broke out of clouds."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it's the IR, it's called an IR route, an instrument route that's low, they're all around the country."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "There's the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you'd fly from the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You can't see anything."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called the anti collision lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it's a decent night."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And this is right by Mount St. Helens."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "This is kind of where we're coming in."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the route goes."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right next to you, but you're flying along."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "You're just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights, they're above you."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys and stuff."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So just incredible experience."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So when you take that and then you move into an F18F."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you're flying."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're sharing the load."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk and he's got actually, he uses his feet."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Just out of curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "Because that term comes up a lot."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "Think of it as a God's eye view."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "The pilot's is smaller."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "It's down between his, it's a six by six between his legs and they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it'd be like looking down and going, oh, I'm right here."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here."}, {"time":

different sensors and gives you a big picture view."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "What about the control?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you

actually look to the right."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "The targeting flare will look to the right."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he can do things."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So depending on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don't see, that maybe the radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because it's a phased array radar now, it doesn't really scan."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time, and then let that thing fly."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we're gonna have to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "Now it's that fast."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an AI system?"}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "Like how much does the human contribute?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in flying a fighter jet plane?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So I would say AI systems are usually black and white."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it's really, it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing, right?"}, {"time": 2310, "text": "So you've got this logical math problem."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "Math problems are, there's a line that says I can or I can't."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And it's a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I'll try it."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "So humans can operate within that gray."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while, a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance model of the airplane."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really physics based."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight, right?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is, that's where the human goes, can I do this?"}, {"time": 2382, "text": "I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage, there are things that a human will do that AI won't."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And I don't think we've got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Most AI is logical."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "It's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "There's bounds."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "Yeah, there's this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real life also gets at that somehow."},

Sully landing that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co

the same guy all the time is slim and none."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Where in the Navy, we were crewed."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "For months?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Because you want to get to know, trust and all of those things."},

a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troops."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you do that."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you're going to be ineffective."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial, there is a standardization."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And everyone, they know their roles."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York area."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "They silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The first officer is pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully's actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we're going to put this thing."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And he did it flawlessly."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, and it got fished out of the Hudson."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "What is it about those

decisions."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency procedures that we have to know."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?"}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So they know."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed, they're built to have some time."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "He looked, he made a quick assessment."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, it's like a multiple choice test when you go, oh my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong, gone."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "So the Jersey airport and

started."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "The closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "So the original decision to, this is my best option

this, I'm trained, I'm going to do the procedures, I've practiced this before, I've done these things."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "And I, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, cause I never thought about when things were really bad."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "You know, if you're having problems with the airplane that, you know, that I was going to mort, you know, and, and plant it into the ground, it was always, you know, maybe it's an ego thing where you think I can do this."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "I mean, So you never, have you experienced fear during flight, like, I mean, one,

go."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And it's purely to put in towards his fear, but as he gets closer and closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over to where

to roll the airplane upside down and then I'm going to do basically a C the letter C I'm going to go in the top and out the bottom."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "So and I'm just against basically a vertical displacement of the airplane."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "So I'm going from high to low."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "It's very, very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet, give

airplane is to work in the vertical, because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "So they're profound."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no, or do you, do you truly start to think in that third dimension, like the rich 3d world

going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that's where he's going to be."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And I'm trying to, you know, basically join up on him."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "But I also had to look at it to go, do I have enough altitude to do this?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "Because what I did before here and I do this, I'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "And then, you know, I have to get that energy back to get up to him."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "So you have, this is, this is really important when you're, when you're fighting airplanes and you're really max performing."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he's literally playing with it."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "He's got a finite amount of energy, right?"}, {"time": 3847, "text": "He can add some with the motors and stuff, but you're, what you're really doing is it's a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy, speed for altitude, which gives you potential energy."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "The other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't bleed energy."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S, that it's going to cost me energy."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the bottom at probably 200 knots."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that, to kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high performance turn."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "So you've got to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your overall energy package."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "So you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "But if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's just going to pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "It's overall energy package and that's that you've got to be constantly evaluating where you're at."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And this is that 80% solution."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "Can I afford to do this or not?"}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And you have literally a split second

of a 737."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave is breaking over the top and you're going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you'd see this kind of shape."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So it looks like a cross."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So as we're looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim, says this is that talking in partials again."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "He says, hey, Skipper, do you?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And that's about what he gets out of his mouth."},

helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it's going sideways left and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "This thing's not, it's like left, right, left, right with no."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things you've seen in the past."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash. What is that thing?"}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So by this time we're driving around."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So as we're, if we were at the six oclock, we're driving around towards that nine oclock position and we're just watching this thing."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "And it's just, it's still pointing north, south, and it's going left, right, and it's kind of moving around the object."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "So if you've got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it and it's going up."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "It's just kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And I said, yeah, stay up high."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Because now we get, we get a different perspective."}, {"time": 5015,

high cover, whatever."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "She's watching me, which is, it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that thing disappears."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And they don't, you know, because if it's just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no, it's over to the right."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "We can still see it."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "We all lost it at the same time."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed."},

the West and starts coming up."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So now it's obviously knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "Whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5073,

15."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "It's just estimating."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So you can see it's just a really easy descent because."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "So what's 15 K?"}, {"time": 5106,

around."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two oclock position."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "We're about the eight oclock position and I'm like, oh, I've got,

one end."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "He's going to hold at the other end."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's, if it's a football field, we're going to sit on one goal line."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "He's going to sit on the other goal line."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and then try and do something in the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset points."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "So you're talking to him."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "He's, he's, he's listening to the, he's just listening."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "We don't talk to him at all."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "He's just listening."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "He just dials up."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Cause they know that we all know the frequencies."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, cause they canceled training."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So what else is he going to do?"}, {"time": 5293, "text": "He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his wingman."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "So they just, they're listening to all this go on."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And then at this point you move on."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "We come back up to train."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "We go back as we're flying back the controller."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "Cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the, uh, the, uh, they're called OSs or operations specialists."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "They're the ones that run the radars and we're talking to him and he's like, Hey, sir, you're not going to believe this."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "He's like, that thing is at your cap."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "It showed back up."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "It just popped up."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "This is like 60 miles away."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "It just reappears."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "We're like, Oh, okay."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So we got the radars out."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "We're looking for it."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Uh, we get out there."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "We never see it."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "We never see it again."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "Uh, we do what we need to do."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "We come back to the ship."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "Of course, now we're like, Oh, this is going to be, we're going to, you know, I told him, I told him, I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch, we're going to catch shit for this."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "When we get back to the ship, word's going to get out and we're just going to catch maximum shit."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "And we did."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "We were joking, you know, so the ship plays movies, we have movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So they repeat cause there's a day check and a night check."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "So the same movies in the morning and night play."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "I'll be like, Oh, Hey, I've seen this and it, I'll jump into a movie in the middle and then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together, uh, because that's how we have to do it."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "Cause we're so busy."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "Well, the movies became, and I, it was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "Definitely going to catch some shit, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "So just take him, cause it's whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened, it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "It's at your cap point that that's a different place."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "How the heck did it know what your cap point is?"}, {"time": 5419, "text": "And that's the one of you to no one, you know, you don't, we don't tell it, we don't broadcast it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don't know."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Maybe it knew where we were going."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Cause we use the same one day after day after day, but it, it obviously knew, but you never saw it there."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Never saw it there."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, Hey, look, we just, we just chased this thing."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "They're like, what?"}, {"time": 5441, "text": "I got to chase it."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "And he goes, and so, and that's how he is."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "He's like, I'm going to go."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out, that they don't see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "That's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "I'll probably overlay the video for people to see."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "When he goes out, it's you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically two radar displays up."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So this is called the Azel display."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the, you're at the bottom of it."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "You're at the bottom of the square."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "It's really taken this."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "It's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares it out."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "They square it off."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when he's not trying to lock it."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "It's going, oh, I can see you."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And it's looking for return."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So he gets a return."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "It's not moving because it's, it's sitting in one spot in space."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "He locks it up when he goes to lock it up."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Now he's putting a bunch of energy on it, but he's telling the radar, stare down that line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it, which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with, it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So that's all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart enough to go, that is not a return that I'm expecting."}, {"time": 5553, "text": "Something's messing with me."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I'm being jammed."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does some stuff."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "So you can mean, well, it does, it goes full into, it's being jammed at about every mode you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "So and it's what it does."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "As you said on Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an act of war, right?"}, {"time": 5574, "text": "Active jamming is, when you actively jam another platform, yes, it's technically an act of war."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "It feels like you should be freaking out at this point, I mean."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "So well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle, they have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just toggle around and do stuff."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth elevation on the radar to the targeting pod."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes, oh, what's over there?"}, {"time": 5603, "text": "And it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked together."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "So when he castles over, it's a switch, it looks like a castle switch, what's a castle?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead of looking at the radar, I want to look at the targeting pod, he sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pod's already looking there."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out, he's just receiving IR energy from the tic tac and then the system itself will track the pixels and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you're in."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "So it says, oh, and that's where those little bars you see in the video where the bars come up left and right."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "There's doing some vision based tracking."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "That's exactly what it is."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "So and then he goes through."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "Changes zooms, changes the mode."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "He goes through all the modes, so there's a narrow, medium and wide."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So wide is far away, medium and then narrow."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background to a white background."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So you can figure out what the heck is this?"}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes instead of just staring at it going, what is that thing?"}, {"time": 5685, "text": "So the video has been out, it actually was on YouTube for years before the government released it."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "It was leaked in 2007?"}, {"time": 5694, "text": "No, the guy that was in my backseat sent me an email and I had retired."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "So this is about, nope, because I was working down in San Diego."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "So this is about 2008, early 2009, he sends me a link to strangeland.com, which is not suitable for work."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "Oh yeah, it's top notch."}, {"time": 5718, "text": "And he says, I can remember the email, hey Skip, does this look familiar?"}, {"time": 5724, "text": "And I look at it, I'm like, how the hell did that get on strangeland.com?"}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube link to someone."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "You don't send strangeland.com to someone because you don't know what you're going to get."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "It's like Googling kittens."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "So it ends up there somehow."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "So it gets on YouTube, which was cool because I would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they go, dude, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying?"}, {"time": 5753, "text": "It's kind of like you were asking what it's like."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "And I go, oh dude, I chased a UFO and they're like, get out."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "And I'm like, no, serious."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "This is literally how it happened."}, {"time": 5761, "text": "So I was sitting with my friend Matt."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "So Matt and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the A6 when I did my very first night trap."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "And we were friends to this day."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "Because when you do stuff like people like that, I had to have faith in him, he had to have faith in me, they become like your brother."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "And these are guys that literally, I don't talk to them on a regular basis, like Chris who works at Apple."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "If Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "I need this."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out and let's do it."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "Because it's, they're like family, you do it."}, {"time": 5794, "text": "And most Navy guys, we don't send letters to each other weekly."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "You know, I have friends that I haven't talked to in 10 years that they showed up on my door, you know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit, take about first 10 minutes to catch up."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "And then it's like old times and it's amazing how fast it's happened."}, {"time": 5811, "text": "So I'm out to dinner with Matt and I'm telling him this story and he's like, get out of here."}, {"time": 5817, "text": "So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco, Paco has fightersweep.com, it's a blog site."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "So Paco's obsessed, like he is way into UFOs."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "So Paco calls me up, he says, dude, I was talking to Matty."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "That's what we call him."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "He goes, I was talking to Matty."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "He goes, dude, you got to tell me this story."}, {"time": 5838, "text": "So I'm like, all right."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "I'm going to spend a chunk of time and so he calls me one day and I'm like, I got to get a voicemail."}, {"time": 5845, "text": "Hey, give me a call."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So I call him up and he answers the phone, but I could hear people in the background and I go, hey dude, what's going on?"}, {"time": 5850, "text": "He goes, hang on, hang on."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "I got to put you on speakerphone."}, {"time": 5852, "text": "I go, what are you putting me on speakerphone?"}, {"time": 5853, "text": "He goes, you got to tell the story."}, {"time": 5854, "text": "I'm having a dinner party."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "You got to tell the story."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table as I tell a Tic Tac story."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "So he calls me up again."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "He says, hey, I got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff."}, {"time": 5868,

guy, Nasty."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "So he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there's another guy, Mav, was one of our landing signals officers for the air wing."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "It's a good article on how this was and how it kind of forms you in Naval Aviation, kind of being part of the club."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "So he's like, I got to write about this thing."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "I'm like, what do you guys, I got to write about it."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "I go, all right."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "Because at first I would say no."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "I'm like, dude, I don't want this out there."}, {"time": 5913,

because you caught some."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "You know, it was just, I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two days."}, {"time": 5928, "text": "They played the goofy movies."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that they would put."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "It was like first one was a far side and the second one was me

that."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "So to me it wasn't that big of a deal."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "It was like, okay, that's weird."}, {"time": 5947, "text": "We're never going to know what it was."},

spread faster than, or just rumors spread faster than anything on these ships, that it might've been a joke that started and."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "Well, they did."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "So here's the joke."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "So they had come down, right?"}, {"time": 6033, "text": "We had the tapes and they were Chad's tapes."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "So we use those tapes over and over again."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "They're consumable, but remember, I have a budget as a squadron, so I have a budget."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "So I have to buy those tapes, all that stuff

then someone, because I have, you know people, shortly after they came and got the tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're messing with you, they're playing a joke."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "So I said, oh, well, let's see how well that goes because I'm a CO and they're not."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "So I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a Lieutenant or Lieutenant JG, so he's way junior to me."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "And I said, hey, I want my tapes back and he looks at me and I go, I know you guys are pulling my leg."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "I know

I told him."}, {"time": 6106, "text": "And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not gonna go well."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "I said, because this is bullshit and

know, is it detrimental to national defense?"}, {"time": 7923, "text": "But there's a point where you have to look and go, if we had a technology like this that could literally change the way mankind

ability to go, because remember, these things were coming down when the cruiser tractor from above 80,000 feet, which is space, and they would come down and they would come straight down, they'd hang out at like 20,000 feet and then three or four hours later, they'd go back up."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "You don't have anything that can come down, hang out and once, you know, and I'm talking hold

fuel."}, {"time": 7981, "text": "The whole of it indicates a kind of technology that's highly advanced, but you don't think in your sense that you actually don't know, but you know more than a lot of

for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "Because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time."}, {"time": 8016,

technology."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "You know, and the other one is, do we have the basis to do that?"}, {"time": 8046, "text": "You know, because usually when you have a technology like that, universities, especially the one you're working at, MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top tier universities, you know, so you've got MIT, you've got Caltech, you've got Stanford, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, I'm just naming schools, Naval Postgraduate School is another one."}, {"time": 8067, "text": "There's usually indicators, there's papers of, hey, this is where we're going."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity based propulsion system that literally, I've got an object, because how do you, how much power would it cost to create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant orb that we live on?"}, {"time": 8088, "text": "Also by the way, you mentioned gravity based."}, {"time": 8090, "text": "That's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what kind of propulsion would have to be involved in order to

other one, someone asked me, they said, what if there wasn't, maybe it was just a drone, maybe it was a UAV that got sent here from someplace else."}, {"time": 8153, "text": "I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around."}, {"time": 8159, "text": "I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff up."}, {"time": 8164, "text": "I was supposed to be on a

to play it?"}, {"time": 8220, "text": "But what he's done, to me, it changed the game, and here's why."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "Because I said, I think it was 62 when Eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex."}, {"time": 8230, "text": "Which it has become, everything he warned us of, it has become, and it's really driven by, there's the big three in defense, which is really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing."}, {"time": 8243, "text": "Those are the big, those are your biggest, and Raytheon's kind of right, like a subset of that."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "But Raytheon's pretty big too."}, {"time": 8250, "text": "But in US defense, those are the big guys, right?"}, {"time": 8252, "text": "That's actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire, they go do stuff like that."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "And you look at that, and you go, and the way government contracting is working, and how we charge, and why things cost so much."}, {"time": 8264, "text": "And then you go, you got Elon, who's got an ego, and he doesn't like to do things a certain way."}, {"time": 8271, "text": "And I've talked to the guy that worked there on, because the government likes to have oversight of contracts, where he was like, no, just tell me what you want, I'll build it, and I'll give you a bill when it's done."}, {"time": 8279, "text": "And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money, because he's a money driven guy, which I like, capitalism at its best."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "So now you look at the two things."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "So you got the SpaceX, which is the Dragon capsule, right?"}, {"time": 8293, "text": "And then you've got Boeing."}, {"time": 8295, "text": "So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money."}, {"time": 8301, "text": "And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters, because they come back and land, and you don't have to, like Morton Thicol, we've reused them on the space shuttle."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "But they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff, because they landed in Saltwater, and then he had to put them all back together."}, {"time": 8314,

can use them again."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "They're reusable systems."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here's a private company."}, {"time": 8327, "text": "So being able to put people in the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean, it's literally like sci fi when you watch when they went up."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company have been able to do, because the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian government, and oh, by the way, if you didn't know, because I have some friends that are astronauts, they all have to learn Russian."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "And they have to do, it's what, level five, where the test is a phone call, where they call you up and they, because they would go, so I went to the pinning, two friends of mine."}, {"time": 8359, "text": "The one actually had a mission date, the one got one later."}, {"time": 8361, "text": "So it's cool when you're watching your friends doing a spacewalk, because I would pull up, because if I knew what was going on, I'd pull up the NASA thing."}, {"time": 8367, "text": "I was in a meeting one day, and I've got NASA on and makers out there floating around doing his stuff."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "And I saw one, he's in the space station while they're doing a spacewalk, so it's kind of cool when you go, oh yeah, I know that dude, he's up there in space, floating around."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "So when you look at what those, they're capable of doing, and then you go, what Elon is bringing to the fact that now it's back in America, it's actually, to me, it's cost effective for us to be able to do more stuff."}, {"time": 8398, "text": "I think it opens the door to, do we go back to the moon?"},

screen."}, {"time": 9691, "text": "And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to explain that is the tracking system."}, {"time": 9702, "text": "Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object."}, {"time": 9708, "text": "The tracking loses it."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because

9780, "text": "And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "The tracking gate will start to open up."}, {"time": 9792, "text": "And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough."}, {"time": 9797, "text": "It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually flip around to kind

one of them."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "Oh, it's here and it flipped over."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front."}, {"time": 9821, "text": "It stays like this."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this."}, {"time": 9825, "text": "So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like one of them, the go fast as a bird."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's on black hot."}, {"time": 9838, "text": "So the white object is actually colder than the ocean."}, {"time": 9843, "text": "If they were colder than the ocean, they'd be dead."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the apparent rotation of the object."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of."}, {"time": 9862, "text": "And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "Now, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked

in each other's wedding."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "So that's how well they know each other."}, {"time": 9895, "text": "OK, so what you don't see is."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new phased array radar that's made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?"}, {"time": 9908, "text": "It doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real."}, {"time": 9911, "text": "So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there."}, {"time": 9916, "text": "Well, the targeting pod, there's heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's there."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing."}, {"time": 9922, "text": "So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit, look at that thing."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "And it's in the wind and it's going against the wind while it's doing this."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "You know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's in a turn."}, {"time": 9937, "text": "This thing doesn't change aspect."}, {"time": 9938, "text": "It just rotates."},

that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering."}, {"time": 9951, "text": "So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look."}, {"time": 9954,

this thing and here's what we know about it so far."}, {"time": 11350, "text": "Or you don't tell them anything because you, cause remember if you, if you reveal someone else's research, you can taint

into a short."}, {"time": 995, "text": "Like these funds put a lot into one or two names."}, {"time": 998, "text": "And so it was very, very badly risk managed."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Do you think

fraudulent companies say, this company is a fraud."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Maybe that's okay."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Like some, but they weren't even saying, they're just saying it's a bad

like more than 1% of our fund."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So we actually have right now, 250 shorts."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "I don't know any of them except for one because it was one of the meme

that, but we just want them to not go up as much as our longs."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So by shorting a little bit, we can actually go long more in the things we do believe in."}, {"time": 1096,

lend us money because we had longs and shorts, because we didn't have market exposure, we didn't have market risk."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "And so I think that's a good thing because that means we can short the oil companies and go long Tesla and make the future come forward faster."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And I do think that's not a bad thing."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So we've talked about this incredible distributed system created by Wall Street Bets."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And then there's a platform which is Robinhood, which allows investors to efficiently as far, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's those and there's others in this new MRI that allow you to make it accessible for people to invest."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But that said, Robinhood was in a

damage could have been done if the momentum of these short squeezes could continue?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "What happens when there are short squeezes, even if they're in a few stocks, they affect kind of all the other shorts too."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And suddenly brokers are saying things like, you need to put up more collateral."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So we had a short, it wasn't GameStop luckily, it was Blackberry and it went up like 100% in a day."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "The AIs don't like it, okay?"}, {"time": 1219, "text": "The AIs think it's going down."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "What's a meme stock?"}, {"time": 1222, "text": "A meme stock is kind of a new term for these stocks that catch memetic momentum on Reddit."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "And so the meme stocks were GameStop, the biggest one, GameStonk, as Elon calls it, AMC."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And Blackberry was one, Nokia was one."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So these are high short interest stocks as well."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So these are targeted stocks."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Some people say, oh, isn't it adorable that these people are investing money in these companies that are nostalgic?"}, {"time": 1259, "text": "It's like, you go into the AMC movie theater, it's like nostalgic."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "It's like, no, it's not why they're doing it."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "It's that they had a lot of short interest."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "That was the main thing."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And so there were high chance of short squeeze."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "In saying, I would love to see an alternate history, do you have a sense that that, what is your prediction of what that history would look like?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Well, you wouldn't have needed very many more days of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "I think it's underrated how damaging it could have been."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Because when your shorts go up, your collateral requirements for them go up."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "It's similar to Robinhood."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Like we have a prime broker that says, said to us, you need to put up like $40 per $100 of short exposure."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And then the next day they said, actually you have to put up all of it, 100%."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And we were like, what?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But if that happens to all the short, all the commonly held hedge fund shorts, because they're all kind of holding the same things."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "If that happens, not only do you have to cover the short, which means you're buying the bad companies, you need to sell your good companies in order to cover the short."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So suddenly like all the good companies, all the ones that the hedge funds like are coming down and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up in a cascading way."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So I believe that if you could have had a few more days of GameStop doubling, AMC doubling, you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit, but they, do you have a sense that they do some good for the world?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "I mean, ultimately, so, okay."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "First of all, Wall Street bets itself is a kind of distributed hedge fund."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "Numeri is a kind of hedge fund."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "So I got, hedge fund is a very broad category."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "I mean, like if some of those were destroyed, would that be good for the world?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Or would there be coupled with the destroying the evil shorting, would there be just a lot of pain in terms of investment in good companies?"}, {"time": 1398, "text": "Yeah, a thing I like to tell people if they hate hedge funds is, I don't think you want to rerun American economic history without hedge funds."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So on mass they're, yeah, they're good."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Yeah, you really wouldn't want to."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up, they're making liquidity, right, in stocks."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And so if you love venture capitalists, they're investing in new technology, it's so good."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "You have to also kind of like hedge funds because they're the reason venture capitalists exist because their companies can have a liquidity event when they go to the public markets."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So it's kind of essential that we have them."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "There are many different kinds of them."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "I believe we could maybe get away with only having an AI hedge fund."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "But we don't necessarily need these evil billions type hedge funds that make the media and try to kill companies."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "But we definitely need hedge funds."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Maybe from your perspective, because you run such an organization and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood, sort of had to make decisions really quickly, probably had to wake up in the middle of the night kind of thing."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, which I just signed up for."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It was a fascinating, one of the great journalistic

directions."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "Like what do you take from this whole situation?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "I was very excited to see Vlad's response."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "I mean, it's pretty cool to have him talk to Elon."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And one of the things that like struck me in the first like few seconds of Vlad speaking was like, I was like, is Vlad like a boomer?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Like, but hear me out."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Like he seemed like a 55 year old man talking to a 20 year old."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "Elon was like the 20 year old."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And he's like the 55 year old man."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies, right?"}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Like you can, you can see why."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "It's like, this is a nice, it's not a bad thing."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "It's like, he's got a respectable professional attitude."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Like, no, we're not being ageist here."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "Boomer, but like a 60 year old CEO of Bank of America would try to make a joke for the kids."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "That's what Vlad's like."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "Yeah, I was like, what is this?"}, {"time": 1611, "text": "This guy's like, what is he, 30?"}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And I'm like, this is weird."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "But I think, and maybe that's also what I like about Elon's kind of influence on American business is like, he's super like anti the professional."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "Like why say, you know, a hundred words about nothing?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying, Vlad, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Spill the beans, bro."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Yeah, so you don't have to be courteous."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "It's like the first principles thinking."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "It's like, what the hell happened?"}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Let's just talk like normal people."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "The problem of course is, you know, for Elon, it's cost them, what is it?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "But perhaps it's a worthy price to pay because ultimately there's something magical about just being real and honest and just going off the cuff and making the mistakes and paying for them, but just being real."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And then moments like this, that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And it felt like he wasn't."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "Do you think we'll ever find out what really went down if there was something shady underneath it all?"}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened, but his presence made it shady."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Sometimes I feel like that would mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Sometimes I feel like, yeah, there's a lot of shitty things that Facebook is doing, but sometimes I think he makes it look worse by the way he presents himself about those things."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Like I honestly think that a large amount of people at Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system and they're all, not all, but mass are trying to do good with this chaotic system."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "But the presentation is like, it sounds like there's a lot of back room conversations that are trying to manipulate people."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And there's something about the realness that Elon has that it feels like CEO should have and Vlad had that opportunity."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too when he was younger."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Younger."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "You can't say, you know, lol to an interview."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And then suddenly he became like this distant person that was hot."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "Like you'd rather have him make mistakes, but be honest than be like professional and never make mistakes."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Yeah, one of the difficult hires I think is like marketing people or like PR people is you have to hire people that get the fact that you can say lol on an interview."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Or, you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR, I've talked to quite a few big CEOs and the people around them are trying to constantly minimize risk of like, what if he says the wrong thing?"}, {"time": 1788, "text": "What if she says the wrong thing?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "It's like, what, be careful."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It's constantly like, ooh, like, I don't know."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time with larger and larger teams where the whole thing, like I visited YouTube, for example."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Everybody I talked at YouTube, incredible engineering and incredible system, but everybody's scared."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Like, let's be honest about this like madness that we have going on of huge amounts of video that we can't possibly ever handle."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "There's a bunch of hate on YouTube."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "There's this chaos of comments, bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And then just like this mess that we're dealing with and it's exciting, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "It's a place where like democratizes education, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And instead they're all like sitting in like, trying to be very polite and saying like, well, we just want to improve the health of our platforms."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Like, it's like this discussion like, all right, man, let's just be real."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Let's both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is, but also to say like, we don't know what we're doing."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "We don't know how to like handle it."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And just being real like that, because I suppose that's just a skill."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Maybe it can't be taught, but over time, the whatever the dynamics of the company is, it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn down."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "They just get tired."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "They get tired of."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Not being real."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Of not being real, which is sad."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "So let's talk about Numerai, which is an incredible company system idea, I think, but good place to start."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "What is Numerai and how does it work?"}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So Numerai is the first hedge fund that gives away all of its data."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So this is like probably the last thing a hedge fund would do, right?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Why would we give away a data?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "It's like giving away your edge."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "But the reason we do it is because we're looking for people to model our data."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So when you look at Numerai's data that you can download for free, it just looks like a million rows of numbers between zero and one."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And you have no idea what the columns mean, but you do know that if you're good at machine learning or have done regressions before, you know that I can still find patterns in this data, even though I don't know what the features mean."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And the data itself is a time series data."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And even though it's obfuscated, anonymized, what is the source data like approximately?"}, {"time": 1947, "text": "So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors and they would also never want us to share that data."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So we have strict contracts with them."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "So we only can, but that's the kind of data you could never buy yourself unless you had maybe a million dollars a year of budget to buy data."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So what's happened with the hedge fund industry is you have a lot of talented people who used to be able to trade and still can trade, but now they have such a data disadvantage, it would never make sense for them to trade themselves."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "But Numerai, by giving away this obfuscated data, we can give them a really, really high quality data set that would otherwise be very expensive."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And they can use whatever new machine learning technique they want to find patterns in that data that we can use in our hedge fund."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And so how much variety is there in underlying data?"}, {"time": 2007, "text": "We're talking about, I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms, but one is just like the stock price."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "The other, there's like options and all that kind of stuff, like the, what are they called, order books or whatever."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Is there maybe other totally unrelated directly to the stock market data, like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "Yeah, we were really focused on stock data that's specific to stocks."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "So things like you can have like a, every stock has like a PE ratio."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "For some stocks, it's not as meaningful, but every stock has that."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Every stock has one year momentum, how much they went up in the last year, but those are very common factors."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But we try to get lots and lots of those factors that we have for many, many years, like 15, 20 years history."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "And then the setup of the problem is commonly in quant called like cross sectional global equity."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "You're not really trying to say, I believe this stock will go up."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "You're trying to say the relative position of this stock in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So it captures some period of time and you're trying to find the patterns, the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time in order to make short term predictions about what's going to happen."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "Yeah, so our predictions are also not that short."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "We're not really caring about things like order books and tech data, not high frequency at all."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "We're actually holding things for quite a bit longer."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So our prediction time horizon is about one month."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "We end up holding stocks for maybe like three or four months."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So I kind of believe that's a little bit more like investing than kind of plumbing, like to go long a stock that's mispriced on one exchange and short on another exchange, that's just arbitrage."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "But what we're trying to do is really know something more about the longer term future of the stock."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Yeah, so from the patterns, from these like periods of time series data, you're trying to understand something fundamental about the stock, not like about deep value, about like it's big in the context of the market, is it underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "So like, this is about investing."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "It's not about like, just like you said, high frequency trading, which I think is a fascinating open question from a machine learning perspective, but just to like sort of build on that."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So you've anonymized the data and now you're giving away the data."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "And then now anyone can try to build algorithms that make investing decisions on top of that data or predictions on the top of that data."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And so that's, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 2181, "text": "What's the goal of that?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "What are the underlying principles of that?"}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So the first thing is, we could obviously model that data in house, right?"}, {"time": 2189, "text": "We can make an XGBoost model on the data and that would be quite good too."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "But what we're trying to do is by opening it up and letting anybody participate, we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves and a lot better on the stock market doesn't need to be very much."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Like it really matters the difference between if you can make 10 and 12% in an equity market neutral hedge fund because usually you're charging 2% fees."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "So if you can do 2% better, that's like all your fees, it's worth it."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "So we're trying to make sure that we always have the best possible model as new machine learning libraries come out, new techniques come out, they get automatically synthesized."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "Like if there's a great paper on supervised learning, someone on Numerai will figure out how to use it on Numerai's data."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And is there an ensemble of models going on or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three like best performing models?"}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So the way we decide on how to weight all of the predictions together is by how much the users are staking on them."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "How much of the cryptocurrency that they're putting behind their models."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "So they're saying, I believe in my model."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "You can trust me because I'm gonna put skin in the game."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "And so we can take the stake weighted predictions from all our users, add those together, average those together, and that's a much better model than any one model in the sum because ensembling a lot of models together is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Yeah, so you're putting, so there's a kind of duality from the user, from the perspective of a machine learning engineer where it's both a competition, just a really interesting, difficult machine learning problem, and it's a way to invest algorithmically."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So like, but the way to invest algorithmically also is a way to put skin in the game that communicates to you that the quality of the algorithm and also forces you to really be serious about the models that you build."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "So it's like, everything just works nicely together."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "Like, I guess one way to say that is the interests are aligned."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "Okay, so it's just like poker is not fun when it's like for very low stakes."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "The higher the stakes, the more the dynamics of the system starts playing out correctly."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "Like as a small side note, is there something you can say about which kind, looking at the big broad view of machine learning today or AI, what kind of algorithms seem to do good in these kinds of competitions at this time?"}, {"time": 2367, "text": "Is there some universal thing you can say, like neural networks suck, recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck, or they're awesome, like old school, sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better, all that, is there some kind of conclusions so far that you can say?"}, {"time": 2384, "text": "There is definitely something pretty nice about tree models, like XGBoost, and they just seem to work pretty nicely on this type of data."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "So out of the box, if you're trying to come a hundredth in the competition, in the tournament, maybe you would try to use that."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "But what's particularly interesting about the problem that not many people understand, if you're familiar with machine learning, this typically will surprise you when you model our data."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So one of the things that you look at in finance is you don't wanna be too exposed to any one risk."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "Like, even if the best sector in the world to invest in over the last 10 years was tech, does not mean you should put all of your money into tech."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So if you train a model, it would say, put all your money in tech, it's super good."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "But what you wanna do is actually be very careful of how much of this exposure you have to certain features."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Why would you reduce your exposure to the thing that's helping your model the most?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And that's actually this counterintuitive thing you have to do with machine learning on financial data."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So reducing your exposure would help you generalize the things that are..."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "So basically, a financial data has a large amount of patterns that appeared in the past and also a large amount of patterns that have not appeared in the past."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "And so like in that sense, you have to reduce the exposure to red lights, to the color red."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "That's interesting, but how much of this is art and how much of it is science from your perspective so far in terms of as you start to climb from the 100th position to the 95th in the competition?"}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed to one or two features, you can have a lot of volatility when you're playing Numerai."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high if you were getting lucky."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And that's a bit like the stock market."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Sure, take on massive risk exposure, put all your money into one stock and you might make 100%, but it doesn't in the long run work out very well."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "And so the best users are trying to stay high for as long as possible, not necessarily try to be first for a little bit."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So me, a developer, machine learning researcher, how do I, Lex Friedman, participate in this competition and how do others, which I'm sure there'll be a lot of others interested in participating in this competition, what are, let's see, there's like a million questions, but like first one is how do I get started?"}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Well, you can go to numero.ai, sign up, download the data."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "And on the data is pretty small."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "In the data pack you download, there's like an example script, Python script that just builds a XGBoost model very quickly from the data."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "And so in a very short time, you can have an example model."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Is that a particular structure?"}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Like what, is this model then submitted somewhere?"}, {"time": 2630, "text": "So there needs to be some kind of structure that communicates with some kind of API."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "Like how does the whole, how does your model, once you've built, once you create a little baby Frankenstein, how does it then live in the world?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein at home and take care of it."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "We don't want it."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "So you never upload your model to us."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "You always only giving us predictions."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "So we never see the code that wrote your model, which is pretty cool, that our whole hedge fund is built from models where we've never, ever seen the code."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "But it's important for the users because it's their IP, why do they want to give it to us?"}, {"time": 2668, "text": "So they've got it themselves, but they can basically almost like license the predictions from that model to us."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "License the predictions, yeah."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "What some users do is they set up a compute server and we call it Numeric Compute."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "It's like a little AWS kind of image and you can automate this process."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "So we can ping you."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "We can be like, we need more predictions now."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "And then you send it to us."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So that's, is that described somewhere, like what the preferred is, the AWS, or whether another cloud platform, is there, I mean, is there sort of specific technical things you want to say that comes to mind that is a good path for getting started?"}, {"time": 2712, "text": "So download the data, maybe play around, see if you can modify the basic algorithm provided in the example."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And then you, what, set up a little server on the AWS that then runs this model and takes pings and then makes predictions."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And so how does your own money actually come into play doing the stake of a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Yeah, so you don't have to stake."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "You can start without staking."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And many users might try for months without staking anything at all to see if their model works on the real life data, right?"}, {"time": 2754, "text": "And is not overfit."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "But then you can get Numeraire many different ways."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "You can buy it on, you can buy some on Coinbase."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "You can buy some on Uniswap."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "You can buy some on Binance."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So what did you say this is?"}, {"time": 2771, "text": "How do you pronounce it?"}, {"time": 2772, "text": "So this is the Numeraire cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "Yeah, NMR."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "NMR, you just say NMR?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "It is technically called Numeraire."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Numeraire, I like it."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "Yeah, but NMR is simple."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "NMR, Numeraire."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Okay, so, and you could buy it basically anywhere."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Yeah, so it's a bit strange because sometimes people are like, is this like pay to play?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And it's like, yeah, you need to put some money down to show us you believe in your model."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "But weirdly, we're not selling you the, like you can't buy the cryptocurrency from us."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "It's like, it's also, we never, if you do badly, we destroy your cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Okay, that's not good, right?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "You don't want it to be destroyed."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "But what's good about it is it's also not coming to us."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "So it's not like we win when you lose or something, like we're the house."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Like we're definitely on the same team."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "Helping us make a hedge fund that's never been done before."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "Yeah, so again, interests are aligned."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "There's no, there's no tension there at all, which is really fascinating."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "You're giving away everything and then the IP is owned by sort of the code."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "You never share the code."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So since I have you here and you said a hundred, I didn't ask out of how many, so we'll just, but if I then once you get started and you find this interesting, how do you then win or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win if this is something you want to take on seriously from the machine learning perspective, not from a financial perspective?"}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Yeah, I think that first of all, you would want to talk to the community."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "People are pretty open."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "We give out really interesting scripts and ideas for things you might want to try."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "And, but you're also going to need a lot of compute probably."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And so some of the best users are, you know, actually the very first time someone won on Numerai, I would, I wrote them a personal email."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "It's like, you know, you've won some money."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "We're so excited to give you $300."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And then they said, I spend way more on the compute, but."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So this is fundamentally a machine learning problem first, I think is this is one of the exciting things."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And I mean, I should say to that, I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in this and I'd love to hear from other people."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "If you're listening to this, if you're a machine learning person, you should participate in it and tell me, give me some hints how I can do well at this thing."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "Cause this boomer, I'm not sure I still got it, but cause some of it is, it's like a Kaggle competitions."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Like some of it is certainly set of ideas, like research ideas, like fundamental innovation, but I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding, getting like an intuition about the data."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out like what works, like tricks."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "I mean, you could argue most of deep learning research is just tricks on top of tricks, but there's some of it is just the art of getting to know how to work in a really difficult machine learning problem."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "And I think what's important, the important difference with something like a Kaggle competition, where they'll set up this kind of toy problem and then there will be an out of sample test, like, Hey, you did well out of sample."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And this is like, okay, cool."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "But what's cool with Numeri is the out of sample is the real life stock market."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We don't even know, like we don't know the onset of the problem."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "We don't, like you'll have to find out live."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "And so we've had users who've like submitted every week for like four years because it's kind of, we say it's the hardest data science problem on the planet, right?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "And it sounds maybe sounds like maybe but too much for like a marketing thing, but it's the hardest because it's the stock market."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "It's like literally there are like billions of dollars at stake and like no one's like letting it be inefficient on purpose."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So if you can find something that works at Numeri, you really have something that is like working on the real stock market."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Yeah, because there's like humans involved in the stock market."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "I mean, you could argue there might be harder data sets like maybe predicting the weather, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "But the fundamental statement here is, which I like, I was thinking like, is this really the hardest data science problem?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "And you start thinking about that, but ultimately it also boils down to a problem where the data is accessible."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's made accessible, made really easy and efficient at like submitting algorithms."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So it's not just, you know, it's not about the data being out there, like the weather."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "It's about making the data super accessible, making the ability of community around it."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Like this is what ImageNet did."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Like it's not just, there's always images."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "The point is you aggregate them together."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "You give it a little title."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "This is a community and that was one of the hardest, right, for a time."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "And most important data science problems in the world because it was accessible, because it was made sort of, like there was mechanisms by which like standards and mechanisms by which you judge your performance, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "And Numerize actually step up from that."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "Is there something more you can say about why from your perspective it's the hardest problem in the world?"}, {"time": 3144, "text": "I mean, you said it's connected to the market."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So if you could find a pattern in the market, that's a really difficult thing to do because a lot of people are trying to do it."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "But there's also the biggest one is it's non stationary time series."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "We've tried to regularize the data so you can find patterns by doing certain things to the features and the target."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "But ultimately you're in a space where you don't, there's no guarantees that the out of sample distributions will conform to any of the training data."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "And every single era, which we call on the website, like every single era in the data, which is like sort of showing you the order of the time."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Even the training data has the same dislocations."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "And so, yeah, and then there's so many things that you might wanna try."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "There's unlimited possible number of models, right?"}, {"time": 3210, "text": "And so by having it be open, we can at least search that space."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "Zooming back out to the philosophical, you said that Numerai is very much like Wall Street Bets."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "Is there, I think it'd be interesting to dig in why you think so."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "I think you're speaking to the distributed nature of the two and the power of the people nature of the two."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "So maybe can you speak to the similarities and the differences and in which way is Numerai more powerful in which way is Wall Street Bets more powerful?"}, {"time": 3249, "text": "Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Bets story is so interesting to me because it's like, feels like we're connected."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "And looking at how, just looking at the form of Wall Street Bets, I was talking earlier about how, how can you make credible claims?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "You're anonymous."},

work at all."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "People made multiple accounts."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "They made really random models and hoped they would get lucky."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And some of them did."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Staking was our solution to, could we make it so that we could trust?"}, {"time": 3296, "text": "We could know which model people believed in the most."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And we could weight models that had high stake more and effectively coordinate this group of people to be like, well, actually there's no incentive to creating bot accounts anymore."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "Either I stake my accounts, in which case I should believe in them because I could lose my stake or I don't."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "And that's a very powerful thing that having a negative incentive and a positive incentive can make things a lot better."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And staking is like this, is this really nice like key thing about blockchain."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "It's like something special you can do where they're not even trusting us with their stake in some ways."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "They're trusting the blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 3340, "text": "So the incentives, like you say, it's about making these perfect incentives so that you can have coordination to solve one problem."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And nowadays I sleep easy because I have less money in my own hedge fund than our users are staking on their models."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "In some sense, from a human psychology perspective, it's fascinating that the WallStreetBets worked at all, right?"}, {"time": 3368, "text": "That amidst that chaos, emerging behavior, like behavior that made sense emerged."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "It would be fascinating to think if numerized style staking could then be transferred to places like Reddit, you know?"}, {"time": 3384, "text": "And not necessarily for financial investments, but I wish sometimes people would have to stake something in the comments they make on the internet."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "That's the problem with anonymity is like, anonymity is freedom and power that you don't have to, you can speak your mind, but it's too easy to just be shitty."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So this, I mean, you're making me realize from a profoundly philosophical aspect, numerized staking is a really clean way to solve this problem."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "It's a really beautiful way."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "Of course, it only with Numerai currently works for a very particular problem, right?"},

open sourced the code we use for staking in a protocol we call Erasure."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And if Reddit wanted to, they could even use that code to enable staking on our Wall Street pets."},

3470, "text": "We're not going to sell at all."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "And here is a smart contract, which no one in the world, including me, can undo, that says, I have staked millions against

amount, but then just a huge number of users doing that kind of stake."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "That could change the internet."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "It would change, and then Wall Street."},

thought that you're saying AI systems can be dangerous, but you just describe how humans can be dangerous."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "So which is safer?"}, {"time": 3630, "text": "So one thing is, so Wall Street bets these kinds of attacks."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "It's not possible to model, numerize data, and then come up with the idea from the model, let's short squeak, just game stop."},

{"time": 3654, "text": "So I think this, it's, numera could get very powerful without it being dangerous."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "But Wall Street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful, and it'll be pretty dangerous."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, this is a good place to think about numera data today and numera signals and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "Right now, I guess, maybe you can correct me, but the data that we're working with is like a window."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "It's an anonymized, obfuscated window into a particular aspect, time period of the market."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "And you can expand that more and more and more and more, potentially."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "You can imagine in different dimensions to where it encapsulates all the things that, where you could include kind of human to human communication that was available to buy GameStop, for example, on Wall Street bets."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "So maybe as a step back, can you speak to what is numera signals and what are the different data sets that are involved?"}, {"time": 3727, "text": "So with numera signals, you're still providing predictions to us, but you can do it from your own data sets."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "So numera, it's all you have to model our data to come up with predictions."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "Numa signals is whatever data you can find out there, you can turn it into a signal and give it to us."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "So it's a way for us to import signals on data we don't yet have."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And that's why it's particularly valuable, because it's going to be signals."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "You're only rewarded for signals that are orthogonal to our core signal."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "So you have to be doing something uncorrelated."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "And so strange alternative data tends to have that property."}, {"time": 3775,

ratio."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And we have some users, as of recently, as of a week ago, there was a user that created, I think he's in India, he created a signal that is scraped from Wall Street bets."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "And now we have that signal as one of our signals in thousands that we use at Numerai."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "And the structure of the signal is similar, so it's just numbers and time series data."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And it's just like, you're providing a ranking of stocks."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "So you just say, a one means you like the stock, zero means you don't like the stock, and you provide that for 5,000 stocks in the world."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And they somehow converted the natural language that's in the Wall Street bet."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "And they open sourced this Colab notebook."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "You can go and see it."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And so, yeah, it's making a sentiment score."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "And then turning it into a rank of stocks."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "A sentiment score."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "Like, this stock sucks, or this stock is awesome."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "And then converting."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "Just even looking at that data would be fascinating."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "So on the signal side, what's the vision?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "This long term, what do you see that becoming?"}, {"time": 3858, "text": "So we want to manage all the money in the world."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "That's Numerai's mission."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And to get that, we need to have all the data and have all of the talent."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Like, there's no way, first principles, if you had really good modeling and really good data that you would lose, right?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "It's just a question of how much do you need to get really good."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "So Numerai already has some really nice data that we give out."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "This year, we are 10xing that."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And I actually think we'll 10x the amount of data we have on Numerai every year for at least the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So it's going to get very big, the data we give out."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And signals is more data."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "People with any other random data set can turn that into a signal and give it to us."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And in some sense, that kind of data is the edge cases, the weirdness is the, so you're focused on the bulk, the main data."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And then there's just weirdness from all over the place that just can enter through this back door of Numerai signals."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "And it's also a little bit shorter term."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "So the signals are about a seven day time horizon."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "And on Numerai, it's like a 30 day."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So it's often for faster situations."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "You've written about a master plan."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "And you've mentioned, which I love, in a similar sort of style of big style thinking, you would like Numerai to manage all of the world's money."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "So how do we get there from yesterday to several years from now?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "Like what is the plan?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "So you've already started to allure to get all the data and get all the talent, humans, models."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "I mean, the important thing to note there is, what would that mean?"}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And I think the biggest thing it means is if there was one hedge fund, you would have not so much talent wasted on all the other hedge funds."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "Like it's super weird how the industry works."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "It's like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "And another hedge fund has to buy the same data source and hire a PhD."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "And suddenly, a third of American PhDs are working at hedge funds."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And we're not even on Mars."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "And so in some ways, Numerai, it's all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds to go work for Elon."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "And also, the people who are working on Numerai problem, it feels like a lot of the knowledge there is also transferable to other domains."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "One of our top users, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And he's amazing."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "I went to go visit him there."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "And he's got Numerai posters."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "And it looks like the movies."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "It looks like Apollo 11 or whatever."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Yeah, the point is he didn't quit his job to join full time."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "He's working on getting us to Jupiter's moon."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "That's his mission, the Europa Klippa mission."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Actually, literally what you're saying."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "He's smart enough that we really want his intelligence to reach the stock market."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Because the stock market's a good thing."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "Hedge funds are a good thing."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "All kinds of hedge funds, especially."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "But we don't want him to quit his job."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So he can just do Numerai on the weekends."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "And that's what he does."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "And he's like one of our best users."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "From my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense, do you think trading stocks is closer to gambling?"}, {"time": 4086, "text": "Or is it closer to investing?"}, {"time": 4089, "text": "Sometimes it feels like it's gambling as opposed to betting on companies that succeed."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting in general, but from your sense, the way you think about it, is it fundamentally still investing?"}, {"time": 4103, "text": "I do think, I mean, it's a good question."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "I've also seen lately people say, this is like speculation."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Is there too much speculation in the market?"}, {"time": 4115, "text": "And it's like, but all the trades are speculative."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "All the trades have a horizon."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "People want them to work."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "So I would say that there's certainly a lot of aspects of gambling math that applies to investing."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Like one thing you don't do in gambling is put all your money in one bet."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "You have bankroll management, and it's a key part of it."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "And small alterations to your bankroll management might be better than improvements to your skill."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And then there are things we care about in our fund."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "Like we want to make a lot of independent bets."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "We talk about it, like we want to make a lot of independent bets, because that's going to be a higher sharp than if you have a lot of bets that depend on each other, like all in one sector."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "But yeah, I mean, the point is that you want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "Of the underlying value of the company."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "Yeah, you shouldn't have there be like a hedge fund that's able to say, well, I've looked at some data, and all of this stuff's super mispriced."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "That's super bad for society if it looks like that to someone."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "I guess the underlying question then is, do you see that the market often drifts away from the underlying value of companies, and it becomes a game in itself?"}, {"time": 4206, "text": "Like with these, whatever they're called, like derivatives, like the options, and shorting, and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "It's like layers of game on top of the actual, like what you said, which is like the basic thing that the Wall Street Bets was doing, which is like just buying stocks."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "There are a lot of games that people play that are in the derivatives market."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look at the history of what's happened, they hate like credit default swaps, or collateralized debt obligations."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "Like these are the enemies of 2008."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "And then the long term capital management thing, it was like they had 30 times leverage, or something."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "You could just go to a gas station and ask anybody at the gas station, is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?"}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And they just say no."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "It's like common sense just like went out the window."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "So yeah, I don't respect long term capital management."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "But Numerai doesn't actually use any derivatives unless you call shorting derivative."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "We just we do put money into companies."}, {"time": 4289, "text": "And that does help the companies we're investing in."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "It's just in little ways."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "We really did buy Tesla."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And we played some role in its success."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Super small, make no mistake."}, {"time":

real, play the real game."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "So be bold."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "So both, I mean, there's an interesting duality there."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "So there's the way you

5103, "text": "And so if you say, my mission is to, yeah, go to Mars, it's just so bonkers that it's hard to say."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said, is if you say it and you believe it, then actually amazing people come and work with you."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "It's not just skill, but the dreams."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "There's something about

excited about, this is so lame."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "Like what is, this isn't even important."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "Even if you succeed, this is gonna be like terrible."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "This is not good."}, {"time": 5241, "text": "And it's just strange how people can kind of get fake enthusiastic about like boring ideas when there's so many bigger ideas that, yeah, I mean, you read these things, like this company raises money, and it's just like, that's a lot of money for the worst idea I've ever heard."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Some ideas are really big."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "And there's so many ways in which you can present that idea to yourself, to the team you work with, to just, yeah, like to yourself when you're quietly looking in the mirror in the morning, that's really boring or really exciting."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "Like if you're really ambitious with autonomous vehicles, it changes the nature of like human robot interaction, it changes the nature of how we move."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Forget money, forget all that stuff."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "It changes like everything about robotics and AI, machine learning, it changes everything about manufacture."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "I mean, cars, transportation is so fundamentally connected to cars, and if that changes, it's changing the fabric of society, of movies, of everything."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "And if you go bold and take risks and be willing to go bankrupt with your company, as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "And yeah, so that's just an example."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "Like the idea can be big, but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea and think really big with it, then you're not gonna make anything happen."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "Yeah, you're absolutely right in that."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "So you've been connected in your work with a bunch of amazing people."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "How much interaction do you have with investors, that whole process is an entire mystery to me."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "Is there some people that just have influence on the trajectory of your thinking completely, or is it just this collective energy behind the company?"}, {"time": 5386, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how, yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months and I met some incredible investors and I'd almost run out of money."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And once they invested, I was like, I am not gonna let you down."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And I was like, okay, I'm gonna send them like an email update every like three minutes."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "And then they don't care at all."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "So they kind of wanna, I don't know, like, so for some, I like it when it's just like, they're always available to talk, but a lot of building a business, especially a high tech business, there's a little for them to add, right?"}, {"time": 5429, "text": "There's little for them to add on product."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "There's a lot for them to add on like business development."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And if we are doing product research, which is for us research into the market, research into how to make a great hedge fund, and we do that for years, there's not much to tell the investors."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "So that basically is like, I believe in you."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "There's something, I like the cut of your jib."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "There's something in your idea, in your ambition, in your plans that I like."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And it's almost like a pat on the back."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "It's like, go get them kid."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "Yeah, it is a bit like that."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "That's a good way to do it."}, {"time": 5465,

hierarchy is really like, I'm like, what?"}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Well, there's a deep profound lesson in there that I don't know how much you've interacted with computer science people since, but

the right way to do it?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And then you go as opposed to doing the first thing on Stack Overflow, you go down this like rabbit hole of what's the actual proper way to do it."},

a t shirt."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "That's really the right approach to building something that ultimately creates an experience."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "And then you iterate eventually."},

"text": "Like did you see you interacting with another friend?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "I think the first step was like, it's one thing to tell someone about an idea, but it's another thing to put in their hands and kind of see like the way their, their eyes kind of look."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "And when I'd go, I'd walk around cross campus, which is part of Yale, and I'd literally just go up to people and run up to them and be like, try this, try this, you got to try this."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "This is pre quarantine, by the way, of course, this would never be the same post

they come from diverse backgrounds and we want to make sure that they sort of understand what the community is about."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "And then we ask them some questions about how they would deal with certain scenarios, ones that we've had in the past and we feel strongly about."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "And then also ones that are a little more murky, where we want to see that they're sort of thinking about these things in a critical way."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And from there, we choose a set and they have the power to take down posts."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "Of

conversation and connection in their communities in a vulnerable and authentic way."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "And so to that end, which I imagine might be different than the goals of a Facebook, for example, one thing that we want to do is keep things intimate and community based."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "So each school is its own community."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "And perhaps you could have a slightly broader community."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "Maybe you could have a, I know the California system is an obvious one."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "Packed time might be an obvious one."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "And we can think about that."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "But fundamentally, the unit of community is your school or your school community."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "So that's one difference that I think will help us."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "The other thing is that we're scaling intentionally, meaning that when we expand to a school, we have moderators in place."},

growing as we're ready, both technologically, but also socially."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "But as we think we have the tools to preserve the community and to encourage the community to create the sort of content that we want them to create."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "And there's a lot of ways to define community."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "So first of all, there's geographic community as well."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "But the way you're kind of defining community with Yale and Dartmouth is the email, right?"}, {"time": 4876, "text": "That's what gives you, there's a power to the email in the sense that that's how you can verify, efficiently verify yourself with being a single individual in the university."}, {"time": 4884, "text": "In that same way, you can verify your employment at a company, for example, like Google, Microsoft, Facebook."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "Do you see potentially taking on those communities?"}, {"time": 4899, "text": "That'd be fascinating,

about growing."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "It's about learning from each of these communities and iterating."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "I think it's quite likely there are going to be all sorts of communities that could use this tool to improve their culture, so to speak."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "So forgive me, I'm not actually that knowledgeable about the history of attempts of building social networks to solve the problem that you're solving."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "But I was made aware that there was an app or at least a social network called Yik Yak that had a similar kind of focus."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "I think the thing you've spoken about that differs between Librex and Yik Yak is that Yik Yak was defined, am I pronouncing it right even?"}, {"time": 4994, "text": "You good?"}, {"time": 4994, "text": "I'm good."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "I met the founder so I can confirm."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "Okay, you can confirm, cool."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "That it was constrained to a geographical area versus like to the actual community and that somehow had fundamental like actual differences in social dynamics that resulted."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "But can you speak to the history of Yik Yak?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "Like how does Librex differ?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "What lessons have you learned from that?"}, {"time": 5025, "text": "Oh, and I should say that I guess there was controversial, I don't know, I didn't look at the details, but I'm guessing there's a bunch of racism and hate speech and all that kind of stuff that emerged on Yik Yak."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "Okay, so that's an example of like, okay, here's how it goes wrong when you have anonymity on college campuses."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "So how does Librex going to do better?"}, {"time": 5041, "text": "Yeah, Yik Yak had a lot of problems, content problems, but the content problems go deeper than maybe what the press would reveal."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "There's a lot to say and part of it is parsing exactly what to talk about when it comes to Yik Yak and when you talk about startups, I mean you know this, you know startups, and you look at the postmortem, it's almost never what people think it is."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "And oftentimes these things are somewhat unknowable and the degree to which people seeking confirmation bias to somebody, seeking closure, look to find a singular attribute that caused the failure."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "It feels like the little details often make all the difference."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Yes, and I think the details are so little that as humans we are not capable of parsing even what they are."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "But I'll tell you my perspective on it, knowing that I am also a human with biases."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "In this particular case, very significant biases."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "So I started building Librex for its own merits."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "At first I wasn't aware of Yik Yak, but as I started to talk to people about this platform I was building, I was made aware of Yik Yak and I built it from day one with a lot of the issues Yik Yak had in mind."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So as you said, the one difference between Yik Yak is the geographical versus community based aspect."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "Going along with that, one thing I realized by researching social media sites is that the majority of the negative content, the content that's terrible and breaking all the rules is created by really, and the people who are not reformable, so to speak, the people who are not showing the best part of the human experience."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "It's a really small minority, right?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "I remember, I was listening to the founder of 4ChamMoot talk about this, how like one guy was able to basically destroy like large swaths of his community."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "Yeah, that's part of what makes it exciting for that minority is how much power they can have."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "So if you're predisposed to think in this way, it's exciting that you can walk into, like I mentioned the party before, you have a party of a lot of positive people and it feels, especially if you don't have much power in this world, it feels exceptionally empowering to just, to destroy like the lives of many."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And if you think this way, it's a problem."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "But I'm hopeful that you're right, that in most cases it's going to be a minority of people."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "And that's what the research has showed."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And one really powerful thing is that we can really actively control who comes in and out of our community based on the.edu verification."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "And we can also control who's not in our community because we have that lever where each account is associated with a.edu."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "So that's the first point I would point out there."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "Second point is controlled expansion, meaning that we have community moderation."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "We have this panel that allows the moderators to see all of the highly downloaded content, all of the reported content, all the flagged content and look through it and decide what they like and what's appropriate and what's not appropriate."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "And we have, we ping every moderator when there's a report."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "So things are taken down pretty quickly."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "And we have our standards and we have, I think above all of that, we have a mission and it's a community based mission."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "Yik Yak was more of a fun app and by its own admission, it was a place where people could enjoy themselves and could sort of yak."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "Yik Yak, chit chat."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "We have a bigger purpose than that, frankly."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And I think that shows in the people who self select to be on that app, to be on Librex and to be on Yik Yak, respectively."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "The last thing I'll say is Yik Yak was very few characters."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "It was a Twitter esque platform."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And that doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of nuance."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "It doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of conversation."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "Librex is much more long form."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "And so the kind of posts that you'll get on Librex can span pages."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "What people are starting to realize is that they can reach a lot more people at a lot more pertinent of a time a lot more quickly by posting their thoughts on Librex than if they went to their school newspaper."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "And I think the school newspapers might be a little worried about that."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "But more importantly, we're connecting people in this way where long form communication with nuance that takes into account everything that's happening in the community temporally is really available at Librex and not really communicable in 240 or 480 or whatever the number of characters the yaks were bound to."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "And I could talk about the history of Yik Yak if you want me to go further."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "They started, I think they were at 12 schools."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And then spring break hit."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "People told their friends, look at this app."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "A thousand schools signed up and had active communities."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "They had a problem on their hands."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And then the high schools come on board."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "I think a lot of the things you said ring true to me, but especially the vision one, which I do think having a vision in the leadership, having a mission makes all the difference in the world."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "That's both for the engineers that are building, like the team that's building the app, the moderation and users because they kind of, the mission carries itself through the behavior of the people on the social network."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "As a small tangent, let me ask you something about Parler, but it's less about Parler, more about AWS."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "So AWS removed Parler from his platform, you know, for whatever reasons, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "But the fact that AWS would do this was really, really bothered me personally, because I saw AWS as the computing infrastructure and I always thought that part could not put a finger on its scale."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And I don't know what your thoughts are."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "Like, were you bothered by Parler being removed from AWS?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And how does that affect how you think about the computing infrastructure on which Librex is based?"}, {"time": 5445, "text": "I was bothered not so much by Parler specifically being taken out of AWS, but more the fact that something that's like a highway, something that people rely on, that people build on top of, that people assume is going to be somewhat position agnostic, like a road that people drive on, is becoming ideologically sort of discriminatory."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And of course, mind you, Amazon can do what it wants."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "It's a private company and I support the rights of private companies."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "I just, on an ethical and sort of a deep moral level, I wonder, like, at what point should a company sort of be agnostic in that regard and let developers build on top of their infrastructure?"}, {"time": 5487, "text": "And where does that responsibility hold?"}, {"time": 5496, "text": "Yes, it makes you hope that there's going to be, from a capitalistic sense, competitors to AWS would say, like, we're not going to put our finger on the scale."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "I mean, on the highway is a good sort of example."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "It's like if a privately owned highway said, you know, we're no longer going to allow, we're only going to allow electric vehicles."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And a bunch of people in this world would be like, yes, because electric is good for the environment."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "And, you know, I think that's a good example."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "You know, yes, but then you have to consider the, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also like the negative impact on the lives of many others and what that means for innovation and for, like, competition, again, in a capitalistic sense."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "So, there's some nature, there's some level to this hierarchy of our existence that we should not allow to manipulate what's built on top of it."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "It should be truly infrastructure."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "And it feels like compute is storage and compute is that layer."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "Like, it shouldn't be messed with."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "I haven't seen anybody really complain about it, like, in terms of government."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "And I'm not even sure government is the right mechanism through policy and regulation to step in."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "Because again, they do a messy job of fixing things."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "But I do hope there's competitors to AWS to make AWS then step up."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "Because I do think, you know, I'm a fan of AWS, except this."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "Good service."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "It's a good service until this."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "Until, yeah, until they rip out the rug."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "And the point is, it's not that necessarily their decision was a bad one with Parler, in particular."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "It's that, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also the, it takes the good actors that are creating amazing products and makes them more fearful."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "And when you're more fearful, it's the same reason that anonymity is a tool that you don't create the best thing you could possibly create."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "When you're fearful, you don't create."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "I think we've kind of talked about it a little bit."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "But I wonder if we can kind of revisit it a little bit."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "I talked to a guy named Ronald Sullivan, who's a faculty at Harvard, a law professor."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "He was on the legal defense team."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "He was the lawyer for Harvey Weinstein and Aaron Hernandez for the double murder case."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "So he takes on these really difficult cases of unpopular figures because he believes like that's the way you test that we believe in the rule of law."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "But he was, there's a big protest in Harvard to get him, basically censor him and to get him to no longer be faculty dean, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "And it was by a minority of students, but there's a huge blowback, obviously in the public, but also inside Harvard, like that's not okay."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "He stands for the very principles at the founding of Harvard and at the principles of the founding of this country and the law and so on."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "But the basic argument is that it was about safe spaces, that it's unsafe to have somebody who is basically supporting Harvey Weinstein, right?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "What do you think about this whole idea of safe spaces on college campuses?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "Because it feels like the mission of Librex is pushing back against the idea of safe spaces."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "I think safe spaces are fine when they're within people's private lives, within their homes, within their religious organizations."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "I think the problem becomes when the institution starts encouraging or backing safe spaces because what are people being safe from?"}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And oftentimes, it seems like there's this idea that the harm that's being attempted to be mitigated is the harm of confronting opinions you disagree with, opinions you might find repugnant."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "And if this is conflated with a need for safety, then that's where the idea of liberal arts education sort of dies."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "Of course, it's complicated and we still want to have safe intellectual environments."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "But the way that I hear the term safe space used today, I think it doesn't really have a place within the intellectual context."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "I mean, this is why Librex is really exciting, is it's pushing those difficult conversations."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And I'd love to see, ultimately, there does seem to be an asymmetry of power that results in the concept of safe spaces and hate speech being redefined in the slippery slope kind of way where it means basically anything you want it to mean."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And it basically is used to silence people, to silence people."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "They're like good, thoughtful experts."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "I mean, you don't have to slip that far to see why that's a problem."},

things match up?"}, {"time": 3152, "text": "Well, I can tell you how they match up when I was being harsh, the guys that I was being harsh with knew without one shred of doubt that I cared about them more than anything else."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "And that the reason I was giving them this feedback is because I wanted them to be able to lead their troops."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "I wanted them to be able to go accomplish their mission."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So I wasn't being harsh because it

effort."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "He's also very good at it is being a low level engineer."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So like, whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details and he'll talk to the lowest level person in terms of like, somebody who's like working literally on putting parts together."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "He wants to understand what the problem is, what the challenge is."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "If there's an emergency, he wants to understand the actual details of the problem, not like delegating it to a manager, but like, because a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will talk about sort of the power and the importance of delegation."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "Here, he wants to know if there's a big problem, he wants to know the exact detail."}, {"time":

doing."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "That's what it, like he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "And I wonder how many people it's inspiring to."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that, of no matter how high your level of leader is, to be able to do the low level shit."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "And that's a common trait that good leaders have."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything, a good leader, but they go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say, Hey, what is the issue that you're dealing with?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Or, you know, how can I support you?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "How can I give you help?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And one key point that you said is, he said, when there's a problem, he gets in there."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So there's things happening at his companies that they're working."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And so he doesn't have to die."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "I'm not saying he never does, but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on or looking at some subsystem that's functioning well."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "He's got a good leader in there that's handling it."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And he checks in with that leader."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And the leader says, yeah, it's working perfectly."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "He says, great."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "When there's a problem, that's when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he fully understands it."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So that he, when he digs down in the details, and this is important, he's coming from an altitude where he has a better, bigger perspective, not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever, for eight hours and you're staring at, you know, if you were planning a mission and you were planning it for eight hours, you're staring at the maps and the charts and you're figuring out where all the troops are going to be located."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a distant perspective, there's a good chance I'll be able to see holes in your plan that you couldn't see because your perspective was too close."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "So that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher perspective and have a look at it."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "But also there's times where I need to get down there and actually look, you know, if you're looking at a problem and you say, look, I can't figure out boss, I can't figure out how to get to this target."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And I'm looking at it from a distance and I don't see, I might need to start digging in and looking and saying, Oh, here's a route that we can take that actually makes sense."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So I think it's a good example of someone going up and down in altitude to look at problems, understanding what's happening with the frontline troops."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And at the same time, being able to go back to the strategic level."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And I can, it's probably this way."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "The reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla, it wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do that."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "It wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, Hey, this is what the function needs to be."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it happen."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "If he had to actually do that all himself, most likely not possible."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "So that's what leaders should be doing."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "They should go elevate and, and, and then get down in the weeds when they have to, and then go back up."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "The sad thing, this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "Just like you said, he's not dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "It's dealing with like, in this, in the case of the company, life and death, like something that can just completely damage the production line, right?"}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out fires."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And I don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology of that, of how, like he, he's spoken himself that he's worried whether his mind can hold up much longer."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "So hopefully in the near future, he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some subordinate leadership that he fully trusts."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And most important that he has properly trained so that they can handle these day to day fires at least 80% of them."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "So only 20% of the time, does he actually need to go in and solve a problem."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "If he's not doing that right now, then that's going to end up being a problem anytime."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "So I work with companies all the time."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And that's, what's interesting about this is I go and work with a CEO or with a, with a C suite of a company."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "It takes a little while to figure out what's going on."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "I'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me almost anecdotally, right?"}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Number one, so you can let your brain, you know, you can, you can survive a little longer as he put it, but also all the time that you spend as a leader, looking down and into your organization is time that you're not looking up and out."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "So when you're not looking up and out, you're not seeing what the competitors doing."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "You're not seeing where the market's going."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "There's problems that, that, that can come from that."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So if right now he's spending too much time looking down and in, and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don't know if I want to do a startup."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "When you do a startup, you're going to be looking down and in for a while."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "It's going to take a while."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "You're going to have to do all this work yourself."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "You're not going to have the finances to put people manpower behind these things."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "So that's probably he, maybe he's in that mindset a little bit because he's done so many startups over the years."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And so he's in the he's habitually in the weeds."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "So my advice would be, all right, let's start looking at formulating some subordinate leadership that has the, like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can, you can start to turn over some of these more minute details to them so that you can start looking up and out."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "I think he's done that more successful in some places than others."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "The SpaceX, a lot of people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of SpaceX as, as a very successful person that runs shit, but in Tesla, not as much."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "So I wonder if you can comment on something a lot of people worry about, and this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people worry about that if Elon disappears, the, the, the innovative spirit, the company is as we know them today

serotonin receptor subtype, which is responsible for a lot of that where these drugs are activating."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Now, mescaline of all the psychedelics, chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "So in the 50s, there was the, 53, I think it was, the Army Chemical Warfare Service wanted to look at drugs for interrogations, mind control, nonlethal incapacitants."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "They did a study in eight substances."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "These were now toxicity studies in animals."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And on the one side was methamphetamine, and the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in the middle, chemically."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So mescaline of these psychedelics tends to have the warmth that MDMA has."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "It's not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I mean, it's the main active ingredient in peyote."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "It is very psychedelic, very visual."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Another distinction with these different drugs is how long they last."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So for example, if you smoke DMT, it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you're, within seconds, you're off in another world."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "Similarly, 5MeO DMT, very rapid."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca, where it's mixed with another substance that makes it so that it's orally active, then it's a couple hours."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Psilocybin is more like five or six hours, or four to six hours."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "MDMA is similar."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "It's one reason why in our research, we give an initial dose of MDMA, and then two hours later, we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau, because we want it to last longer for people to be in this therapeutic state."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So that's another distinction is how long these drugs last."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Another distinction is which of them come from a religious context, have a religion built around them."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "We have this sense that some people are saying that 5MeO DMT and the Sonoran Toad, that they have this long history of indigenous use, but they don't, that's all modern, it's made up, and it's kind of a new approach."}, {"time": 1381,

{"time": 1409, "text": "Aragat on grain and LSD comes from Aragat."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "So I think that there are a lot of ways to look at these different substances."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "Another distinction is which one of them are being researched right now in scientific context and which are not."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And because of the rise of all these for profit companies and everybody's looking for what they can patent, what they can claim, the land grab, more and more there are companies looking at every different kind of psychedelics."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "The ones that are most important that are not being researched, Mescaline, but now there's a company to do Mescaline, the Jernico Lab, Ibogaine, which is crucial for opiate addiction."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "There's a new company, a branch of this company, Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies is making it so that there's just gonna be an enormous amount of investigations into all these different psychedelics."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "But what we're gonna see is the development of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about that have not existed yet because a lot of these for profit companies are gonna wanna invent and patent and have composition of matter patents on new molecules."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Well, you reminded me, I'll get to exactly what you said, but you reminded me of a talk I heard by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And what he talked about is how technology was making things ever smaller, that we are able to pack more and more information into smaller and smaller spaces and that we're developing technologies of communications with people, we now know the internet and things like that."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution of this sort of research would move from this miniaturization to telepathy."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And that was like a shocking thing for somebody like scientific like that to say that."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So will we unlock those parts where I talked about the collective unconscious?"}, {"time": 1593, "text": "Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So I think that that's a possibility."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "There was Stan Groff, who's the world's leading LSD researcher and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "They were talking about stories that they had heard about MDMA that people take and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And so you get this ego dissolution, but underneath it, you have this sense of ego, sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance, kind of grounds it."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry, that you can watch without the terror of the ego dissolution, the sense that you're losing your mind or you're going crazy or you're dying, or that you have this grounded sense of safety while you're dissolving your normal sense of how you see things."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person, as opposed to sort of this manual potion that's through experiment."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Although I don't know about fine tuning things to the person in the sense that we believe there's this inner healer, this kind of inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "We talked about it, the body repairs itself."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "So I think we more need to create safety for people and then what emerges will be customized to what they need to be looking at from this inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "At the same time, we will move to, we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents and you do like personalized chemotherapy."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I think we will have more like personalized psychedelic therapy, but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs that people go through over an extended period of time and then you kind of customize what's next and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations or psilocybin MDMA combinations."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Chemistry is not my strength."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "I'm more into clinical applications and policy, but I can say that from what I've learned from reading from others and research done by others that different psychedelics have an impact on different neurotransmitters, different other parts of energies in the brain."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "The default mode network is what's considered to be like our sense of self and it's part of the brain that sort of is what I described before, scanning the world and filtering information for what's really important to us and both focusing us on things and also helping us to ignore a lot of things."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD and first synthesized psilocybin on what they call structure activity relationships."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "What is the structural molecule and then how do you predict what that new molecule that never existed before is going to do once you actually take it?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And you can get close, but you never really know until you actually take the drug."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And the way that Sasha ran his experiments is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses and he would sort of step up the doses to have more experiences."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "If he thought it was valuable, he'd share it with his wife, Ann, but then what they would do is if they both thought it was valuable, they had a group of 12 people that they were with for many, many years and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people and they would get the different perspectives."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "So there's still a lot of mysteries as far as structure activity relationships and it's not gonna be the case that people go into the lab and they tinker with molecules and they know exactly what they're gonna get."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And a lot of it has to do with not so much chemistry as morphology."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "You could say the shape of the molecule and how does that interact with receptor sites."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And so we're getting better at modeling all of that."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And how does that interaction relate to the morphing of the human experience and deeply understanding that perhaps there's no equations yet for that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And over time and sort of subjective self report, like trying to build an understanding of the effects of the different chemistries."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982 and this was after I had done lots of LSD and mescaline and mushrooms, I was shocked at how different it was than these other substances and yet how profound it was."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So are there whole new kind of categories of classes of drugs that we're not aware of that would be not so much this like eco dissolution or emotional?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala, the fear processing part of the brain."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy throughout the brain in a different way."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "So you think more logically, that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "The other thing it does is it increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So it helps facilitate processing of things into longterm memory."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past, it's always about to happen."},

Bronx VA, and she's done some studies that are with the epigenetics of trauma."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children, and she has identified epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is passed from generation to the generations."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Sort of like set points for anxiety, fear, certain things like that."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "But the question is, can you actually transmit memories from one generation to the next?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "Now, this is not DNA changes which happen over a very long period of time and evolutionary scale."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "But within one lifetime, within some experiences, your epigenetics, what turns on the genes or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted."}, {"time":

remarkable."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So what Rachel's gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD and look at these epigenetic markers before and after and see if they change as a consequence of therapy."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals that will be able to bring certain kind of memories to the surface?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "That's not inconceivable."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "The epigenetic angle is fascinating, that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations that lead to memories living from one generation to the other and then bringing those memories to the surface and using that as signal to understand what exactly the psychedelics bring to the surface and not."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "Now, the other portion of that though is culture."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "I mean, culture is where we store all these memories and in the stories that we get passed out."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Especially with a lot of shared, you talk about the Holocaust or World War II, where it's deeply ingrained in the culture, the impact of those events and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives on that particular event create a set of stories that you can plug into."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you that creates a memory that's connected to, like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust, I think about my own family, but in some sense, it's also resonating with stories of many others."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So it's like somehow the two echo each other and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "The meat of the stories are probably those that are shared with others."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "It's plugging into the collective unconscious."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "That's really fascinating, really plugging into like precisely plugging into particular memories as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "Yeah, I'll just add that the most important dream of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor telling me that he was miraculously saved from death and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose, but he never knew what that purpose was."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed and then he shows me whatever happened to him during the Holocaust."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "And then we're back in the room on his deathbed and he says, well, I know what my purpose was now."}, {"time": 2240, "text":

manifested in this dream."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And that was this story about how people can be incredibly vicious and can be very motivated by irrational factors."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And so I just feel that this kind of multi generational transmission of this story of the irrational being a murderous factor and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained."}, {"time": 2295,

is the whole full range of things."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "I don't know if you can comment about the DMT trip itself and what it's like, starting from the very basic geometric shapes and then launching yourself into the context of the enormity of space and time in the human history."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "Is there anything else to be said about that kind of visually or physically or emotionally about that journey?"}, {"time": 2522, "text": "What it's like, that brief journey that reveals so much?"}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Well, I was with a group of people."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT, have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes, and everybody else was just chatting, and then the person who did the DMT would come back and tell their story of what happened."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And then we'd think about it for a bit and then pass the pipe to the next person."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And so this was like a whole evening."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "So even the, sorry to interrupt, even the conversations themselves then is part of the experience."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Exactly, yes, yes, because it's also what you bring back."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "It's not so much about what the experience is, but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "And then also, how do you learn how to do these things on your own without the drugs?"}, {"time": 2574, "text": "There is this way, because we're saying it's sort of a core human experience, the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And once you've seen it and felt it, then you have a little bit better sense to recreate it on your own."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "Although, I've had dreams where I've been doing LSD and tripping and it was just incredible."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "It was, I was tripping in my dreams, but I had not taken LSD."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So there's this way in which we do that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I would say that from the DMT experience, the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at with this, the group of us and this group of friends trying to do this common exploration, that if you have this sense of safety, you're incredibly vulnerable because you are giving up your awareness really of what's happening around you."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I think there's, what we're finding is that in our psychedelic research for PTSD and what we see with the vaccines, that even African Americans are reluctant to volunteer for vaccines because they haven't had that sense of safety from the medical establishment."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So the overlay has to be this sense of safety as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "And so one of the, Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work on helping people in prison with trauma, potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "But one of the exercises was teaching people to, okay, here's how you deal with stress, just close your eyes and deep breathe."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes in prison, you don't feel safe to do that."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So all that is just to say is that the context is the most important factor."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "So while I'll talk about the DMT experience, the context was this supportive sense of safety that I could be completely vulnerable and out of any kind of controlled women, I think often are less safe in this way than men because of all the sexual assaults."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline to some extent, it opens you up to much more."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And to make a bigger point of that, we could say that it's very similar to the Copernican revolution."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "And people thought that the earth was the center of the universe and the inquisition murdered people that questioned that."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Father Bruno burned at the stake."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Actually, one of the things he said, I think that's worth all these years later saying is that when the inquisition sentenced him to burn at the stake for espousing this idea that the earth was not really the center of the universe, he said to the inquisition, he said, your fear in sentencing me is greater than my fear in being sentenced."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "That their worldview was so rigid that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego is the center of the universe."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "And to realize that we are just rotating about on something much bigger than our individual life."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "Our ego is designed almost to protect this body while we're alive."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "And you can understand all the good reasons why that is, but it also disconnects us from this bigger reality."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "And so the psychedelics, DMT, by knocking this sort of ego orientation or the default mode network offline, you open up to the bigger sweeps of history."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "So in that place of safety and vulnerability in that fascinating group of people, when their ego was dissolved in this way, did they have similar experiences?"}, {"time": 2829, "text": "Is there different places that their minds went?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience that Hitler's part of me, no one else in the group had that."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before or they realized that they're not just the good, the white hat, good people and that they're all good and we got to fight against the bad people."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So no, people will go in different places."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And not only that, if you do it again, you'll go into a different place than you went to the first time."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Unless you have not resolved the issue."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult, but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum, the same challenge that I was unable to overcome."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving, letting the ego fully go."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And I would have this sequence of trips over a couple of months where I would reach this point where I was too scared to move forward and I would just be holding on."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "So there are repeated themes sometimes."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful, is that the full expression of an emotion is the funeral pyre of that emotion."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And what that means is if you can fully let in something, then the essence of life has changed, is that it moves on, that everything's in motion."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And if you can fully experience it, even if it's a sense that you're gonna be trapped in eternity in this hellish state, if you surrender to that, that's the way out."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "This full experience of something is this funeral pyre of that emotion."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And so that runs against a lot of what modern psychiatry is doing too, which is to suppress symptoms."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "Instead of supporting people to kind of explore these insecurities so that then they can contain them and then they can move on."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "Although one of the reasons why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA or why there's advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience is that you have a lot of opportunities to come up against this resistance that may be too difficult to deal with and then you kind of push it aside and then a couple hours later you come back to it or you come back to it."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Press snooze every once in a while if you're not ready."},

5141, "text": "What I didn't know when I started MAPS, and it took me quite a few years, I didn't even know this till about eight, nine years ago, was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill to

generic."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And that will effectively be, well, it's five years, you do pediatric studies, you get six months extension, and we are being required, if we succeed in adults, to

give us money forever because we can make money selling MDMA, but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, but the other is marketing drugs."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "When you market it with the profit maximization motive, we end up in the extreme getting the distortions that we have in America, where we have the

modification of capitalism that's called the benefit corporation, where you maximize public benefit, not profit."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "You still make a profit."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "So selling MDMA for a profit is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit because it's taxable, it's a business."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "So we've created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation,

profit, but maximize benefit for society."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Although there still will be profits, and the profits that we're gonna make are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS, which

insurance companies will cover it."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "But there's the possibility of somewhere in the range of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits during this period of data

marijuana."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "So what we see is that medicalization, by demonstrating that under certain contexts, the risks are much less than the benefits, and then there are benefits, and

side effects in animals?"}, {"time": 6000, "text": "Where do you see the risks?"}, {"time": 6001, "text": "And then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "And phase

potential medical value there."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic that you don't have phase one studies in healthy volunteers."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "That's like phase one slash two, where you bring in the patients, but you still are doing sort of dose response safety studies, but you use patients."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "But most phase one studies are

do these drugs work?"}, {"time": 6058, "text": "Phase two, you're trying to figure out what they do, who your patient population is, what are the risks, who do you include, who do you exclude, what

phase two."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "That's a big challenge for psychedelic drugs."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect, how do you do a double blind study?"},

6096, "text": "And the researcher is not aware."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "And so for that lack of awareness, when the effect is really strong, it's very difficult to do on both the researcher and the

to market the drug."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "Now, for us, when we started MAPS in 86, as I said, it was one year after the criminalization of MDMA in 85, we had five different protocols that were

phase two meeting with FDA."}, {"time": 6205, "text": "So it took 30 years from the start of MAPS to the end of phase two meeting with FDA."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And what we had discovered during phase two was several different key points."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "The drugs that are available right now for PTSD, the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil, that have been approved by FDA and regulators in

MDMA assisted therapy works just as well in men or women, and it works in combat related PTSD."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD."}, {"time": 6276, "text": "So there are risks of MDMA, but we discovered that in a therapeutic setting, we can control all those risks, those things don't happen at all."}, {"time": 6284, "text": "So we discovered safety, we could demonstrate safety."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "We also figured out that our measure, the CAPS, the Clinician Administrative PTSD Scale, that it's the gold standard all over the world for measuring PTSD symptoms, it's what the FDA and the EMA require."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "We discovered that it was a good measure for us and that we could show changes in that."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "What we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA, that people do score fairly high on the scales of mystical experience, not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics, but they do score pretty high on average."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "And a significant number of them have over the cutoff for what would be considered a full mystical experience."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "So enough to say that we could look at a correlation and we didn't find any."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "The other thing that we discovered, and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally, is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School, a big part of it was on the, it's about the regulation of the medical use of psychedelics in marijuana."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "A big part of my dissertation was how to do the double blind study."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And I thought I'd solve the problem and I persuaded my dissertation committee that I'd solve the problem."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "And everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA, most of these people have never done it before, they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "And then the challenge is to pick a dose that's high enough so that there is this confusion, but not so high that it's so therapeutic that we can't tell the difference between the groups."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams, 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 125 and 150."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong and that there is no good solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "What we found is that, to our surprise actually, was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "We didn't think that."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "I mean, the normal dose is like, full dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "But 75 milligrams was an effective dose."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "And we discovered that the lower doses, so I was half right, you could say, the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50, they could produce enough confusion that you could say that they were successful at blinding, not perfectly, but enough confusion so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "But what we discovered, again, to our surprise, was that the low doses made people uncomfortable."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "And so people still got better with the therapy with low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo, they did even better than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "So we call it an anti therapeutic effect."}, {"time": 6521, "text": "I don't mean to imply that they got worse, but it made people uncomfortable."}, {"time": 6525, "text": "People didn't like it."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "But we would still help them make some progress."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So we had the blinding, but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "And so the real question is, if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?"}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So we went to the FDA, and so this was what we discovered during phase two."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting, and we said, we can give you blinding, but it will make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "That will cause a problem because most people will be able to tell what they've got."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "What Tom Loughran, a doctor who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA is our main advisor."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So the first thing he said is that the double blind fails in practice a lot, even with SSRIs, because there's certain side effects that you have with these drugs."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "And the doctors who are doing these research when you're reporting your side effects, they can say, oh, that's probably, you got the active drug instead of the placebo."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So the double blind is in theory is terrific, but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches that they think are important to reduce bias."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "The first one is easy to do."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "It's called random assignment."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "So sometimes there are studies where you'll treat a bunch of people with something and some fraction of them will get better and some won't."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better, who volunteers to get this new treatment?"}, {"time": 6631, "text": "And then you give them the new treatment, but the people that volunteer are more likely to wanna get better."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "They're not representative sample of everybody that has."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "So when you have random assignment, everybody is similarly motivated and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "So that's what we told, of course we need random assignment."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "The other part was when the bias double blind doesn't work as well, then the system of independent raters is especially important of how you do that."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them, and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests to make sure that they evaluate this, so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient and then they're supposed to rate them according to their symptoms."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And then we sort of make sure that we've got this calibrated rater pool and it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine, and they're randomly assigned to the next person that needs a rating."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "So they said 20 raters."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "So we've got like 20 raters and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater sees each patient only once, maybe twice, but not tracking them through the study."}, {"time": 6707, "text": "So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters that they don't know where this person is in the study."}, {"time": 6714, "text": "And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple, who's like the old wise man at the FDA."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "He's been there since 1972."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy and they brought him into the final meeting of this process where we are trying to design phase three."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three, that was November 29th, 2016, we then negotiated for eight months on the design of phase three and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "This process of design."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "To the extent that I have any artistic creativity, it's in protocol design."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "I really love that."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So you enjoy this process."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "I love it because it's always trade offs and I acknowledge that we are all biased."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And so how do you, there's something beautiful about the scientific process designed to get you to the truth."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Especially when that scientific process is trying to get to the truth of the human organism, which is so complicated."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So it's very difficult to dissect, to get the strong effects."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "And when you're analyzing, when you have like raters, they're watching a video."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "Yeah, very much so."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "And so we came to this agreement with FDA though that we would use this independent rater pool."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so we learned in phase two again, that the double blind, there was no solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in the end agreed that the best design was therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA, accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "Most therapists will be able to tell the difference, but that makes a harder test for us to show a difference between the two groups because we're giving them inactive placebo and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "So once we started phase three, so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out was the results of our first phase three study."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "We came to agreement with FDA that we would do two phase three studies, each would have 100 persons in them."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "And what the FDA said to us is that they thought that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers than they wanted to see for safety."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "The reason they said that is it in phase two, we had a large effect size."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "So from a statistical point of view, the bigger of an effect that you're looking for, the fewer number of people you need to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "When you're trying to find small differences, you need large numbers of people to sort of work out the noise."}, {"time": 6899, "text": "So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "And the idea is that it's very possible that the first study would show the efficacy because the effect is so strong."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "So one of the things we also realized when you work with a highly stigmatized drug in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition that we need highly sympathetic subjects and we need to make the best case we can, which means we need to work with the hardest cases so that this is really needed."}, {"time": 6938, "text": "And so we end up enrolling people."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "The first study was chronic severe PTSD."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "And unlike many studies of PTSD, we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "So we have multiple people that have tried to kill themselves that we felt like if we were to exclude them, what are we doing?"}, {"time": 6958, "text": "Those are the people that need it the most."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "So we came to this agreement with FDA."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients, including those that had attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And we would do these two 100 person studies."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis."}, {"time": 6979, "text": "So what that means is that when the study is underway, and often big, big studies, they have this kind of interim analysis where what you do is, and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people had reached the primary outcome measure and all 100 had been enrolled, then we would take a look at the data."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "And if the statistical analysis that we did was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose based on what we saw in phase two, the interim analysis is for what's called sample size reestimation."}, {"time": 7019, "text": "So what it means is if the results aren't as good as you thought they would, you can add more people."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "And then you'll get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it, but FDA will still approve it because FDA also believes that these are group averages."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "There may be some people that will later figure out respond better than others."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant, even if it has a low effect size."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "The SSRIs have low effect size."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "And what we discovered to our delight was that we did not need to add any subjects."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "That's all we were told."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "We weren't told like, what is the results?"}, {"time": 7065, "text": "We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero, or you need to add X numbers of people to the study to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "That's right around the time that COVID hit and lockdowns happened."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "And we ended up negotiating with FDA that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "It took a while for us to end up doing that."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "So the paper that we just published is on the results of 90 people."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "I think it was 46 in the MDMA group, 44 in the placebo group."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "And what we discovered was that the study worked better than we had even hoped."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "So the first thing is that you look at statistical significance."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "You have to get 0.05, which basically means a nickel out of a dollar, a one in 20 chance that the difference between the two groups is due to some random factor rather than to your intervention."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy and then with inactive placebo and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "So you have to get 0.05."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "There's another measure that the FDA uses sometimes called robust, which means one in a thousand, instead of one in 20, one in a thousand."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "And if you get a robust results, 0.001, and you meet some other criteria, they might agree to approve the drug on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "Because when you think about it, a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study, a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study, you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "So that's pretty good."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "So robust 0.001 is even better than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "Outrageous, incredibly."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "So that's a measure of both the difference between the two groups and the variability."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability, that most people who got the MDA got quite a large amount of benefit from it."}, {"time": 7203, "text": "And most people who got the placebo were more or less in the same range as well."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "That's really exciting, by the way."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "I mean, I suppose it's exciting from a perspective of approval by the FDA."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it, but it's also exciting because it has a chance to help people that are truly suffering, yeah."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "Well, if we can get one in 10,000 in the first phase three study, chances are we can get one in 20 in the second."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "So it's really gonna be about safety for us in the second phase three study."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance, but you could have an effect that's not very significant."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "It's not clinically significant."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "You can have statistical significance without clinical significance."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And as I said, the more people you get in the study, you can find smaller and smaller differences between two groups."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size."}, {"time": 7267, "text": "So effect size is based on... That scale you mentioned?"}, {"time": 7271, "text": "Well, the scale of the effect size is based on standard deviations."}, {"time": 7277, "text": "So an effect size of one means that your results are one standard deviation away from the norm."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "That's considered very large."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size, that's considered small effect size."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "Medium is starting to be around 0.6 and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "There's two different ways to look at it."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference between your two groups."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And what that is for us, since one group had therapy and one had therapy plus MDMA, the placebo subtracted effect size is basically the effect of just the MDMA because you've kind of washed out the therapy."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "That was 0.91."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "So we had a large effect size, which was different."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Now, when we do the within group, meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy, look at their baseline and their outcomes."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "That's another way to look at it."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "That's 2.1 effect size."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "Two standard deviations away from the norm is enormous effect size."}, {"time": 7358, "text": "The other part is that we had no effect by site, which is very important."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada, 11 throughout the United States."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?"}, {"time": 7373, "text": "Because what that might mean is maybe you've got all your patients or most of your patients going to this one site, which is these highly experienced therapists and they're like hippies from way back and they're super experienced with psychedelics and they're getting great results, but nobody else gets good results."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "So we had no effect by site."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "That we've been able to train all these new therapists."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "We also discovered that there's a group that's considered to be very difficult to treat, which is called the dissociative subtype."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So when people are traumatized, one of the ways to psychologically survive that is you dissociate."}, {"time": 7418, "text": "It's like you're not there."}, {"time": 7421, "text": "When you do that though, it's hard to come back because when you come back, then you get all these painful memories and fearful."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "And so the extreme of that is called dissociative identity disorder, kind of like

progress that we've made."}, {"time": 8473, "text": "On the other hand, turning things over to profit maximizing companies, the big concern is that they're gonna try to minimize the amount of therapy

this is S ketamine by Johnson and Johnson for depression."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "And it's done by a profit maximizing company."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy or psychotherapy at all."}, {"time": 8504, "text": "And so they've gotten approval for S ketamine on the basis of it's just a pharmacological treatment and it's not delivered with therapy, the results fade pretty quickly, so you need to get more ketamine."}, {"time": 8519, "text": "And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits for the pharmaceutical company, but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "What we're seeing though in these various clinics that are being set up is that a lot of people are realizing that it works better with therapy."}, {"time": 8537, "text": "And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists so that when they provide therapy, they're making more money and then you need less ketamine."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine that's been patented for depression and they sell it for hundreds of dollars, but ketamine itself is one of the world's essential medicines."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "It's off patent, it's been around for a long time, it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "And it's only a few bucks because it's generic."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying, great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson, you've helped demonstrate that ketamine is good for depression, but we're not gonna buy it from you."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "We're gonna buy it for a few bucks and we're gonna add therapy to it."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "Now there's a bunch of ketamine mills you could say that are just prescribing the ketamine and people are making a lot of money there."}, {"time": 8587, "text": "So I am worried about that."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "I think the best thing that we can do is create an alternative narrative, a different kind of example."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "We can lead by example."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "We can't make for profit companies into benefit corporations unless they wanna do that."}, {"time": 8603, "text": "We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "But if we create an example of something that's different, the hope is that people will gravitate towards that and some of the other companies."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "Like even now we have Exxon and other these companies, oil companies saying, oh, we're big into alternative energy and we're, you know."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "And that starts with companies that show an example that then communicates to the public that this is something exciting and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "The public demands it and you could say the same thing for the public demanding the big pharma to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit and maybe giving power to the therapists, more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors that ultimately want."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "I think incentives are interesting, but I think doctors ultimately care more because they're in direct contact with humans."}, {"time": 8667, "text": "They want to make people better."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "It's not, you know, sure they wanna make money, but they ultimately want to make people feel better because they get to look at people and it's so joyful to make people feel better at the end of the day."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "So giving more power to them is also perhaps one of the ways that you then incentivize the pharma companies that are trying to do good because the doctors will choose those companies."}, {"time": 8693, "text": "Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA for 10 or 20 bucks on your own and we've trained people on here's our therapeutic method, here is our ways for peer support, then people have an alternative from buying it from the pharma companies."}, {"time": 8715, "text": "So most of the for profit companies have come to this conclusion that drug policy reform is bad for their business model."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "I think they're making a fundamental mistake."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "And I think the reason is that the more that we de stigmatize this, the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach, even when people can get it on their own and do it with their friends or do it with themselves, there's gonna be even more people that say, oh my God, I've got real serious issues."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "I would rather go to trained professionals covered by insurance."}, {"time": 8749, "text": "And I think it'll increase the business, but most of the for profit companies don't see it that way."},

neural network models of perception and categorization and memory."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And it just blew me out of the water that one could create a model that was simulating neurons, not just

UCSD where we were."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And it was called Parallel Models of Associative Memory."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And it brought all the people together who had been thinking about these kinds of ideas in 1979 or 1980."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And this began to kind of really resonate with some of Rumelhart's own thinking, some of his reasons for wanting something other than the kinds of computation he'd been doing so far."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So let me talk about Rumelhart now for a minute, OK, with that context."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Well, let me also just pause because he said so many interesting things before we go to Rumelhart."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So first of all, for people who are not familiar, neural networks are at the core of the machine learning, deep learning revolution of today."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Geoffrey Hinton that we mentioned is one of the figures that were important in the history like yourself in the development of these neural networks, artificial neural networks that are then used for the machine learning application."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Like I mentioned, the backpropagation paper is one of the optimization mechanisms by which these networks can learn."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And the word parallel is really interesting."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "So it's almost like synonymous from a computational perspective how you thought at the time about neural networks as parallel computation."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Would that be fair to say?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Well, yeah, the parallel, the word parallel in this comes from the idea that each neuron is an independent computational unit, right?"}, {"time": 1473, "text": "It gathers data from other neurons, it integrates it in a certain way, and then it produces a result."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And it's a very simple little computational unit."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "But it's autonomous in the sense that it does its thing, right?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "It's in a biological medium where it's getting nutrients and various chemicals from that medium."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But you can think of it as almost like a little computer in and of itself."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "So the idea is that each our brains have, oh, look, 100 or hundreds, almost a billion of these little neurons, right?"}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And they're all capable of doing their work at the same time."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So it's like instead of just a single central processor that's engaged in chug one step after another, we have a billion of these little computational units working at the same time."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So at the time that's, I don't know, maybe you can comment, it seems to me, even still to me, quite a revolutionary way to think about computation relative to the development of theoretical computer science alongside of that where it's very much like sequential computer."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're analyzing algorithms that are running on a single computer."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "You're saying, wait a minute, why don't we take a really dumb, very simple computer and just have a lot of them interconnected together?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And they're all operating in their own little world and they're communicating with each other and thinking of computation that way."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "And from that kind of computation, trying to understand how things like certain characteristics of the human mind can emerge."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "That's quite a revolutionary way of thinking, I would say."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Well, yes, I agree with you."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And there's still this sort of sense of not sort of knowing how we kind of get all the way there, I think."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And this very much remains at the core of the questions that everybody's asking about the capabilities of deep learning and all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "But if I could just play this out a little bit, a convolutional neural network or a CNN, which many people may have heard of, is a set of, you could think of it biologically as a set of collections of neurons."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Each collection has maybe 10,000 neurons in it."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "But there's many layers."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "Some of these things are hundreds or even 1,000 layers deep."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "But others are closer to the biological brain and maybe they're like 20 layers deep or something like that."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So within each layer, we have thousands of neurons or tens of thousands maybe."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "Well, in the brain, we probably have millions in each layer."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "But we're getting sort of similar in a certain way."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And then we think, OK, at the bottom level, there's an array of things that are like the photoreceptors."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "In the eye, they respond to the amount of light of a certain wavelength at a certain location on the pixel array."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So that's like the biological eye."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And then there's several further stages going up, layers of these neuron like units."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "And you go from that raw input array of pixels to the classification, you've actually built a system that could do the same kind of thing that you and I do when we open our eyes and we look around and we see there's a cup, there's a cell phone, there's a water bottle."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And these systems are doing that now, right?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "So they are, in terms of the parallel idea that we were talking about before, they are doing this massively parallel computation in the sense that each of the neurons in each of those layers is thought of as computing its little bit of something about the input simultaneously with all the other ones in the same layer."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "We get to the point of abstracting that away and thinking, oh, it's just one whole vector that's being computed, one activation pattern that's computed in a single step."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And that abstraction is useful, but it's still that parallel."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And distributed processing, right?"}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Each one of these guys is just contributing a tiny bit to that whole thing."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And that's the excitement that you felt, that from these simple things, you can emerge."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "When you add these level of abstractions on it, you can start getting all the beautiful things that we think about as cognition."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And so, OK, so you have this conference."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I forgot the name already, but it's Parallel and Something Associative Memory and so on."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Very exciting, technical and exciting title."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And you started talking about Dave Romerhart."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So who is this person that was so, you've spoken very highly of him."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Can you tell me about him, his ideas, his mind, who he was as a human being, as a scientist?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "So Dave came from a little tiny town in Western South Dakota."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "And his mother was the librarian, and his father was the editor of the newspaper."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And I know one of his brothers pretty well."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "They grew up, there were four brothers, and they grew up together."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And their father encouraged them to compete with each other a lot."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "They competed in sports, and they competed in mind games."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "I don't know, things like Sudoku and chess and various things like that."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And Dave was a standout undergraduate."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "He went at a younger age than most people do to college at the University of South Dakota and majored in mathematics."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And I don't know how he got interested in psychology, but he applied to the mathematical psychology program at Stanford and was accepted as a PhD student to study mathematical psychology at Stanford."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So mathematical psychology is the use of mathematics to model mental processes."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So something that I think these days might be called cognitive modeling, that whole space."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "Yeah, it's mathematical in the sense that you say, if this is true and that is true, then I can derive that this should follow."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And so you say, these are my stipulations about the fundamental principles, and this is my prediction about behavior."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And it's all done with equations."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "It's not done with a computer simulation."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So you solve the equation, and that tells you what the probability that the subject will be correct on the seventh trial or the experiment is or something like that."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So it's a use of mathematics to descriptively characterize aspects of behavior."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And Stanford at that time was the place where there were several really, really strong mathematical thinkers who were also connected with three or four others around the country who brought a lot of really exciting ideas onto the table."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And it was a very, very prestigious part of the field of psychology at that time."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So Rummelhart comes into this."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "He was a very strong student within that program."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "And he got this job at this brand new university in San Diego in 1967, where he's one of the first assistant professors in the Department of Psychology at UCSD."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So I got there in 74, seven years later, and Rummelhart at

example, one of his favorite things at that time was, Margie was sitting on the front step when she heard the familiar jingle of the good humor man."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "She remembered her birthday money and ran into the house."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "What is Margie doing?"}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Well, there's a couple of ideas you could have, but the most natural one is that the good humor man brings ice cream."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "She likes ice cream."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "She knows she needs money to buy ice cream, so she's going to run into the house and get her money so she can buy herself an ice cream."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "It's a huge amount of inference that has to happen to get those things to link up with each other."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "And he was interested in how the hell that could happen."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And he was trying to build good old fashioned AI style models of representation of language and content of things like has money."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "So like formal logic and knowledge bases, like that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "So he was integrating that with his thinking about cognition."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "The mechanisms of cognition, how can they mechanistically be applied to build these knowledge, like to actually build something that looks like a web of knowledge and thereby from there emerges something like understanding, whatever the heck that is."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Yeah, he was grappling."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "This was something that they grappled with at the end of that book that I was describing, Explorations in Cognition."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "But he was realizing that the paradigm of good old fashioned AI wasn't giving him the answers to these questions."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "By the way, that's called good old fashioned AI now."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "It wasn't called that at the time."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "Well, it was."},

hadn't really panned out."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And people were beginning to recognize that."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And Rommelhardt was like, yeah, he's part of the recognition that this wasn't all working."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Anyway, so he started thinking in terms of the idea that we needed systems that allowed us to integrate multiple simultaneous constraints in a way that would be mutually influencing each other."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "So he wrote a paper that just really, first time I read it, I said, oh, well, yeah, but is this important?"}, {"time": 2231, "text": "But after a while, it just got under my skin."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "And it was called An Interactive Model of Reading."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "And in this paper, he laid out the idea that every aspect of our interpretation of what's coming off the page when we read at every level of analysis you can think of actually depends on all the other levels of analysis."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So what are the actual pixels making up each letter?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And what do those pixels signify about which letters they are?"}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And what do those letters tell us about what words are there?"}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And what do those words tell us about what ideas the author is trying to convey?"}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And so he had this model where we have these little tiny elements that represent each of the pixels of each of the letters, and then other ones that represent the line segments in them, and other ones that represent the letters, and other ones that represent the words."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And at that time, his idea was there's this set of experts."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "There's an expert about how to construct a line out of pixels, and another expert about which sets of lines go together to make which letters, and another one about which letters go together to make which words, and another one about what the meanings of the words are, and another one about how the meanings fit together, and things like that."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And all these experts are looking at this data, and they're updating hypotheses at other levels."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "So the word expert can tell the letter expert, oh, I think there should be a T there, because I think there should be a word the here."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "And the bottom up sort of feature to letter expert could say, I think there should be a T there, too."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "And if they agree, then you see a T, right?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "And so there's a top down, bottom up interactive process, but it's going on at all layers simultaneously."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So everything can filter all the way down from the top, as well as all the way up from the bottom."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "And it's a completely interactive, bidirectional, parallel distributed process."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "That is somehow, because of the abstractions, it's hierarchical."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "So there's different layers of responsibilities, different levels of responsibilities."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "First of all, it's fascinating to think about it in this kind of mechanistic way."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "So not thinking purely from the structure of a neural network or something like a neural network, but thinking about these little guys that work on letters, and then the letters come words and words become sentences."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And that's a very interesting hypothesis that from that kind of hierarchical structure can emerge understanding."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Yeah, so, but the thing is, though, I wanna just sort of relate this to the earlier part of the conversation."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "When Romelhart was first thinking about it, there were these experts on the side, one for the features and one for the letters and one for how the letters make the words and so on."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And they would each be working, sort of evaluating various propositions about, you know, is this combination of features here going to be one that looks like the letter T and so on."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "And what he realized, kind of after reading Hinton's dissertation and hearing about Jim Anderson's linear algebra based neural network models that I was telling you about before was that he could replace those experts with neuron like processing units, which just would have their connection weights that would do this job."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So what ended up happening was that Romelhart and I got together and we created a model called the interactive activation model of letter perception, which takes these little pixel level inputs, constructs line segment features, letters and words."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But now we built it out of a set of neuron like processing units that are just connected to each other with connection weights."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "So the unit for the word time has a connection to the unit for the letter T in the first position and the letter I in the second position, so on."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And because these connections are bi directional, if you have prior knowledge that it might be the word time that starts to prime the letters and the features."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And if you don't, then it has to start bottom up."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "But the directionality just depends on where the information comes in first."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And if you have context together with features at the same time, they can convergently result in an emergent perception."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And that was the piece of work that we did together that sort of got us both completely convinced that this neural network way of thinking was going to be able to actually address the questions that we were interested in as cognitive psychologists."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "So the algorithmic side, the optimization side, those are all details like when you first start the idea that you can get far with this kind of way of thinking, that in itself is a profound idea."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So do you like the term connectionism to describe this kind of set of ideas?"}, {"time": 2587, "text": "I think it's useful."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "It highlights the notion that the knowledge that the system exploits is in the connections between the units, right?"}, {"time": 2601, "text": "There isn't a separate dictionary."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "There's just the connections between the units."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "So I already sort of laid that on the table with the connections from the letter units to the unit for the word time, right?"}, {"time": 2616, "text": "The unit for the word time isn't a unit for the word time for any other reason than it's got the connections to the letters that make up the word time."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Those are the units on the input that excited when it's excited that it in a sense represents in the system that there's support for the hypothesis that the word time is present in the input."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "But it's not, the word time isn't written anywhere inside the bottle, it's only written there in the picture we drew of the model to say that's the unit for the word time, right?"}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And if somebody wants to tell me, well, how do you spell that word?"}, {"time": 2661, "text": "You have to use the connections from that out to then get those letters, for example."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "That's such a, that's a counterintuitive idea where humans want to think in this logic way."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "This idea of connectionism, it doesn't, it's weird."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "It's weird that this is how it all works."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "Yeah, but let's go back to that CNN, right?"}, {"time": 2686, "text": "That CNN with all those layers of neuron like processing units that we were talking about before, it's gonna come out and say, this is a cat, that's a dog, but it has no idea why it said that."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "It's just got all these connections between all these layers of neurons, like from the very first layer to the, you know, like whatever these layers are, they just get numbered after a while because they, you know, they somehow further in you go, the more abstract the features are, but it's a graded and continuous sort of process of abstraction anyway."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And, you know, it goes from very local, very specific to much more sort of global, but it's still, you know, another sort of pattern of activation over an array of units."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "And then at the output side, it says it's a cat or it's a dog."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "And when I open my eyes and say, oh, that's Lex, or, oh, you know, there's my own dog and I recognize my dog, which is a member of the same species as many other dogs, but I know this one because of some slightly unique characteristics."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "I don't know how to describe what it is that makes me know that I'm looking at Lex or at my particular dog, right?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Or even that I'm looking at a particular brand of car."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "Like I can say a few words about it, but I wrote you a paragraph about the car, you would have trouble figuring out which car is he talking about, right?"}, {"time": 2776, "text": "So the idea that we have propositional knowledge of what it is that allows us to recognize that this is an actual instance of this particular natural kind has always been something that it never worked, right?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "You couldn't ever write down a set of propositions for visual recognition."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And so in that space, it sort of always seemed very natural that something more implicit, you don't have access to what the details of the computation were in between, you just get the result."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So that's the other part of connectionism, you cannot, you don't read the contents of the connections, the connections only cause outputs to occur based on inputs."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "Yeah, and for us that like final layer or some particular layer is very important, the one that tells us that it's our dog or like it's a cat or a dog, but each layer is probably equally as important in the grand scheme of things."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Like there's no reason why the cat versus dog is more important than the lower level activations, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "I mean, all of it is just this beautiful stacking on top of each other."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And we humans live in this particular layers, for us it's useful to survive, to use those cat versus dog, predator versus prey, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "It's fascinating that it's all continuous, but then you then ask, the history of artificial intelligence, you ask, are we able to introspect and convert the very things that allow us to tell the difference between cat and dog into a logic, into formal logic?"}, {"time": 2885, "text": "That's been the dream."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "I would say that's still part of the dream of symbolic AI."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And I've recently talked to Doug Lenat who created Psych and that's a project that lasted for many decades and still carries a sort of dream in it, right?"}, {"time": 2908, "text": "But we still don't know the answer, right?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "It seems like connectionism is really powerful, but it also seems like there's this building of knowledge."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "And so how do we, how do you square those two?"}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Like, do you think the connections can contain the depth of human knowledge and the depth of what Dave Romahart was thinking about of understanding?"}, {"time": 2931, "text": "Well, that remains the $64 question."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And I... With inflation, that number is higher."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "Okay, $64,000."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Maybe it's the $64 billion question now."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "You know, I think that from the emergentist side, which, you know, I placed myself on."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So I used to sometimes tell people I was a radical, eliminative connectionist because I didn't want them to think that I wanted to build like anything into the machine."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "But I don't like the word eliminative anymore because it makes it seem like it's wrong to think that there is this emergent level of understanding."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And I disagree with that."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "So I think, you know, I would call myself an a radical emergentist connectionist rather than eliminative connectionist, right?"}, {"time": 3009, "text": "Because I want to acknowledge that these higher level kinds of aspects of our cognition are real, but they're not, they don't exist as such."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And there was an example that Doug Hofstadter used to use that I thought was helpful in this respect."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "Just the idea that we can think about sand dunes as entities and talk about like how many there are even."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "But we also know that a sand dune is a very fluid thing."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "It's a pile of sand that is capable of moving around under the wind and reforming itself in somewhat different ways."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "And that's where I think the connectionist feeds into the cognitive."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's like, okay, so if the substrate is parallel distributed connectionist, then it doesn't mean that the contents of thought isn't like abstract and symbolic, but it's more fluid maybe than it's easier to capture with a set of logical expressions."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "Yeah, that's a heck of a sort of thing to put at the top of a resume, radical, emergentist, connectionist."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So there is, just like you said, a beautiful dance between that, between the machinery of intelligence, like the neural network side of it, and the stuff that emerges."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "I mean, the stuff that emerges seems to be, I don't know, I don't know what that is, that it seems like maybe all of reality is emergent."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "What I think about, this is made most distinctly rich to me when I look at cellular automata, look at game of life, that from very, very simple things, very rich, complex things emerge that start looking very quickly like organisms that you forget how the actual thing operates."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "They start looking like they're moving around, they're eating each other, some of them are generating offspring."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "You forget very quickly."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "And it seems like maybe it's something about the human mind that wants to operate in some layer of the emergent, and forget about the mechanism of how that emergence happens."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "So it, just like you are in your radicalness, I'm also, it seems like unfair to eliminate the magic of that emergent, like eliminate the fact that that emergent is real."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Yeah, no, I agree."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "I'm not, that's why I got rid of eliminative, right?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "Eliminative, yeah."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "Yeah, because it seemed like that was trying to say that it's all completely like."}, {"time": 3241,

that philosophically many people have confronted that possibility over time, but it's still important to accept it as magic, right?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "So, I think of Fellini in this context, I think of others who have appreciated the role of magic, the role of magic, of actual trickery in creating illusions that move us."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And Plato was on to this too."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "It's like somehow or other these shadows give rise to something much deeper than that."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "And that's, so we won't try to figure out what it is."}, {"time": 3301,

patient being unable to differentiate like similar breeds of dog or remember the lower frequency unfamiliar categories that they used to be able to remember."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "But as it progresses, it becomes more and more striking and the patient loses the ability to recognize things like pigs and goats and sheep and calls all middle sized animals dogs and can't recognize rabbits

dogs."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "This is just a part of the syndrome though."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "The patient loses the ability to relate concepts to each other."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So my collaborator in this work, Carolyn Patterson, developed a test called the pyramids and palm trees test."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "So you give the patient a picture of pyramids and they have a choice which goes with the pyramids, palm trees or pine trees."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "And she showed that this wasn't just a matter of language because the patient's loss of this ability shows up whether you present the material with words or with pictures."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "The pictures, they can't put the pictures together with each other properly anymore."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "They

the differences."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So the difference between the dog and the goat is no longer part of the pattern anymore."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And since dog is really familiar, that's

think about how, you know, learning occurs in a neural network."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And he said, the problem with the way you guys have been approaching this is that you've been looking for inspiration from biology to tell you what the rules should be for how the synapses should change the strengths of their connections, how the connections should form."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "He said, that's the wrong way to go about it."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "What you should do is you should think in terms of how you can adjust connection weights to solve a problem."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "So you define your problem and then you figure out how the adjustment of the connection weights will solve the problem."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "And Rumelhart heard that and said to himself, okay, so I'm going to start thinking about it that way."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "I'm going to essentially imagine that I have some objective function, some goal of the computation."},

connection weights so as to minimize my loss or reduce the error."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "And that's called, you know, gradient descent."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And engineers were already familiar with the concept of gradient descent."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "And in fact, there was an algorithm called the delta rule that had been invented by a professor in the electrical engineering

"We want the output to produce a certain pattern."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "We can define the difference between our target and what the neural network is producing."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "And we can figure out how to change the connection weights to reduce that error."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "So what Romilhar did was to generalize that so as to be able to change the connections from earlier layers of units to the ones at a hidden layer between the input and the output."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "And so he first called the algorithm the generalized delta rule because it's just an extension of the gradient descent idea."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And interestingly enough, Hinton was thinking that this wasn't going to work very well."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "So Hinton had his own alternative algorithm at the time based on the concept of the Boltzmann machine that he was pursuing."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "So the paper on the Boltzmann machine came out in, learning in Boltzmann machines came out in 1985."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "But it turned out that back prop worked better than the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "So this generalized delta algorithm ended up being called back propagation, as you say, back prop."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "And probably that name is opaque to me."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "What it meant was that in order to figure out what the changes you needed to make to the connections from the input to the hidden layer, you had to back propagate the error signals from the output layer through the connections from the hidden layer to the output to get the signals that would be the error signals for the hidden layer."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And that's how Rumelhart formulated it."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "It was like, well, we know what the error signals are at the output layer."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "Let's see if we can get a signal at the hidden layer that tells each hidden unit what its error signal is essentially."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "So it's back propagating through the connections from the hidden to the output to get the signals to tell the hidden units how to change their weights from the input."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "And that's why it's called back prop."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "But so it came from Hinton having introduced the concept of, you know, define your objective function, figure out how to take the derivative so that you can adjust the connections so that they make progress towards your goal."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "So stop thinking about biology for a second and let's start to think about optimization and computation a little bit more."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "So what about Jeff Hinton?"}, {"time": 4395, "text": "You've gotten a chance to work with him in that little thing."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "The set of people involved there is quite incredible."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "The small set of people under the PDP flag, it's just given the amount of impact those ideas have had over the years, it's kind of incredible to think about."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "But, you know, just like you said, like yourself, Jeffrey Hinton is seen as one of the, not just like a seminal figure in AI, but just a brilliant person, just like the horsepower of the mind is pretty high up there for him because he's just a great thinker."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So what kind of ideas have you learned from him?"}, {"time": 4437, "text": "Have you influenced each other on?"}, {"time": 4439, "text": "Have you debated over what stands out to you in the full space of ideas here at the intersection of computation and cognition?"}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Well, so Jeff has said many things to me that had a profound impact on my thinking."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And he's written several articles which were way ahead of their time."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "He had two papers in 1981, just to give one example, one of which was essentially the idea of transformers and another of which was an early paper on semantic cognition which inspired him and Rumelhart and me throughout the 80s and, you know, still I think sort of grounds my own thinking about the semantic aspects of cognition."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "He also, in a small paper that was never published that he wrote in 1977, you know, before he actually arrived at UCSD or maybe a couple years even before that, I don't know, when he was a PhD student, he described how a neural network could do recursive computation."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "And it was a very clever idea that he's continued to explore over time, which was sort of the idea that when you call a subroutine, you need to save the state that you had when you called it so you can get back to where you were when you're finished with the subroutine."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "And the idea was that you would save the state of the calling routine by making fast changes to connection weights."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "And then when you finished with the subroutine call, those fast changes in the connection weights would allow you to go back to where you had been before and reinstate the previous context so that you could continue on with the top level of the computation."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "Anyway, that was part of the idea."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "And I always thought, okay, that's really, you know, he had extremely creative ideas that were quite a lot ahead of his time and many of them in the 1970s and early 1980s."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "So another thing about Geoff Hinton's way of thinking, which has profoundly influenced my effort to understand human mathematical cognition, is that he doesn't write too many equations."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "And people tell stories like, oh, in the Hinton Lab meetings, you don't get up at the board and write equations like you do in everybody else's machine learning lab."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "What you do is you draw a picture."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "And, you know, he explains aspects of the way deep learning works by putting his hands together and showing you the shape of a ravine and

too big a jump, you're going to jump to the other side."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And so that's why we have to turn down the learning rate, for example."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "And it speaks to me of the fundamentally intuitive character of deep insight together with a commitment to really understanding in a way that's absolutely ultimately explicit and clear, but also intuitive."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Yeah, there's certain people like that."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "Here's an example, some kind of weird mix of visual and intuitive and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "Feynman is another example, different style of thinking, but very unique."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "And when you're around those people, for me in the engineering realm, there's a guy named

collaborations throughout the history of science."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "That's the magic of that."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "It's not always the exact ideas that you talk about, but it's the process of generating those ideas."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "Being around that, spending time with that human being, you can come up with some brilliant work, especially when it's cross disciplinary

{"time": 4783, "text": "And together with the deeply intuitive thinking ability that he has, he also has, it's been clear, he's described this to me, and I think he's mentioned it from time to time in other interviews that he's had with people."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "He's wanted to be able to sort of think of himself as contributing to the understanding of reasoning itself, not just human reasoning."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "Like Boole is about logic, right?"}, {"time": 4825, "text": "It's about what can we conclude from what else and how do we formalize that."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "And as a computer scientist, logician, philosopher, the goal is to understand how we derive truths from other, from givens and things like this."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And the work that Jeff was doing in the early to mid 80s on something called the Bolton machine was his way of connecting with that Boolean tradition and bringing it into the more continuous, probabilistic graded constraint satisfaction realm."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And it was a beautiful set of ideas linked with theoretical physics as well as with logic."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "And it's always been, I mean, I've always been inspired by the Bolton machine too."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "It's like, well, if the neurons are probabilistic rather than deterministic in their computations, then maybe this somehow is part of the serendipity or adventitiousness of the moment of insight, right?"}, {"time": 4913, "text": "It might not have occurred at that particular instant."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "It might be sort of partially the result of a stochastic process."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "And that too is part of the magic of the emergence of some of these things."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "Well, you're right with the Boolean lineage and the dream of computer science is somehow, I mean, I certainly think of humans this way, that humans are one particular manifestation of intelligence, that there's something bigger going on and you're hoping to figure that out."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "The mechanisms of intelligence, the mechanisms of cognition are much bigger than just humans."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "So I think of, I started using the phrase computational intelligence at some point as to characterize the field that I thought, you know, people like Geoff Hinton and many of the people I know at DeepMind are working in and where I feel like I'm, you know, I'm a kind of a human oriented computational intelligence researcher in that I'm actually kind of interested in the human solution."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "But at the same time, I feel like that's where a huge amount of the excitement of deep learning actually lies is in the idea that, you know, we may be able to even go beyond what we can achieve with our own nervous systems when we build computational intelligences that are, you know, not limited in the ways that we are by our own biology."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "Perhaps allowing us to scale the very mechanisms of human intelligence just increases power through scale."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "And I think that that, you know, obviously that's the, that's being played out massively at Google Brain, at OpenAI and to some extent at DeepMind as well."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "I guess I shouldn't say to some extent."}, {"time": 5054, "text":

as many synapses and neurons as the human brain."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "So we still got, we're still beating them on that."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "We humans are beating the AIs, but they're catching up pretty quickly."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "You write about modeling of mathematical cognition."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "So let me first ask about mathematics in general."}, {"time":

"Well, I think of mathematics as a set of tools for exploring idealized worlds that often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world but need not."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "But they're worlds in which objects exist with idealized properties and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision so as to allow the implications of certain facts to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "So if you have two triangles and you know that there is an angle in the first one that has the same measure as an angle in the second

conclude that the triangles are congruent."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "That is to say they have all of their properties in common."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "And that is something about triangles."},

launched from the planet Earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out in way beyond Pluto somewhere at exactly a predicted time and date is something that depends on these ideas."},

idealized objects, these triangles or these distances or these points, whatever they are, that allow for this set of tools to be created that then gives human beings this incredible leverage that they didn't have without these concepts."}, {"time": 5331, "text": "And I think this is actually already true when we think about just, you know, the natural numbers."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "I always

one in the same time sort of abstract and idealized and generalizable, while on the other hand, potentially very, very grounded and concrete."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "And one of the things that makes for the incredible achievements of the human mind is the fact that humans invented these idealized systems that leverage the power of human thought in such a way as to allow all this kind of thing to happen."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And so that's what mathematics to me is the development of systems for thinking about the properties and relations among sets of idealized objects and the mathematical notation system that we unfortunately focus way too much on is just our way of expressing propositions about these properties."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "It's just like we're talking with

model?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "The insights that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of the intuitive kind of connectionist like knowledge that makes it so that something is

with this formal system."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "So I think of the ability of somebody like Hinton or Newton or Einstein or Rumelhart or Poincare to Archimedes is another example."}, {"time": 5661,

that allow me to make it rigorous and certain?"}, {"time": 5701, "text": "And so I feel like the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of hope or encouragement that ultimately it'll all happen."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "So in particular as many people now have become really interested in thinking about, you know,

as a paradigm."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And what I find interesting is the idea that the ability to become a person who is capable of thinking in this abstract formal way is a result of the same

it's, but, you know, one of the things that we found with hand presence, right?"}, {"time": 639, "text": "So the earliest VR, you just have the headset and then, and that was cool, you could look around, you feel like you're in a place, but you don't feel like you're really able to interact with it until you have hands."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And then there was this big question where once you got hands, what's the right way to represent them?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "And initially, all of our assumptions was, okay, when I look down and see my hands in the physical world, I see an arm and it's gonna be super weird if you see, you know, just your hand."}, {"time": 666, "text": "But it turned out to not be the case because there's this issue with your arms, which is like, what's your elbow angle?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "And if the elbow angle that we're kind of interpolating based on where your hand is and where your headset is actually isn't accurate, it creates this very uncomfortable feeling where it's like, oh, like my arm is actually out like this, but it's like showing it in here."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And that actually broke the feeling of presence a lot more."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Whereas it turns out that if you just show the hands and you don't show the arms, it actually is fine for people."}, {"time": 696, "text": "So I think that there's a bunch of these interesting psychological cues where it'll be more about getting the right details right."}, {"time": 704, "text": "And I think a lot of that will be possible even over a few year period or a five year period."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And we won't need like every single thing to be solved to deliver this like full sense of presence."}, {"time": 714, "text": "Yeah, it's a fascinating psychology question of what is the essence that makes in person conversation special?"}, {"time": 724, "text": "It's like emojis are able to convey emotion really well, even though they're obviously not photorealistic."}, {"time": 730, "text": "And so in that same way, Jessica, you're saying, just showing the hands is able to create a comfortable expression with your hands."}, {"time": 738, "text": "So I wonder what that is."}, {"time": 739, "text": "People in the world wars used to write letters and you can fall in love with just writing letters."}, {"time": 744, "text": "You don't need to see each other in person."}, {"time": 746, "text": "You can convey emotion."}, {"time": 747, "text": "You can be depth of experience with just words."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So that's, I think, a fascinating place to explore psychology of like, how do you find that intimacy?"}, {"time": 759, "text": "Yeah, and the way that I come to all of this stuff is, I basically studied psychology and computer science."}, {"time": 765, "text": "So all of the work that I do is sort of at the intersection of those things."}, {"time": 769, "text": "I think most of the other big tech companies are building technology for you to interact with."}, {"time": 775, "text": "What I care about is building technology to help people interact with each other."}, {"time": 778, "text": "So I think it's a somewhat different approach than most of the other tech entrepreneurs and big companies come at this from."}, {"time": 784, "text": "And a lot of the lessons in terms of how I think about designing products come from some just basic elements of psychology, right?"}, {"time": 795, "text": "In terms of our brains, you can compare it to the brains of other animals."}, {"time": 802, "text": "We're very wired to specific things, facial expressions."}, {"time": 805, "text": "I mean, we're very visual, right?"}, {"time": 808, "text": "So compared to other animals, I mean, that's clearly the main sense that most people have."}, {"time": 812, "text": "But there's a whole part of your brain that's just kind of focused on reading facial cues."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So when we're designing the next version of Quest or the VR headset, a big focus for us is face tracking and basically eye tracking so you can make eye contact, which again, isn't really something that you can do over a video conference."}, {"time": 831, "text": "It's sort of amazing how far video conferencing has gotten without the ability to make eye contact, right?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "It's sort of a bizarre thing if you think about it."}, {"time": 840, "text": "You're looking at someone's face, sometimes for an hour when you're in a meeting and you looking at their eyes to them doesn't look like you're looking at their eyes."}, {"time": 851, "text": "You're always looking past each other, I guess."}, {"time": 855, "text": "You're not sending that signal."}, {"time": 856, "text": "Well, you're trying to."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Right, you're trying to."}, {"time": 858, "text": "A lot of times, or at least I find myself, I'm trying to look into the other person's eyes."}, {"time": 861, "text": "But they don't feel like you're looking to their eyes."}, {"time": 863, "text": "So then the question is, all right, am I supposed to look at the camera so that way you can have a sensation that I'm looking at you?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "I think that that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 870, "text": "And then with VR today, even without eye tracking and knowing what your eyes are actually looking at, you can fake it reasonably well, right?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "So you can look at where the head pose is."}, {"time": 882, "text": "And if it looks like I'm kind of looking in your general direction, then you can sort of assume that maybe there's some eye contact intended and you can do it in a way where it's like, okay, maybe it's not a fixated stare, but it's somewhat natural."}, {"time": 896, "text": "But once you have actual eye tracking, you can do it for real."}, {"time": 900, "text": "And I think that that's really important stuff."}, {"time": 902, "text": "So when I think about Meta's contribution to this field, I have to say it's not clear to me that any of the other companies that are focused on the Metaverse or on virtual and augmented reality are gonna prioritize putting these features in the hardware because like everything, they're trade offs, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "I mean, it adds some weight to the device."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Maybe it adds some thickness."}, {"time": 922, "text": "You could totally see another company taking the approach of let's just make the lightest and thinnest thing possible."}, {"time": 927, "text": "But I want us to design the most human thing possible that creates the richest sense of presence and cause so much of human emotion and expression comes from these like micro movements."}, {"time": 939, "text": "If I like move my eyebrow millimeter, you will notice and that like means something."}, {"time": 944, "text": "So the fact that we're losing these signals and a lot of communication I think is a loss."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So it's not like, okay, there's one feature and you add this, then it all of a sudden is gonna feel like we have real presence."}, {"time": 955, "text": "You can sort of look at how the human brain works and how we express and kind of read emotions and you can just build a roadmap of that, of just what are the most important things to try to unlock over a five to 10 year period and just try to make the experience more and more human and social."}, {"time": 972, "text": "When do you think would be a moment, like a singularity moment for the Metaverse where there's a lot of ways to ask this question, but people will have many or most of their meaningful experiences in the Metaverse versus the real world."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And actually it's interesting to think about the fact that a lot of people are having the most important moments of their life happen in the digital sphere, especially not during COVID, like even falling in love or meeting friends or getting excited about stuff that is happening on the 2D digital plane."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "When do you think the Metaverse will provide those experiences for a large number, like a majority of the population?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Yeah, I think it's a really good question."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "There was someone, I read this piece that framed this as a lot of people think that the Metaverse is about a place, but one definition of this is it's about a time when basically immersive digital worlds become the primary way that we live our lives and spend our time."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "I think that that's a reasonable construct."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "And from that perspective, I think you also just wanna look at this as a continuation because it's not like, okay, we are building digital worlds, but we don't have that today."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I think you and I probably already live a very large part of our life in digital worlds."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "They're just not 3D immersive virtual reality, but I do a lot of meetings over video or I spend a lot of time writing things over email or WhatsApp or whatever."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "So what is it gonna take to get there for kind of the immersive presence version of this, which I think is what you're asking."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And for that, I think that there's just a bunch of different use cases."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And I think when you're building technology, I think a lot of it is just you're managing this duality where on the one hand, you wanna build these elegant things that can scale and have billions of people use them and get value from them."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And then on the other hand, you're fighting this kind of ground game where there are just a lot of different use cases and people do different things and you wanna be able to unlock them."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So the first ones that we basically went after were gaming with Quest and social experiences."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And it goes back to when we started working on virtual reality."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "My theory at the time was basically people thought about it as gaming, but if you look at all computing platforms up to that point, gaming is a huge part, it was a huge part of PCs, it was a huge part of mobile, but it was also very decentralized."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "There wasn't, for the most part, one or two gaming companies."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "There were a lot of gaming companies and gaming is somewhat hits based."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "I mean, we're getting some games that have more longevity, but in general, there were a lot of different games out there."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "But on PC and on mobile, the companies that focused on communication and social interaction, there tended to be a smaller number of those and that ended up being just as important of a thing as all of the games that you did combined."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "I think productivity is another area."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "That's obviously something that we've historically been less focused on, but I think it's gonna be really important for us."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "With workroom, do you mean productivity in the collaborative aspect?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Yeah, I think that there's a workroom's aspect of this, like a meeting aspect, and then I think that there's like a Word, Excel, productivity, either you're working or coding or knowledge work as opposed to just meetings."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "So you can kind of go through all these different use cases."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Gaming, I think we're well on our way."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Social, I think we're just the kind of preeminent company that focuses on this."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "And I think that that's already on Quest becoming the, if you look at the list of what are the top apps, social apps are already number one, two, three."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So that's kind of becoming a critical thing, but I don't know."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "I would imagine for someone like you, it'll be until we get a lot of the work things dialed in."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "When this is just like much more adopted and clearly better than Zoom for VC, when if you're doing your coding or your writing or whatever it is in VR, which it's not that far off to imagine that because pretty soon you're just gonna be able to have a screen that's bigger than, it'll be your ideal setup and you can bring it with you and put it on anywhere and have your kind of ideal workstation."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So I think that there are a few things to work out on that, but I don't think that that's more than five years off."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then you'll get a bunch of other things that like aren't even possible or you don't even think about using a phone or PC for today, like fitness, right?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So, I mean, I know you're, we were talking before about how you're into running and like I'm really into a lot of things around fitness as well, different things in different places."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "I got really into hydrofoiling recently and surfing and I used to fence competitively."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I like run."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So, and you were saying that you were thinking about trying different martial arts and I tried to trick you and convince you into doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Or you actually mentioned that that was one you're curious about and I don't know."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Is that a trick?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "We're in the metaverse now."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Yeah, no, I took that seriously."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "I thought that that was a real suggestion."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "That would be an amazing chance if we ever step on the mat together and just like roll around."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "I'll show you some moves."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Well, give me a year to train and then we can do it."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "You know,

all, can I just comment on the fact every time I played around with Quest 2, I just, I get giddy every time I step into virtual reality."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So you mentioned productivity and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "That's definitely something I'm excited about, but really I just love the possibilities of stepping into that world."}, {"time": 1348, "text":

just love, get excited for stepping in those virtual worlds."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "So I'm a huge fan."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "In terms of the productivity as a programmer, I spend most of my day programming."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "That's really interesting also, but then you have to develop the right IDEs."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "You have to develop, like there has to be a threshold where a large amount of the programming community moves there, but the collaborative aspects that are possible in terms of meetings, in terms of when two coders are working together, I mean, the possibilities there are super, super exciting."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I think that in building this, we sort of need to balance."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "There are gonna be some new things that you just couldn't do before."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And those are gonna be the amazing experiences."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "So teleporting to any place, right?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Whether it's a real place or something that people made."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And I mean, some of the experiences around how we can build stuff in new ways, where a lot of the stuff that, when I'm coding stuff, it's like, all right, you code it and then you build it and then you see it afterwards."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But increasingly it's gonna be possible to, you're in a world and you're building the world as you are in it and kind of manipulating it."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "One of the things that we showed at our Inside the Lab for recent artificial intelligence progress is this Builder Bot program, where now you can just talk to it and say, hey, okay, I'm in this world, like put some trees over there and it'll do that."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And like, all right, put some bottles of water on our picnic blanket and it'll do that and you're in the world."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "And I think there are gonna be new paradigms for coding."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So yeah, there are gonna be some things that I think are just pretty amazing, especially the first few times that you do them, but that you're like, whoa, like I've never had an experience like this."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "But most of your life, I would imagine, is not doing things that are amazing for the first time."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "A lot of this in terms of, I mean, just answering your question from before around, what is it gonna take before you're spending most of your time in this?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Well, first of all, let me just say it as an aside, the goal isn't to have people spend a lot more time in computing."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "It's to make it so that."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I'm asking for myself."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Yeah, it's to make it."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "When will I spend all my time in?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Yeah, it's to make computing more natural."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "But I think you will spend most of your computing time in this when it does the things that you use computing for somewhat better."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "So maybe having your perfect workstation is a 5% improvement on your coding productivity."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Maybe it's not like a completely new thing."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "But I mean, look, if I could increase the productivity of every engineer at Meta by 5%, we'd buy those devices for everyone."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And I imagine a lot of other companies would too."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And that's how you start getting to the scale that I think makes this rival some of the bigger computing platforms that exist today."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Let me ask you about identity."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "We talked about the avatar."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "How do you see identity in the Metaverse?"}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Should the avatar be tied to your identity or can I be anything in the Metaverse?"}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Like, can I be whatever the heck I want?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Can I even be a troll?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So there's exciting freeing possibilities and there's the darker possibilities too."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think that there's gonna be a range, right?"}, {"time": 1563, "text": "So we're working on, for expression and avatars, on one end of the spectrum are kind of expressive and cartoonish avatars."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And then on the other end of the spectrum are photorealistic avatars."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And I just think the reality is that there are gonna be different use cases for different things."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And I guess there's another axis."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So if you're going from photorealistic to expressive, there's also like representing you directly versus like some fantasy identity."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And I think that there are gonna be things on all ends of that spectrum too, right?"}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So you'll want photo, like in some experience, you might wanna be like a photorealistic dragon, right?"}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Or if I'm playing Onward, or just this military simulator game, I think getting to be more photorealistic as a soldier in that could enhance the experience."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "There are times when I'm hanging out with friends where I want them to know it's me."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So a kind of cartoonish or expressive version of me is good."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But there are also experiences like, VRChat does this well today, where a lot of the experience is kind of dressing up and wearing a fantastical avatar that's almost like a meme or is humorous."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So you come into an experience and it's almost like you have like a built in icebreaker because like you see people and you're just like, all right, I'm cracking up at what you're wearing because that's funny."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "And it's just like, where'd you get that?"}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Or, oh, you made that?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "That's, it's awesome."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "Whereas, okay, if you're going into a work meeting, maybe a photorealistic version of your real self is gonna be the most appropriate thing for that."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So I think the reality is there aren't going to be, it's not just gonna be one thing."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "You know, my own sense of kind of how you wanna express identity online has sort of evolved over time."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And that, you know, early days in Facebook, I thought, okay, people are gonna have one identity."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And now I think that's clearly not gonna be the case."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I think you're gonna have all these different things and there's utility in being able to do different things."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So some of the technical challenges that I'm really interested in around it are how do you build the software to allow people to seamlessly go between them?"}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So say, so you could view them as just completely discrete points on a spectrum, but let's talk about the metaverse economy for a second."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Let's say I buy a digital shirt for my photorealistic avatar, which by the way, I think at the time where we're spending a lot of time in the metaverse doing a lot of our work meetings in the metaverse and et cetera, I would imagine that the economy around virtual clothing as an example is going to be quite as big."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Why wouldn't I spend almost as much money in investing in my appearance or expression for my photorealistic avatar for meetings as I would for whatever I'm gonna wear in my video chat."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "But the question is, okay, so you, let's say you buy some shirt for your photorealistic avatar."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to basically translate that into a more expressive thing for your kind of cartoonish or expressive avatar?"}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And there are multiple ways to do that."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "You can view them as two discrete points and okay, maybe if a designer sells one thing, then it actually comes in a pack and there's two and you can use either one on that, but I actually think this stuff might exist more as a spectrum in the future."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "And that's what I do think the direction on some of the AI advances that is happening to be able to, especially stuff around like style transfer, being able to take a piece of art or express something and say, okay, paint me this photo in the style of Gauguin or whoever it is that you're interested in."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Take this shirt and put it in the style of what I've designed for my expressive avatar."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "I think that's gonna be pretty compelling."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "And so the fashion, you might be buying like a generator, like a closet that generates a style."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And then like with the GANs, you'll be able to infinitely generate outfits thereby making it, so the reason I wear the same thing all the time is I don't like choice."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "You've talked about the same thing, but now you don't even have to choose."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Your closet generates your outfit for you every time."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So you have to live with the outfit it generates."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I mean, you could do that, although, no, I think that that's, I think some people will, but I think like, I think there's going to be a huge aspect of just people doing creative commerce here."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "So I think that there is going to be a big market around people designing digital clothing."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "But the question is, if you're designing digital clothing, do you need to design, if you're the designer, do you need to make it for each kind of specific discrete point along a spectrum, or are you just designing it for kind of a photo realistic case or an expressive case, or can you design one and have it translate across these things?"}, {"time": 1857, "text": "If I buy a style from a designer who I care about, and now I'm a dragon, is there a way to morph that so it goes on the dragon in a way that makes sense?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "And that I think is an interesting AI problem because you're probably not going to make it so that designers have to go design for all those things."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "But the more useful the digital content is that you buy in a lot of uses, in a lot of use cases, the more that economy will just explode."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And that's a lot of what all of the, we were joking about NFTs before, but I think a lot of the promise here is that if the digital goods that you buy are not just tied to one platform or one use case, they end up being more valuable, which means that people are more willing and more likely to invest in them, and that just spurs the whole economy."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "But the question is, that's a fascinating positive aspect, but the potential negative aspect is that you can have people concealing their identity in order to troll or even not people, bots."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So how do you know in the metaverse that you're talking to a real human or an AI or a well intentioned human?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Is that something you think about, something you're concerned about?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Well, let's break that down into a few different cases."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "I mean, because knowing that you're talking to someone who has good intentions is something that I think is not even solved in pretty much anywhere."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "But I mean, if you're talking to someone who's a dragon, I think it's pretty clear that they're not representing themselves as a person."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I think probably the most pernicious thing that you want to solve for is, I think probably one of the scariest ones is how do you make sure that someone isn't impersonating you?"}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So, okay, you're in a future version of this conversation, and we have photorealistic avatars, and we're doing this in work rooms or whatever the future version of that is, and someone walks in who looks like me."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "How do you know that that's me?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "And one of the things that we're thinking about is it's still a pretty big AI project to be able to generate photorealistic avatars that basically can like, they work like these codecs of you, right?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So you kind of have a map from your headset and whatever sensors of what your body's actually doing, and it takes the model and it kind of displays it in VR."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "But there's a question, which is, should there be some sort of biometric security so that when I put on my VR headset or I'm going to go use that avatar, I need to first prove that I am that?"}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And I think you probably are gonna want something like that."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So as we're developing these technologies, we're also thinking about the security for things like that because people aren't gonna wanna be impersonated."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "That's a huge security issue."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Then you just get the question of people hiding behind fake accounts to do malicious things, which is not gonna be unique to the metaverse, although certainly in a environment where it's more immersive and you have more of a sense of presence, it could be more painful."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "But this is obviously something that we've just dealt with for years in social media and the internet more broadly."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "And there, I think there have been a bunch of tactics that I think we've just evolved to, we've built up these different AI systems to basically get a sense of, is this account behaving in the way that a person would?"}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And it turns out, so in all of the work that we've done around, we call it community integrity and it's basically like policing harmful content and trying to figure out where to draw the line."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And there are all these like really hard and philosophical questions around like, where do you draw the line on some of this stuff?"}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And the thing that I've kind of found the most effective is as much as possible trying to figure out who are the inauthentic accounts or where are the accounts that are behaving in an overall harmful way at the account level, rather than trying to get into like policing what they're saying, right?"}, {"time": 2101, "text": "Which I think the metaverse is gonna be even harder because the metaverse I think will have more properties of, it's almost more like a phone call, right?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Or it's not like I post a piece of content and is that piece of content good or bad?"}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So I think more of this stuff will have to be done at the level of the account."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "But this is the area where, between the kind of counter intelligence teams that we built up inside the company and like years of building just different AI systems to basically detect what is a real account and what isn't."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "I'm not saying we're perfect, but like this is an area where I just think we are like years ahead of basically anyone else in the industry in terms of having built those capabilities."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "And I think that that just is gonna be incredibly important for this next wave of things."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And like you said, on a technical level, on a philosophical level, it's an incredibly difficult problem to solve."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "By the way, I would probably like to open source my avatar so there could be like millions of Lexis walking around just like an army."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Like Agent Smith?"}, {"time": 2168, "text": "Agent Smith, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So the Unity ML folks built a copy of me and they sent it to me."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "So there's a person running around and I've just been doing reinforcement learning on it."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "I was gonna release it because just to have sort of like thousands of Lexis doing reinforcement."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "So they fall over naturally, they have to learn how to like walk around and stuff."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "So I love that idea, this tension between biometric security, you want to have one identity, but then certain avatars, you might have to have many."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "I don't know which is better security, sort of flooding the world with Lexis and thereby achieving security or really being protective of your identity."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "I have to ask you a security question actually."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "Well, how does flooding the world with Lexis help me know in our conversation that I'm talking to the real Lex?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "I completely destroy the trust in all my relationships then, right?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "If I flood, cause then it's, yeah, that."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "I think that one's not gonna work that well for you."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "It's not gonna work that well for the original copy."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "It probably fits some things."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Like if you're a public figure and you're trying to have a bunch of, if you're trying to show up in a bunch of different places in the future, you'll be able to do that in the metaverse."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So that kind of replication I think will be useful."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But I do think that you're gonna want a notion of like, I am talking to the real one."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Yeah, especially if the fake ones start outperforming you and all your private relationships and then you're left behind."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "I mean, that's a serious concern I have with clones."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "Again, the things I think about."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "Okay, so I recently got, I use QNAP NAS storage."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "So just storage for video and stuff."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And I recently got hacked."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "This is the first time for me with ransomware."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "It's not me personally, it's all QNAP devices."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "So the question that people have is about security in general."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Because I was doing a lot of the right things in terms of security and nevertheless, ransomware basically disabled my device."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "What are the different steps you could take to protect people's data on the security front?"}, {"time": 2296, "text": "I think that there's different solutions for, and strategies where it makes sense to have stuff kind of put behind a fortress, right?"}, {"time": 2305, "text": "So the centralized model versus the decentralizing."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "Then I think both have strengths and weaknesses."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So I think anyone who says, okay, just decentralize everything, that'll make it more secure."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "I think that that's tough because, I mean, the advantage of something like encryption is that we run the largest encrypted service in the world with WhatsApp."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And we're one of the first to roll out a multi platform encryption service."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And that's something that I think was a big advance for the industry."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And one of the promises that we can basically make because of that, our company doesn't see when you're sending an encrypted message and to an encrypted message, what the content is of what you're sharing."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "So that way, if someone hacks Meta servers, they're not gonna be able to access the WhatsApp message that you're sending to your friend."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "And that I think matters a lot to people because obviously if someone is able to compromise a company's servers and that company has hundreds of millions or billions of people, then that ends up being a very big deal."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "The flip side of that is, okay, all the content is on your phone."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "Are you following security best practices on your phone?"}, {"time": 2375, "text": "If you lose your phone, all your content is gone."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "Maybe you go back up your content from WhatsApp or some other service in an iCloud or something, but then you're just at Apple's whims about, are they gonna go turn over the data to some government or are they gonna get hacked?"}, {"time": 2393, "text": "So a lot of the time it is useful to have data in a centralized place too because then you can train systems that can just do much better personalization."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I think that in a lot of cases, centralized systems can offer, especially if you're a serious company, you're running the state of the art stuff and you have red teams attacking your own stuff and you're putting out bounty programs and trying to attract some of the best hackers in the world to go break into your stuff all the time."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "So I think you want to adopt that approach as a company and just constantly be hardening yourself."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Trying to stay one step ahead of the attackers."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "It's an inherently adversarial space."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "I think it's an interesting security is interesting because of the different kind of threats that we've managed over the last five years, there are ones where basically the adversaries keep on getting better and better."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So trying to kind of interfere with security is certainly one area of this."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "If you have nation states that are trying to interfere in elections or something, they're kind of evolving their tactics."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Whereas on the other hand, I don't want to be too simplistic about it, but if someone is saying something hateful, people usually aren't getting smarter and smarter about how they say hateful things."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "So maybe there's some element of that, but it's a very small dynamic compared to how advanced attackers and some of these other places get over time."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "I believe most people are good, so they actually get better over time and not being less hateful because they realize it's not fun being hateful."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "That's at least the belief I have."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "But first, bathroom break."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Sure, okay."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "So we'll come back to AI, but let me ask some difficult questions now."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Social Dilemma is a popular documentary that raised concerns about the effects of social media on society."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "You responded with a point by point rebuttal titled, What the Social Dilemma Gets Wrong."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "People should read that."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "I would say the key point they make is because social media is funded by ads, algorithms want to maximize attention and engagement and an effective way to do so is to get people angry at each other, increase division and so on."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "Can you steel man their criticisms and arguments that they make in the documentary as a way to understand the concern and as a way to respond to it?"}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Well, yeah, I think that's a good conversation to have."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I don't happen to agree with the conclusions and I think that they make a few assumptions that are just very big jumps that I don't think are reasonable to make."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "But I understand overall why people would be concerned that our business model and ads in general, we do make more money as people use the service more in general, right?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "So as a kind of basic assumption, okay, do we have an incentive for people to build a service that people use more?"}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Yes, on a lot of levels."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "I mean, we think what we're doing is good."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So we think that if people are finding it useful, they'll use it more."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "Or if you just look at it as this sort of, if the only thing we cared about is money, which is not for anyone who knows me, but okay, we're a company."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "So let's say you just kind of simplified it down to that, then would we want people to use the services more?"}, {"time": 2633, "text": "Yes, and then you get to the second question, which is does kind of getting people agitated make them more likely to use the services more?"}, {"time": 2647, "text": "And I think from looking at other media in the world, especially TV, and there's the old news adage, if it bleeds, it leads."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Like I think that this is, there are a bunch of reasons why someone might think that that kind of provocative content would be the most engaging."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "Now, what I've always found is two things."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "One is that what grabs someone's attention in the near term is not necessarily something that they're going to appreciate having seen or going to be the best over the long term."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "So I think what a lot of people get wrong is that I'm not building this company to make the most money or get people to spend the most time on this in the next quarter or the next year."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "I've been doing this for 17 years at this point, and I'm still relatively young, and I have a lot more that I wanna do over the coming decades."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "So I think that it's too simplistic to say, hey, this might increase time in the near term, therefore, it's what you're gonna do."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "Because I actually think a deeper look at kind of what my incentives are, the incentives of a company that are focused on the long term, is to basically do what people are gonna find valuable over time, not what is gonna draw people's attention today."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "The other thing that I'd say is that, I think a lot of times people look at this from the perspective of media or kind of information or civic discourse, but one other way of looking at this is just that, okay, I'm a product designer, right?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Our company, we build products, and a big part of building a product is not just the function and utility of what you're delivering, but the feeling of how it feels, right?"}, {"time": 2752, "text": "And we spend a lot of time talking about virtual reality and how the kind of key aspect of that experience is the feeling of presence, which it's a visceral thing."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "It's not just about the utility that you're delivering, it's about like the sensation."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And similarly, I care a lot about how people feel when they use our products, and I don't want to build products that make people angry."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I mean, that's like not, I think, what we're here on this earth to do, is to build something that people spend a bunch of time doing and it just kind of makes them angrier at other people."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "I mean, I think that that's not good."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "That's not what I think would be sort of a good use of our time or a good contribution to the world."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So, okay, it's like people, they tell us on a per content basis, does this thing, do I like it?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "Do I love it?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "Does it make me angry?"}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Does it make me sad?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And based on that, we choose to basically show content that makes people angry less, because of course, if you're designing a product and you want people to be able to connect and feel good over a long period of time, then that's naturally what you're gonna do."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "So, I don't know, I think overall, I understand at a high level, if you're not thinking too deeply about it, why that argument might be appealing."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "But I just think if you actually look at what our real incentives are, not just like if we were trying to optimize for the next week, but like as people working on this, like why are we here?"}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And I think it's pretty clear that that's not actually how you would wanna design the system."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "I guess one other thing that I'd say is that, while we're focused on the ads business model, I do think it's important to note that a lot of these issues are not unique to ads."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "I mean, so take like a subscription news business model, for example, I think that has just as many potential pitfalls."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Maybe if someone's paying for a subscription, you don't get paid per piece of content that they look at, but say for example, I think like a bunch of the partisanship that we see could potentially be made worse by you have these kind of partisan news organizations that basically sell subscriptions and they're only gonna get people on one side to basically subscribe to them."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "So their incentive is not to print content or produce content that's kind of centrist or down the line either."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "I bet that what a lot of them find is that if they produce stuff that's kind of more polarizing or more partisan, then that is what gets the more subscribers."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So I think that this stuff is all, there's no perfect business model."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Everything has pitfalls."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "The thing that I think is great about advertising is it makes it so the consumer service is free, which if you believe that everyone should have a voice and everyone should be able to connect, then that's a great thing, as opposed to building a luxury service that not everyone can afford."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "But look, every business model, you have to be careful about how you're implementing what you're doing."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "You responded to a few things there."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "You spoke to the fact that there is a narrative of malevolence, like you're leaning into them, making people angry just because it makes more money in the short term, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So you responded to that."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "But there's also kind of reality of human nature."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "Just like you spoke about, there's fights, arguments we get in and we don't like ourselves afterwards, but we got into them anyway."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So our longterm growth is, I believe for most of us, has to do with learning, challenging yourself, improving, being kind to each other, finding a community of people that you connect with on a real human level, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "But it does seem when you look at social media that a lot of fights break out, a lot of arguments break out, a lot of viral content ends up being sort of outrage in one direction or the other."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "And so it's easy from that to infer the narrative that social media companies are letting this outrage become viral."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And so they're increasing the division in the world."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "I mean, perhaps you can comment on that or further, how can you be, how can you push back on this narrative?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "How can you be transparent about this battle?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Because I think it's not just motivation or financials, it's a technical problem too, which is how do you improve longterm wellbeing of human beings?"}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I think that going through some of the design decisions would be a good conversation."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "But first, I actually think, I think you acknowledged that, that narrative is somewhat anecdotal."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And I think it's worth grounding this conversation in the actual research that has been done on this, which by and large finds that social media is not a large driver of polarization, right?"}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And, I mean, there's been a number of economists and social scientists and folks who have studied this."}, {"time": 3078, "text": "In a lot of polarization, it varies around the world."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "If social media is basically in every country, Facebook's in pretty much every country except for China and maybe North Korea."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And you see different trends in different places where in a lot of countries polarization is declining, in some it's flat, in the US it's risen sharply."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "So the question is, what are the unique phenomenon in the different places?"}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And I think for the people who are trying to say, hey, social media is the thing that's doing this."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I think that that clearly doesn't hold up because social media is a phenomenon that is pretty much equivalent in all of these different countries."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And you have researchers like this economist at Stanford, Matthew Genskow, who has just written at length about this."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "And it's a bunch of books by political scientists, Ezra Klein and folks, why we're polarized, basically goes through this decades long analysis in the US."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "Before I was born, basically talking about some of the forces in kind of partisan politics and Fox News and different things that predate the internet in a lot of ways that I think are likely larger contributors."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "So to the contrary on this, not only is it pretty clear that social media is not a major contributor, but most of the academic studies that I've seen actually show that social media use is correlated with lower polarization."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And Genskow, the same person who just did the study that I cited about longitudinal polarization across different countries, also did a study that basically showed that if you looked after the 2016 election in the US, the voters who were the most polarized were actually the ones who were not on the internet."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "So, and there have been recent other studies, I think in Europe and around the world, basically showing that as people stop using social media, they tend to get more polarized."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Then there's a deeper analysis around, okay, well, polarization actually isn't even one thing."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Cause you know, having different opinions on something isn't, I don't think that that's by itself bad."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "What people who study this say is most problematic is what they call affective polarization, which is basically are you, do you have negative feelings towards people of another group?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "And the way that a lot of scholars study this is they basically ask a group, would you let your kids marry someone of group X?"}, {"time": 3230, "text": "Whatever the groups are that you're worried that someone might have negative feelings towards."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And in general, use of social media has corresponded to decreases in that kind of affective polarization."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "So I just wanna, I think we should talk through the design decisions and how we handle the kind of specific pieces of content, but overall, I think it's just worth grounding that discussion in the research that's existed that I think overwhelmingly shows that the mainstream narrative around this is just not right."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But the narrative does take hold and it's compelling to a lot of people."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "There's another question I'd like to ask you on this."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "I was looking at various polls and saw that you're one of the most disliked tech leaders today, 54% unfavorable rating."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "Elon Musk is 23%."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "It's basically everybody has a very high unfavorable rating that are tech leaders."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "Maybe you can help me understand that."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "Why do you think so many people dislike you?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Some even hate you."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "And how do you regain their trust and support?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "Given everything you just said, why are you losing the battle in explaining to people what actual impact social media has on society?"}, {"time": 3312, "text": "Well, I'm curious if that's a US survey or world."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "It is US, yeah."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "So I think that there's a few dynamics."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "One is that our brand has been somewhat uniquely challenged in the US compared to other places."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "It's not that there are."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "I mean, other countries, we have issues too, but I think in the US, there was this dynamic where if you look at like the next sentiment of kind of coverage or attitude towards us, before 2016, I think that there were probably very few months, if any, where it was negative."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And since 2016, I think that there probably been very few months, if any, then it's been positive."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "But I think it's a specific thing."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And this is very different from other places."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So I think in a lot of other countries in the world, the sentiment towards meta and our services is extremely positive."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "In the US, we have more challenges."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "And I think compared to other companies, you can look at certain industries, I think if you look at it from like a partisan perspective, not from like a political perspective, but just kind of culturally, it's like there are people who are probably more left of center and there are people who are more right of center, and there's kind of blue America and red America."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "There are certain industries that I think maybe one half of the country has a more positive view towards than another."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "The net effect of that is that we're kind of constantly making decisions that piss off people in both camps."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "They're just like, ah, you didn't mess that one up."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "But their opinion doesn't tend to go up by that much."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "Whereas the people who kind of are on the other side of it are like, God, how could you mess that up?"}, {"time": 3475, "text": "How could you possibly think that that piece of content is okay and should be up and should not be censored?"}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Or, and so I think the, whereas if you leave it up and, you know, it's, or if you take it down, the people who thought it should be taken down or, you know, it's like, all right, fine, great."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "You didn't mess that one up."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So our internal assessment of, and the kind of analytics on our brand are basically anytime one of these big controversial things comes up in society, our brand goes down with half of the country."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "And then like, if you, and then if you just kind of extrapolate that out, it's just been very challenging for us to try to navigate what is a polarizing country in a principled way, where we're not trying to kind of hew to one side or the other, we're trying to do what we think is the right thing."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "But that's what I think is the right thing for us to do though."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "So, I mean, that's what we'll try to keep doing."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Just as a human being, how does it feel though, when you're giving so much of your day to day life to try to heal division, to try to do good in the world, as we've talked about, that so many people in the US, the place you call home have a negative view of you as a leader, as a human being and the company you love?"}, {"time": 3554, "text": "Well, I mean, it's not great, but I mean, look, if I wanted people to think positively about me as a person, I don't know, I'm not sure if you go build a company."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "I mean, it's like."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Or a social media company."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "It seems exceptionally difficult to do with a social media company."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, I don't know, there is a dynamic where a lot of the other people running these companies, internet companies, have sort of stepped back and they just do things that are sort of, I don't know, less controversial."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "And some of it may be that they just get tired over time."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "But, you know, it's, so I don't know."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "I think that, you know, running a company is hard, building something at scale is hard."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "You only really do it for a long period of time if you really care about what you're doing."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And yeah, so, I mean, it's not great, but like, but look, I think that at some level, whether 25% of people dislike you or 75% of people dislike you, your experience as a public figure is gonna be that there's a lot of people who dislike you, right?"}, {"time": 3623, "text": "So, I actually am not sure how different it is."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "You know, certainly, you know, the country's gotten more polarized and we in particular have gotten, you know, more controversial over the last five or years or so."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "But, I don't know, I kind of think like as a public figure and leader of one of these enterprises."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Comes with the job."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "Yeah, part of what you do is like, and look, the answer can't just be ignore it, right?"}, {"time": 3654, "text": "Because like a huge part of the job is like you need to be getting feedback and internalizing feedback on how you can do better."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "But I think increasingly what you need to do is be able to figure out, you know, who are the kind of good faith critics who are criticizing you because they're trying to help you do a better job rather than tear you down."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "So I think that that's just kind of a dance that people have to do."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "But I mean, I, you know, so you kind of develop more of a feel for like, who actually is trying to accomplish the same types of things in the world and who has different ideas about how to do that and how can I learn from those people?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "And like, yeah, we get stuff wrong."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "And when the people whose opinions I respect call me out on getting stuff wrong, that hurts and makes me wanna do better."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "But I think at this point, I'm pretty tuned to just, all right, if someone, if I know they're, they're kind of like operating in bad faith and they're not really trying to help, then, you know, I don't know, it's not, it's, it doesn't, you know, I think over time, it just doesn't bother you that much."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "But you are surrounded by people that believe in the mission that love you."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "Are there friends or colleagues in your inner circle you trust that call you out on your bullshit whenever your thinking may be misguided as it is for leaders at times?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "I think we have a famously open company culture where we sort of encourage that kind of dissent internally, which is, you know, why there's so much material internally that can leak out with people sort of disagreeing is because that's sort of the culture."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "You know, our management team, I think it's a lot of people, you know, there are some newer folks who come in, there are some folks who've kind of been there for a while, but there's a very high level of trust."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And I would say it is a relatively confrontational group of people."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "And my friends and family, I think, will push me on this."}, {"time": 3784, "text": "But look, it's not just, but I think you need some diversity, right?"}, {"time": 3789, "text": "It can't just be, you know, people who are your friends and family."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "But, you know, I think fundamentally we're trying to get to the same place in terms of, you know, helping people connect more, helping the whole world function better, not just, you know, one place or another."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And I don't know, I mean, those are the people whose opinions really matter to me."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And I just, it's, you know, that's how I learn on a day to day basis."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "People are constantly sending me comments on stuff or links to things they found interesting."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "And I don't know, it's kind of constantly evolving this model of the world and kind of what we should be aspiring to be."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "You've talked about, you have a famously open culture which comes with the criticism and the painful experiences."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "So let me ask you another difficult question."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower, leaked the internal Instagram research into teenagers and wellbeing."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "Her claim is that Instagram is choosing profit over wellbeing of teenage girls."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So Instagram is quote, toxic for them."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "Your response titled, what our research really says about teen wellbeing and Instagram says, no, Instagram research shows that 11 of 12 wellbeing issues, teenage girls who said they struggle with those difficult issues also said that Instagram made them better rather than worse."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "Again, can you steal man and defend the point and Frances Haugen's characterization of the study and then help me understand the positive and negative effects of Instagram and Facebook on young people?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "So there are certainly questions around teen mental health that are really important."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "It's hard to, as a parent, it's like hard to imagine any set of questions that are sort of more important."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "I mean, I guess maybe other aspects of physical health or wellbeing are probably come to that level, but like, these are really important questions, right?"}, {"time": 3940, "text": "Which is why we dedicate teams to studying them."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "I don't think the internet or social media are unique in having these questions."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "I mean, I think people and there've been sort of magazines with promoting certain body types for women and kids for decades, but we really care about this stuff."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "So we wanted to study it."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "And of course, we didn't expect that everything was gonna be positive all the time."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So, I mean, the reason why you study this stuff is to try to improve and get better."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So, I mean, look, the place where I disagree with the characterization first, I thought some of the reporting and coverage of it just took the whole thing out of proportion and that it focused on, as you said, I think there were like 20 metrics in there and on 18 or 19, the effect of using Instagram was neutral or positive on the teen's wellbeing."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "And there was one area where I think it showed that we needed to improve and we took some steps to try to do that after doing the research."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "But I think having the coverage just focus on that one without focusing on the, I mean, I think an accurate characterization would have been that kids using Instagram or not kids, teens is generally positive for their mental health."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "But of course, that was not the narrative that came out."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "So I think it's hard to, that's not a kind of logical thing to straw man, but I sort of disagree or steel man, but I sort of disagree with that overall characterization."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "I think anyone sort of looking at this objectively would, but then, I mean, there is this sort of intent critique that I think you were getting at before, which says, it assumes some sort of malevolence, right?"}, {"time": 4039, "text": "It's like, which it's really hard for me to really wrap my head around this because as far as I know, it's not clear that any of the other tech companies are doing this kind of research."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "So why the narrative should form that we did research because we were studying an issue because we wanted to understand it to improve and took steps after that to try to improve it, that your interpretation of that would be that we did the research and tried to sweep it under the rug."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "It just, it sort of is like, I don't know, it's beyond credibility to me that like that's the accurate description of the actions that we've taken compared to the others in the industry."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "So I don't know, that's kind of, that's my view on it."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "These are really important issues and there's a lot of stuff that I think we're gonna be working on related to teen mental health for a long time, including trying to understand this better."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "And I would encourage everyone else in the industry to do this too."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Yeah, I would love there to be open conversations and a lot of great research being released internally and then also externally."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "It doesn't make me feel good to see press obviously get way more clicks when they say negative things about social media."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "Objectively speaking, I can just tell that there's hunger to say negative things about social media."}, {"time": 4126,

research."}, {"time": 4139, "text": "I mean, I don't know what to do with that, but let me ask you as a father, there's a weight heavy on you that people get bullied on social networks."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "So people get bullied in their private life."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "But now because so much of our life is in the digital world, the bullying moves from the physical world to the digital world."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "So you're now creating a platform on which bullying happens."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And some of that bullying can lead to damage to mental health."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And some of that bullying can lead to depression, even suicide."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "There's a weight heavy on you that people have committed suicide or will commit suicide based on the bullying that happens on social media."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a set of harms that we basically track and build systems to fight against."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And bullying and self harm are, these are some of the biggest things that we are most focused on."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "For bullying, like you say, it's gonna be, while this predates the internet, then it's probably impossible to get rid of all of it."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "You wanna give people tools to fight it and you wanna fight it yourself."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And you also wanna make sure that people have the tools to get help when they need it."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So I think this isn't like a question of, can you get rid of all bullying?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "I mean, it's like, all right, I mean, I have two daughters and they fight and push each other around and stuff too."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "And the question is just, how do you handle that situation?"}, {"time": 4247, "text": "And there's a handful of things that I think you can do."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "We talked a little bit before around some of the AI tools that you can build to identify when something harmful is happening."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "It's actually, it's very hard in bullying because a lot of bullying is very context specific."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "It's not like you're trying to fit a formula of like, if like looking at the different harms, someone promoting a terrorist group is like, probably one of the simpler things to generally find because things promoting that group are gonna look at a certain way or feel a certain way."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "Bullying could just be, you know, someone making some subtle comment about someone's appearance that's idiosyncratic to them."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "And it could look at just like humor."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "So humor to one person can be destructive to another human being, yeah."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "So with bullying, I think there are certain things that you can find through AI systems, but I think it is increasingly important to just give people more agency themselves."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "So we've done things like making it so people can turn off comments or take a break from hearing from a specific person without having to signal at all that they're gonna stop following them or kind of make some stand that, okay, I'm not friends with you anymore."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "I'm not following you."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "I just like, I just don't wanna hear about this, but I also don't wanna signal at all publicly that or to them that there's been an issue."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And then you get to some of the more extreme cases like you're talking about where someone is thinking about self harm or suicide."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And there we've found that that is a place where AI can identify a lot as well as people flagging things."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "If people are expressing something that is potentially they're thinking of hurting themselves, those are cues that you can build systems and hundreds of languages around the world to be able to identify that."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "We're rolling that out in more places around the world."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "And I think the team that worked on that just did awesome stuff."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "So I think that that's a long way of saying, yeah, I mean, this is a heavy topic and you want to attack it in a bunch of different ways and also kind of understand that some of nature is for people to do this to each other, which is unfortunate, but you can give people tools and build things that help."},

allows people to hurt each other."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "And when you're managing such a platform, it's difficult."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "And I think you spoke to it, but the psychology of that, of being a leader in that space, of creating technology that's playing in this space, like you mentioned, psychology is really damn difficult."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "And I mean, the burden of that is just great."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "I just wanted to hear you speak to that point."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "I have to ask about the thing you've brought up a few times, which is making controversial decisions."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "Let's talk about free speech and censorship."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So there are two groups of people pressuring Meta on this."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "One group is upset that Facebook, the social network, allows misinformation in quotes to be spread on the platform."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "The other group are concerned that Facebook censors speech by calling it misinformation."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "So you're getting it from both sides."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "You, in 2019, October at Georgetown University, eloquently defended the importance of free speech, but then COVID came and the 2020 election came."}, {"time": 4504, "text": "Do you worry that outside pressures from advertisers, politicians, the public, have forced Meta to damage the ideal of free speech that you spoke highly of?"}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Just to say some obvious things upfront, I don't think pressure from advertisers or politicians directly in any way affects how we think about this."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "I think these are just hard topics."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "So let me just take you through our evolution from kind of the beginning of the company to where we are now."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "You don't build a company like this unless you believe that people expressing themselves is a good thing, right?"}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So that's sort of the foundational thing."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "You can kind of think about our company as a formula where we think giving people voice and helping people connect creates opportunity, right?"}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So those are the two things that we're always focused on are sort of helping people connect."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "We talked about that a lot, but also giving people voice and ability to express themselves."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "Then by the way, most of the time when people express themselves, that's not like politically controversial content."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "It's like expressing something about their identity that's more related to the avatar conversation we had earlier in terms of expressing some facet, but that's what's important to people on a day to day basis."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And sometimes when people feel strongly enough about something, it kind of becomes a political topic."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "That's sort of always been a thing that we've focused on."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "There's always been the question of safety in this, which if you're building a community, I think you have to focus on safety."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "We've had these community standards from early on, and there are about 20 different kinds of harm that we track and try to fight actively."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "We've talked about some of them already."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "So it includes things like bullying and harassment."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "It includes things like terrorism or promoting terrorism, inciting violence, intellectual property theft."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And in general, I think call it about 18 out of 20 of those."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "There's not really a particularly polarized definition of that."}, {"time": 4619, "text": "I think you're not really gonna find many people in the country or in the world who are trying to say we should be fighting terrorist content less."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "I think the content where there are a couple of areas where I think that this has gotten more controversial recently, which I'll talk about."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "And you're right, the misinformation is basically is up there."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And I think sometimes the definition of hate speech is up there too."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "But I think in general, most of the content that I think we're working on for safety is not actually, people don't kind of have these questions."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "So it's sort of this subset."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "But if you go back to the beginning of the company, this was sort of pre deep learning days."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "And therefore, it was me and my roommate Dustin join me."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "And if someone posted something bad, it was the AI technology did not exist yet to be able to go basically look at all the content."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "And we were a small enough outfit that no one would expect that we could review it all."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "Even if someone reported it to us, we basically did our best, right?"}, {"time": 4691, "text": "It's like someone would report it and we try to look at stuff and deal with stuff."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "And for call it the first seven or eight years of the company, we weren't that big of a company."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "For a lot of that period, we weren't even really profitable."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "The AI didn't really exist to be able to do the kind of moderation that we do today."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And then at some point in kind of the middle of the last decade, that started to flip."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "And we got to the point where we were sort of a larger and more profitable company."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "And the AI was starting to come online to be able to proactively detect some of the simpler forms of this."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "So things like pornography, you could train an image classifier to identify what a nipple was, or you can fight against terrorist content."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "You still could."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "There's actually papers on this, it's great."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "Oh, of course there are."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "Technical papers."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "Those are relatively easier things to train AI to do than for example, understand the nuances of what is inciting violence in a hundred languages around the world and not have the false positives of like, okay, are you posting about this thing that might be inciting violence because you're actually trying to denounce it?"}, {"time": 4766, "text": "In which case we probably shouldn't take that down."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "Where if you're trying to denounce something that's inciting violence in some kind of dialect in a corner of India, as opposed to, okay, actually you're posting this thing because you're trying to incite violence."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Okay, building an AI that can basically get to that level of nuance and all the languages that we serve is something that I think is only really becoming possible now, not towards the middle of the last decade."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "But there's been this evolution, and I think what happened, people sort of woke up after 2016 and a lot of people are like, okay, the country is a lot more polarized and there's a lot more stuff here than we realized."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "Why weren't these internet companies on top of this?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And I think at that point it was reasonable feedback that some of this technology had started becoming possible."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "And at that point, I really did feel like we needed to make a substantially larger investment."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "We'd already worked on this stuff a lot, on AI and on these integrity problems, but that we should basically invest, have a thousand or more engineers basically work on building these AI systems to be able to go and proactively identify the stuff across all these different areas."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "Okay, so we went and did that."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Now we've built the tools to be able to do that."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And now I think it's actually a much more complicated set of philosophical rather than technical questions, which is the exact policies, which are okay."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Now, the way that we basically hold ourselves accountable is we issue these transparency reports every quarter and the metric that we track is for each of these 20 types of harmful content."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "How much of that content are we taking down before someone even has to report it to us?"}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So how effective is our AI at doing this?"}, {"time": 4877, "text": "But that basically creates this big question, which is okay, now we need to really be careful about how proactive we set the AI and where the exact policy lines are around what we're taking down."}, {"time": 4890, "text": "It's certainly at a point now where I felt like at the beginning of that journey of building those AI systems, there was a lot of push."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "There's saying, okay, you've got to do more."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "There's clearly a lot more bad content that people aren't reporting or that you're not getting to and you need to get more effective at that."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "And I was pretty sympathetic to that."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "But then I think at some point along the way, there started to be almost equal issues on both sides of, okay, actually you're kind of taking down too much stuff, right?"}, {"time": 4922, "text": "Or some of the stuff is borderline and it wasn't really bothering anyone and they didn't report it."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "So is that really an issue that you need to take down?"}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Whereas we still have the critique on the other side too where a lot of people think we're not doing enough."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So it's become, as we built the technical capacity, I think it becomes more philosophically interesting almost where you wanna be on the line."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And I just think you don't want one person making those decisions."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "So we've also tried to innovate in terms of building out this independent oversight board, which has people who are dedicated to free expression but from around the world who people can appeal cases to."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So a lot of the most controversial cases basically go to them and they make the final binding decision on how we should handle that."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "And then of course, their decisions, we then try to figure out what the principles are behind those and encode them into the algorithms."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "And how are those people chosen, which, you know, you're outsourcing a difficult decision."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Yeah, the initial people, we chose a handful of chairs for the group and we basically chose the people for a commitment to free expression and like a broad understanding of human rights and the trade offs around free expression."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So they fundamentally people who are gonna lean towards free expression."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Towards freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "Okay, so there's also this idea of fact checkers."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "So jumping around to the misinformation questions, especially during COVID, which is an exceptionally speaking of polarization."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Can I speak to the COVID thing?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "I mean, I think one of the hardest set of questions around free expression, because you asked about Georgetown has my stance fundamentally changed?"}, {"time": 5023, "text": "And the answer to that is no, my stance has not changed."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "It is fundamentally the same as when I was talking at Georgetown from a philosophical perspective."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "The challenge with free speech is that everyone agrees that there is a line where if you're actually about to do physical harm to people that there should be restrictions."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "So, I mean, there's the famous Supreme Court historical example of like, you can't yell fire in a crowded theater."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "The thing that everyone disagrees on is what is the definition of real harm?"}, {"time": 5062, "text": "Where I think some people think, okay, this should only be a very literal, I mean, take it back to the bullying conversation we were just having, where is it just harm if the person is about to hurt themselves because they've been bullied so hard?"}, {"time": 5076, "text": "Or is it actually harm like as they're being bullied?"}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And kind of at what point in the spectrum is that?"}, {"time": 5082, "text": "And that's the part that there's not agreement on."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "But I think what people agree on pretty broadly is that when there is an acute threat that it does make sense from a societal perspective to tolerate less speech."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "That could be potentially harmful in that acute situation."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So I think where COVID got very difficult is, I don't think anyone expected this to be going on for years."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But if you'd kind of asked now a priori, would a global pandemic where a lot of people are dying and catching this, is that an emergency that where you'd kind of consider it that it's problematic to basically yell fire in a crowded theater?"}, {"time": 5126, "text": "I think that that probably passes that test."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So I think that it's a very tricky situation, but I think the fundamental commitment to free expression is there."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And that's what I believe."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "And again, I don't think you start this company unless you care about people being able to express themselves as much as possible."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "But I think that that's the question, is how do you define what the harm is and how acute that is?"}, {"time": 5152, "text": "And what are the institutions that define that harm?"}, {"time": 5155, "text": "A lot of the criticism is that the CDC, the WHO, the institutions we've come to trust as a civilization to give the line of what is and isn't harm in terms of health policy have failed in many ways, in small ways and in big ways, depending on who you ask."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And then the perspective of meta and Facebook is like, well, where the hell do I get the information of what is and isn't misinformation?"}, {"time": 5182, "text": "So it's a really difficult place to be in, but it's great to hear that you're leaning towards freedom of speech on this aspect."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And again, I think this actually calls to the fact that we need to reform institutions that help keep an open mind of what is and isn't misinformation."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "And misinformation has been used to bully on the internet."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "I mean, I just have, I'm friends with Joe Rogan and he is called as a, I remember hanging out with him in Vegas and somebody yelled, stop spreading misinformation."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "I mean, and there's a lot of people that follow him that believe he's not spreading misinformation."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "Like you can't just not acknowledge the fact that there's a large number of people that have a different definition of misinformation."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And that's such a tough place to be."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "Like who do you listen to?"}, {"time": 5231, "text": "Do you listen to quote unquote experts who gets, as a person who has a PhD, I gotta say, I mean, I'm not sure I know what defines an expert, especially in a new, in a totally new pandemic or a new catastrophic event, especially when politics is involved and especially when the news are, the media involved that can propagate sort of outrageous narratives and thereby make a lot of money."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "Like what the hell?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "Where's the source of truth?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And then everybody turns to Facebook."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "It's like, please tell me what the source of truth is."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "Well, I mean, well, how would you handle this if you were in my position?"}, {"time": 5272, "text": "Is very, very, very, very difficult."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "I would say, I would more speak about how difficult the choices are and be transparent about like, what the hell do you do with this?"}, {"time": 5285, "text": "Like here, you got exactly, ask the exact question you just asked me, but to the broader public, like, okay, yeah, you guys tell me what to do."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So like crowdsource it."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "And then the other aspect is when you spoke really eloquently about the fact that there's this going back and forth and now there's a feeling like you're censoring a little bit too much."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "So I would lean, I would try to be ahead of that feeling."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "I would now lean towards freedom of speech and say, we're not the ones that are going to define misinformation."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "Let it be a public debate, let the idea stand."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "And I actually place, this idea of misinformation, I place the responsibility on the poor communication skills of scientists."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "They should be in the battlefield of ideas and everybody who is spreading information against the vaccine, they should not be censored."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "They should be talked with and you should show the data, you should have open discussion as opposed to rolling your eyes and saying, I'm the expert, I know what I'm talking about."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "No, you need to convince people, it's a battle of ideas."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "So that's the whole point of freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "It's the way to defeat bad ideas is with good ideas, with speech."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "So like the responsibility here falls on the poor communication skills of scientists."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "Thanks to social media, scientists are not communicators."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "They have the power to communicate."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "Some of the best stuff I've seen about COVID from doctors is on social media."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "It's a way to learn to respond really quickly, to go faster than the peer review process."}, {"time": 5383, "text": "And so they just need to get way better at that communication."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "And also by better, I don't mean just convincing, I also mean speak with humility, don't talk down to people, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And as a platform, I would say, I would step back a little bit."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "Not all the way, of course, because there's a lot of stuff that can cause real harm as we've talked about, but you lean more towards freedom of speech because then people from a brand perspective wouldn't be blaming you for the other ills of society, which there are many."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "The institutions have flaws, the political divide, obviously politicians have flaws, that's news."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "The media has flaws that they're all trying to work with."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "And because of the central place of Facebook in the world, all of those flaws somehow kind of propagate to Facebook."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And you're sitting there as Plato, the philosopher, have to answer to some of the most difficult questions asking, being asked of human civilization."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "So I don't know, maybe this is an American answer though, to lean towards freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "I don't know if that applies globally."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "So yeah, I don't know."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "But transparency and saying, I think as a technologist, one of the things I sense about Facebook and meta when people talk about this company is they don't necessarily understand fully how difficult the problem is."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "You talked about AI has to catch a bunch of harmful stuff really quickly."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "Just the sea of data you have to deal with."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "It's a really difficult problem."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "So like any of the critics, if you just hand them the helm for a week, let's see how well you can do."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Like that, to me, that's definitely something that would wake people up to how difficult this problem is if there's more transparency of saying how difficult this problem is."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "Let me ask you about, on the AI front, just because you mentioned language and my ineloquence."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Translation is something I wanted to ask you about."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And first, just to give a shout out to the supercomputer."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "You've recently announced the AI research supercluster, RSC."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Obviously, I'm somebody who loves the GPUs."}, {"time": 5514, "text": "It currently has 6,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "NVIDIA DGX A100 is the systems that have in total 6,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "And it will eventually, maybe this year, maybe soon, will have 16,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "So it can do a bunch of different kinds of machine learning applications."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "There's a cool thing on the distributed storage aspect and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So one of the applications that I think is super exciting is translation, real time translation."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "I mentioned to you that having a conversation, I speak Russian fluently, I speak English somewhat fluently, and having a conversation with Vladimir Putin, say, as a use case."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "Me, as a user, coming to you as a use case."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "We both speak each other's language."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "I speak Russian, he speaks English."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "How can we have that communication go well with the help of AI?"}, {"time": 5569, "text": "I think it's such a beautiful and a powerful application of AI to connect the world, that bridge the gap, not necessarily between me and Putin, but people that don't have that shared language."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "Can you just speak about your vision with translation?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "Because I think that's a really exciting application."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "If you're trying to help people connect all around the world, a lot of content is produced in one language and people in all these other places are interested in it."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "So being able to translate that just unlocks a lot of value on a day to day basis."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "I mean, so the kind of AI around translation is interesting because it's gone through a bunch of iterations."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "But the basic state of the art is that you don't wanna go through different kind of intermediate symbolic representations of language or something like that."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "You basically wanna be able to map the concepts and basically go directly from one language to another."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "And you just can train bigger and bigger models in order to be able to do that."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "And that's where the research supercluster comes in is basically a lot of the trend in machine learning is just you're building bigger and bigger models and you just need a lot of computation to train them."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "So it's not that like the translation would run on the supercomputer, the training of the model, which could have billions or trillions of examples of just basically that."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "You're training models on this supercluster in days or weeks that might take a much longer period of time on a smaller cluster."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "So it just wouldn't be practical for most teams to do."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "But the translation work, we're basically getting from being able to go between about a hundred languages seamlessly today to being able to go to about 300 languages in the near term."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "So from any language to any other language."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "And part of the issue when you get closer to more languages is some of these get to be pretty, not very popular languages, right?"}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Where there isn't that much content in them."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "So you end up having less data and you need to kind of use a model that you've built up around other examples."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "And this is one of the big questions around AI is like how generalizable can things be?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "And that I think is one of the things that's just kind of exciting here from a technical perspective."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "But capturing, we talked about this with the metaverse, capturing the magic of human to human interaction."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "So me and Putin, okay."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "Again, this is therapy session."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "I mean, it's a tough example because you actually both speak Russian and English."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "No, but that's."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "But in the future."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "I see it as a touring test of a kind because we would both like to have an AI that improves because I don't speak Russian that well."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "He doesn't speak English that well."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "It would be nice to outperform our abilities and it sets a really nice bar because I think AI can really help in translation for people that don't speak the language at all, but to actually capture the magic of the chemistry, the translation, which would make the metaverse super immersive."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "I mean, that's exciting."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "You remove the barrier of language, period."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "Yeah, so when people think about translation, I think a lot of that is they're thinking about text to text, but speech to speech, I think is a whole nother thing."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And I mean, one of the big lessons on that, which I was referring to before is I think early models, it's like, all right, they take speech, they translate it to text, translate the text to another language and then kind of output that as speech in that language."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "And you don't wanna do that."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "You just wanna be able to go directly from speech in one language to speech in another language and build up the models to do that."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "And I mean, I think one of the, there have been, when you look at the progress in machine learning, there have been big advances in the techniques, some of the advances in self supervised learning, which I know you talked to Jan about and he's like one of the leading thinkers in this area."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "I just think that that stuff is really exciting, but then you couple that with the ability to just throw larger and larger amounts of compute at training these models."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And you can just do a lot of things that were harder to do before."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "But we're asking more of our systems too, right?"}, {"time": 5832, "text": "So if you think about the applications that we're gonna need for the metaverse, or think about it, okay, so let's talk about AR here for a second."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "You're gonna have these glasses, they're gonna look hopefully like a normal ish looking pair of glasses, but they're gonna be able to put holograms in the world and intermix virtual and physical objects in your scene."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "And one of the things that's gonna be unique about this compared to every other computing device that you've had before, is that this is gonna be the first computing device that has all the same signals about what's going on around you that you have."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "Right, so your phone, you can have it take a photo or a video, but I mean, these glasses are gonna, whenever you activate them, they're gonna be able to see what you see from your perspective, they're gonna be able to hear what you hear because the microphones and all that are gonna be right around where your ears are."}, {"time": 5885, "text": "So you're gonna want an AI assistant, that's a new kind of AI assistant that can basically help you process the world from this first person perspective or from the perspective that you have."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And the utility of that is gonna be huge, but the kinds of AI models that we're gonna need are going to be just, I don't know, there's a lot that we're gonna need to basically make advances in."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "But I mean, but that's why I think these concepts of the metaverse and the advances in AI are so fundamentally interlinked that I mean, they're kind of enabling each other."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "Yeah, like the world builder is a really cool idea."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "Like you can be like a Bob Ross, like I'm gonna put a little tree right here."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "I need a little tree, it's missing a little tree."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "And then, but at scale, like enriching your experience in all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "You mentioned the assistant too, that's really interesting how you can have AI assistants helping you out on different levels of sort of intimacy of communication."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "It could be just like scheduling or it could be like almost like therapy."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "Clearly I need some."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "So let me ask you, you're one of the most successful people ever."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "You've built an incredible company that has a lot of impact."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "How to live a life they can be proud of?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "How to build something that can have a big positive impact on the world?"}, {"time": 5971, "text": "Well, let's break that down."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "Cause I think you proud of, have a big positive impact."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Well, you're actually listening."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "And how to live your life are actually three different things that I think, I mean, they could line up, but, and also like what age of people are you talking to?"}, {"time": 5992, "text": "Cause I mean, I can like."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "High school and college."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "So you don't really know what you're doing, but your dream big."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "And you really have a chance to do something unprecedented."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "So I guess just to."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "Also for people my age."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "Okay, so let's maybe start with the kind of most philosophical and abstract version of this."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "Every night when I put my daughters to bed, we go through this thing and like, they call it the good night things."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "Cause we're basically what we talk about at night."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "And I just, I go through them."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "Sounds like a good show."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "The good night things."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "Priscilla's always asking, she's like, can I get good night things?"}, {"time": 6036, "text": "You go to bed too early."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "But it's, but I basically go through with Max and Augie, what are the things that are most important in life?"}, {"time": 6049, "text": "That I just, it's like, what do I want them to remember and just have like really ingrained in them as they grow up?"}, {"time": 6053, "text": "And it's health, right?"}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Making sure that you take care of yourself and keep yourself in good shape, loving friends and family, right?"}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Because having the relationships, the family and making time for friends, I think is perhaps one of the most important things."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And then the third is maybe a little more amorphous, but it is something that you're excited about for the future."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And when I'm talking to a four year old, often I'll ask her what she's excited about for tomorrow or the week ahead."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "But I think for most people, it's really hard."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "I mean, the world is a heavy place."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "And I think like the way that we navigate it is that we have things that we're looking forward to."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "So whether it is building AR glasses for the future or being able to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary with my wife that's coming up, it's like, I think people, you know, you have things that you're looking forward to."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "Or for the girls, it's often I want to see mom in the morning, right?"}, {"time": 6114, "text": "It's just, but it's like that's a really critical thing."}, {"time": 6117, "text": "And then the last thing is I ask them every day, what did you do today to help someone?"}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Because I just think that that's a really critical thing is like, it's easy to kind of get caught up in yourself and kind of stuff that's really far down the road, but like, did you do something just concrete today to help someone?"}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And, you know, it can just be as simple as, okay, yeah, I helped set the table for lunch, right?"}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Or, you know, this other kid in our school was having a hard time with something and I like helped explain it to him."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "But in that those are, that's sort of like, if you were to boil down my overall life philosophy into what I try to impart to my kids, those are the things that I think are really important."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "So, okay, so let's say college."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "So if you're a graduate in college, probably more practical advice, I'm always very focused on people."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "And I think the most important decision you're probably gonna make if you're in college is who you surround yourself with, because you become like the people you surround yourself with."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "And I sort of have this hiring heuristic at Metta, which is that I will only hire someone to work for me if I could see myself working for them."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "Not necessarily that I want them to run the company because I like my job, but in an alternate universe, if it was their company and I was looking to go work somewhere, would I be happy to work for them?"}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And I think that that's a helpful heuristic to help balance, you know, when you're building something like this, there's a lot of pressure to, you know, you wanna build out your team, because there's a lot of stuff that you need to get done."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "And everyone always says, don't compromise on quality, but there's this question of, okay, well, how do you know that someone is good enough?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "And I think my answer is, I would want someone to be on my team if I would work for them."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "But I think it's actually a pretty similar answer to like, if you were choosing friends or a partner or something like that."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "So when you're kind of in college, trying to figure out what your circle is gonna be, trying to figure out, you know, you're evaluating data, your circle is gonna be trying to figure out, you know, you're evaluating different job opportunities."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "But I don't know, I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they're basically building relationships with."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "I don't know what it says about me, but my place in Austin now has seven legged robots."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "So I'm surrounded myself by robots, which is probably something I should look into."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "What kind of world would you like to see your daughters grow up in, even after you're gone?"}, {"time": 6309, "text": "Well, I think one of the promises of all the stuff that is getting built now is that it can be a world where more people can just live out their imagination."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "One of my favorite quotes, I think it was attributed to Picasso, it's that all children are artists, and the challenge is how do you remain one when you grow up?"}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And if you have kids, this is pretty clear, I mean, they just have wonderful imaginations."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And part of what I think is gonna be great about the creator economy and the metaverse and all this stuff is this notion around that a lot more people in the future are gonna get to work doing creative stuff than what I think today we would just consider traditional labor or service."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "And I think that that's awesome."}, {"time": 6356, "text": "And that's a lot of what people are here to do is collaborate together, work together, think of things that you wanna build and go do it."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "And I don't know, one of the things that I just think is striking, so I teach my daughters some basic coding with Scratch."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "I mean, they're still obviously really young, but I think of coding as building, where it's like when I'm coding, I'm building something that I want to exist."}, {"time": 6382, "text": "But my youngest daughter, she's very musical and pretty artistic and she thinks about coding as art."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "She calls it code art, not the code, but the output of what she is making."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "It's like, she's just very interesting visually in what she can kind of output and how it can move around."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "And do we need to fix that?"}, {"time": 6407, "text": "Do we have to clap, Alexa?"}, {"time": 6409, "text": "Yeah, so I was just talking about Augie and her code art, but I mean, to me, this is like a beautiful thing, right?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "The notion that like for me, coding was this functional thing and I enjoyed it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it like helped build something utilitarian, but that for the next generation of people, it will be even more an expression of their kind of imagination and artistic sense for what they want to exist."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "So I don't know if that happens, if we can help bring about this world where a lot more people can, that that's like their existence going forward is being able to basically create and live out all these different kinds of art."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "I just think that that's like a beautiful and wonderful thing and will be very freeing for humanity to spend more of our time on the things that matter to us."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "Yeah, allow more and more people to express their art in the full meaning of that word."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "That's a beautiful vision."}, {"time": 6466, "text": "We mentioned that you are mortal."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "And are you afraid of it?"}, {"time": 6481, "text": "You didn't sign up for this on a podcast, did you?"}, {"time": 6483, "text": "No, I mean, it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "I mean, I'm definitely aware of it."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "I do a fair amount of like extreme sport type stuff."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "So like, so I'm definitely aware of it."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "And you're flirting with it a bit."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "I train hard."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I mean, so it's like, if I'm gonna go out in like a 15 foot wave."}, {"time": 6507, "text": "Go out big."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "Well, then it's like, all right, I'll make sure we have the right safety gear and like make sure that I'm like used to that spot and all that stuff."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But like, but you know, I mean, you."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "The risk is still there."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "You take some head blows along the way."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "Yes, but definitely aware of it."}, {"time": 6525, "text": "Definitely would like to stay safe."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "I have a lot of stuff that I want to build and want to."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "Does it freak you out that it's finite though?"}, {"time": 6535, "text": "That there's a deadline when it's all over and that there'll be a time when your daughters are around and you're gone?"}, {"time": 6543, "text": "That doesn't freak me out."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Constraints are helpful."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "Yeah, the finiteness makes ice cream taste more delicious somehow."}, {"time": 6561, "text": "The fact that it's gonna be over."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "There's something about that with the metaverse too."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "You want, we talked about this identity earlier, like having just one, like NFTs."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "There's something powerful about the constraint of finiteness or uniqueness."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "That this moment is singular in history."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "But I mean, a lot of, as you go through different waves of technology, I think a lot of what is interesting is what becomes in practice infinite or kind of there can be many, many of a thing and then what ends up still being constrained."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "So the metaverse should hopefully allow a very large number or maybe in practice, hopefully close to an infinite amount of expression and worlds, but we'll still only have a finite amount of time."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "I think living longer I think is good."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "And obviously all of my, our philanthropic work is, it's not focused on longevity, but it is focused on trying to achieve what I think is a possible goal in this century, which is to be able to cure, prevent or manage all diseases."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "So I certainly think people kind of getting sick and dying is a bad thing because, and I'm dedicating almost all of my capital towards advancing research in that area to push on that, which I mean, we could do a whole, another one of these podcasts about that because that's a fascinating topic."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "I mean, this is with your wife Priscilla Chan, you formed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, gave away 99% or pledged to give away 99% of Facebook non meta shares."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "I mean, like you said, we could talk forever about all the exciting things you're working on there, including the sort of moonshot of eradicating disease by the mid century marker."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "I don't actually know if you're gonna ever eradicate it, but I think you can get to a point where you can either cure things that happened, right?"}, {"time": 6680, "text": "So people get diseases, but you can cure them."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "Prevent is probably closest to eradication or just be able to manage as sort of like ongoing things that are not gonna ruin your life."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "And I think that that's possible."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "I think saying that there's gonna be no disease at all probably is not possible within the next several decades."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "Basic thing is increase the quality of life and maybe keep the finiteness because it makes everything taste more delicious."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "Maybe that's just being a romantic 20th century human."}, {"time": 6714, "text": "Maybe, but I mean, but it was an intentional decision to not focus on our philanthropy on like explicitly on longevity or living forever."}, {"time": 6726, "text": "If at the moment of your death, and by the way, I like that the lights went out when we started talking about death."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "You get to meet God."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "It does make it a lot more dramatic."}, {"time": 6737, "text": "I should get closer to the mic."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "At the moment of your death, you get to meet God and you get to ask one question."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "What question would you like to ask?"}, {"time": 6749, "text": "Or maybe a whole conversation."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "It's more dramatic when it's just one question."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "Well, if it's only one question and I died, I would just wanna know that Priscilla and my family, like if they were gonna be okay."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "That might depend on the circumstances of my death."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "But I think that in most circumstances that I can think of, that's probably the main thing that I would care about."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "Yeah, I think God will hear that question and be like, all right, fine, you get in."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "That's the right question to ask."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "The humility and selfishness."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "All right, you're in."},

of the things that I think I struggle with at least is on the one hand, that's probably the thing that's closest to me and maybe the most common human experience."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "But I don't know, one of the things that I just struggle with in terms of running this large enterprise is like, should the thing that I care more about be that responsibility?"}, {"time": 6824, "text": "And I think it's shifted over time."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "I mean, like before I really had a family that was like the only thing I cared about."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "And at this point, I mean, I care deeply about it, but yeah, I think that that's not as obvious of a question."}, {"time": 6846, "text": "Yeah, we humans are weird."}]}]
