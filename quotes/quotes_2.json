[{"title": "Ian Goodfellow: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) | Lex Fridman Podcast #19", "id": "Z6rxFNMGdn0", "quotes": [{"time": 360, "text": "Cognition, yes, I think so."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Consciousness, it's really hard to even define what we mean by that."}, {"time": 367, "text": "I guess there's, consciousness is often defined as things like having self awareness, and that's relatively easy to turn into something actionable for a computer scientist to reason about."}, {"time": 378, "text": "People also define consciousness in terms of having qualitative states of experience, like qualia, and there's all these philosophical problems, like could you imagine a zombie who does all the same information processing as a human, but doesn't really have the qualitative experiences that we have?"}, {"time": 394, "text": "That sort of thing, I have no idea how to formalize or turn it into a scientific question."}, {"time": 400, "text": "I don't know how you could run an experiment to tell whether a person is a zombie or not."}, {"time": 404, "text": "And similarly, I don't know how you could run an experiment to tell whether an advanced AI system had become conscious in the sense of qualia or not."}, {"time": 413, "text": "But in the more practical sense, like almost like self attention, you think consciousness and cognition can, in an impressive way, emerge from current types of architectures that we think of as learning."}, {"time": 426, "text": "Or if you think of consciousness in terms of self awareness and just making plans based on the fact that the agent itself exists in the world, reinforcement learning algorithms are already more or less forced to model the agent's effect on the environment."}, {"time": 443, "text": "So that more limited version of consciousness is already something that we get limited versions of with reinforcement learning algorithms if they're trained well."}, {"time": 454, "text": "But you say limited, so the big question really is how you jump from limited to human level, right?"}, {"time": 462, "text": "And whether it's possible, even just building common sense reasoning seems to be exceptionally difficult."}, {"time": 470, "text": "So if we scale things up, if we get much better on supervised learning, if we get better at labeling, if we get bigger data sets, more compute, do you think we'll start to see really impressive things that go from limited to something, echoes of human level cognition?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "I think so, yeah."}, {"time": 491, "text": "I'm optimistic about what can happen just with more computation and more data."}, {"time": 496, "text": "I do think it'll be important to get the right kind of data."}, {"time": 500, "text": "Today, most of the machine learning systems we train are mostly trained on one type of data for each model."}, {"time": 507, "text": "But the human brain, we get all of our different senses and we have many different experiences like riding a bike, driving a car, talking to people, reading."}, {"time": 519, "text": "I think when we get that kind of integrated data set, working with a machine learning model that can actually close the loop and interact, we may find that algorithms not so different from what we have today learn really interesting things when you scale them up a lot and train them on a large amount of multimodal data."}, {"time": 538, "text": "So multimodal is really interesting, but within, like you're working adversarial examples."}, {"time": 544, "text": "So selecting within modal, within one mode of data, selecting better at what are the difficult cases from which you're most useful to learn from."}, {"time": 556, "text": "Oh yeah, like could we get a whole lot of mileage out of designing a model that's resistant to adversarial examples or something like that?"}, {"time": 564, "text": "Right, that's the question."}, {"time": 566, "text": "My thinking on that has evolved a lot over the last few years."}, {"time": 569, "text": "When I first started to really invest in studying adversarial examples, I was thinking of it mostly as adversarial examples reveal a big problem with machine learning and we would like to close the gap between how machine learning models respond to adversarial examples and how humans respond."}, {"time": 587, "text": "After studying the problem more, I still think that adversarial examples are important."}, {"time": 591, "text": "I think of them now more of as a security liability than as an issue that necessarily shows there's something uniquely wrong with machine learning as opposed to humans."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Also, do you see them as a tool to improve the performance of the system?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "Not on the security side, but literally just accuracy."}, {"time": 610, "text": "I do see them as a kind of tool on that side, but maybe not quite as much as I used to think."}, {"time": 616, "text": "We've started to find that there's a trade off between accuracy on adversarial examples and accuracy on clean examples."}, {"time": 624, "text": "Back in 2014, when I did the first adversarily trained classifier that showed resistance to some kinds of adversarial examples, it also got better at the clean data on MNIST."}, {"time": 636, "text": "And that's something we've replicated several times on MNIST, that when we train against weak adversarial examples, MNIST classifiers get more accurate."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So far that hasn't really held up on other data sets and hasn't held up when we train against stronger adversaries."}, {"time": 650, "text": "It seems like when you confront a really strong adversary, you tend to have to give something up."}, {"time": 659, "text": "But it's such a compelling idea because it feels like that's how us humans learn is through the difficult cases."}, {"time": 666, "text": "We try to think of what would we screw up and then we make sure we fix that."}, {"time": 671, "text": "It's also in a lot of branches of engineering, you do a worst case analysis and make sure that your system will work in the worst case."}, {"time": 678, "text": "And then that guarantees that it'll work in all of the messy average cases that happen when you go out into a really randomized world."}, {"time": 687, "text": "Yeah, with driving with autonomous vehicles, there seems to be a desire to just look for, think adversarially, try to figure out how to mess up the system."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And if you can be robust to all those difficult cases, then you can, it's a hand wavy empirical way to show your system is safe."}, {"time": 707, "text": "Today, most adversarial example research isn't really focused on a particular use case, but there are a lot of different use cases where you'd like to make sure that the adversary can't interfere with the operation of your system."}, {"time": 720, "text": "Like in finance, if you have an algorithm making trades for you, people go to a lot of an effort to obfuscate their algorithm."}, {"time": 726, "text": "That's both to protect their IP because you don't want to research and develop a profitable trading algorithm then have somebody else capture the gains."}, {"time": 736, "text": "But it's at least partly because you don't want people to make adversarial examples that fool your algorithm into making bad trades."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Or I guess one area that's been popular in the academic literature is speech recognition."}, {"time": 750, "text": "If you use speech recognition to hear an audio wave form and then turn that into a command that a phone executes for you, you don't want a malicious adversary to be able to produce audio that gets interpreted as malicious commands, especially if a human in the room doesn't realize that something like that is happening."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And speech recognition, has there been much success in being able to create adversarial examples that fool the system?"}, {"time": 779, "text": "Yeah, actually."}, {"time": 780, "text": "I guess the first work that I'm aware of is a paper called Hidden Voice Commands that came out in 2016, I believe."}, {"time": 788, "text": "And they were able to show that they could make sounds that are not understandable by a human but are recognized as the target phrase that the attacker wants the phone to recognize it as."}, {"time": 801, "text": "Since then, things have gotten a little bit better on the attacker's side when worse on the defender's side."}, {"time": 808, "text": "It's become possible to make sounds that sound like normal speech but are actually interpreted as a different sentence than the human hears."}, {"time": 820, "text": "The level of perceptibility of the adversarial perturbation is still kind of high."}, {"time": 826, "text": "When you listen to the recording, it sounds like there's some noise in the background, just like rustling sounds."}, {"time": 832, "text": "But those rustling sounds are actually the adversarial perturbation that makes the phone hear a completely different sentence."}, {"time": 838, "text": "Yeah, that's so fascinating."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Peter Norvig mentioned that you're writing the deep learning chapter for the fourth edition of the Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach book."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So how do you even begin summarizing the field of deep learning in a chapter?"}, {"time": 853, "text": "Well, in my case, I waited like a year before I actually wrote anything."}, {"time": 859, "text": "Even having written a full length textbook before, it's still pretty intimidating to try to start writing just one chapter that covers everything."}, {"time": 871, "text": "One thing that helped me make that plan was actually the experience of having written the full book before and then watching how the field changed after the book came out."}, {"time": 881, "text": "I've realized there's a lot of topics that were maybe extraneous in the first book and just seeing what stood the test of a few years of being published and what seems a little bit less important to have included now helped me pare down the topics I wanted to cover for the book."}, {"time": 896, "text": "It's also really nice now that the field is kind of stabilized to the point where some core ideas from the 1980s are still used today."}, {"time": 904, "text": "When I first started studying machine learning, almost everything from the 1980s had been rejected and now some of it has come back."}, {"time": 911, "text": "So that stuff that's really stood the test of time is what I focused on putting into the book."}, {"time": 916, "text": "There's also, I guess, two different philosophies about how you might write a book."}, {"time": 923, "text": "One philosophy is you try to write a reference that covers everything."}, {"time": 926, "text": "The other philosophy is you try to provide a high level summary that gives people the language to understand a field and tells them what the most important concepts are."}, {"time": 935, "text": "The first deep learning book that I wrote with Joshua and Aaron was somewhere between the two philosophies, that it's trying to be both a reference and an introductory guide."}, {"time": 945, "text": "Writing this chapter for Russell Norvig's book, I was able to focus more on just a concise introduction of the key concepts and the language you need to read about them more."}, {"time": 955, "text": "In a lot of cases, I actually just wrote paragraphs that said, here's a rapidly evolving area that you should pay attention to."}, {"time": 962, "text": "It's pointless to try to tell you what the latest and best version of a learn to learn model is."}, {"time": 971, "text": "I can point you to a paper that's recent right now, but there isn't a whole lot of a reason to delve into exactly what's going on with the latest learning to learn approach or the latest module produced by a learning to learn algorithm."}, {"time": 985, "text": "You should know that learning to learn is a thing and that it may very well be the source of the latest and greatest convolutional net or recurrent net module that you would want to use in your latest project."}, {"time": 996, "text": "But there isn't a lot of point in trying to summarize exactly which architecture and which learning approach got to which level of performance."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "So you maybe focus more on the basics of the methodology."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "So from back propagation to feed forward to recurrent neural networks, convolutional, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1016, "text": "So if I were to ask you, I remember I took algorithms and data structures algorithms course."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "I remember the professor asked, what is an algorithm?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And yelled at everybody in a good way that nobody was answering it correctly."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Everybody knew what the algorithm, it was graduate course."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Everybody knew what an algorithm was, but they weren't able to answer it well."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So let me ask you in that same spirit, what is deep learning?"}, {"time": 1044, "text": "I would say deep learning is any kind of machine learning that involves learning parameters of more than one consecutive step."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So that, I mean, shallow learning is things where you learn a lot of operations that happen in parallel."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "You might have a system that makes multiple steps."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Like you might have hand designed feature extractors, but really only one step is learned."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Deep learning is anything where you have multiple operations in sequence, and that includes the things that are really popular today, like convolutional networks and recurrent networks."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "But it also includes some of the things that have died out like Bolton machines, where we weren't using back propagation."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "Today, I hear a lot of people define deep learning as gradient descent applied to these differentiable functions."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And I think that's a legitimate usage of the term."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "It's just different from the way that I use the term myself."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So what's an example of deep learning that is not gradient descent and differentiable functions?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "In your, I mean, not specifically perhaps, but more even looking into the future, what's your thought about that space of approaches?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Yeah, so I tend to think of machine learning algorithms as decomposed into really three different pieces."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "There's the model, which can be something like a neural net or a Bolton machine or a recurrent model."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And that basically just describes how do you take data and how do you take parameters?"}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And what function do you use to make a prediction given the data and the parameters?"}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Another piece of the learning algorithm is the optimization algorithm."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Or not every algorithm can be really described in terms of optimization, but what's the algorithm for updating the parameters or updating whatever the state of the network is?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "And then the last part is the data set, like how do you actually represent the world as it comes into your machine learning system?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So I think of deep learning as telling us something about what does the model look like?"}, {"time": 1179, "text": "And basically to qualify as deep, I say that it just has to have multiple layers."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "That can be multiple steps in a feed forward differentiable computation."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "That can be multiple layers in a graphical model."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "There's a lot of ways that you could satisfy me that something has multiple steps that are each parameterized separately."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "I think of gradient descent as being all about that other piece, the how do you actually update the parameters piece?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So you could imagine having a deep model like a convolutional net and training it with something like evolution or a genetic algorithm."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And I would say that still qualifies as deep learning."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "And then in terms of models that aren't necessarily differentiable, I guess Bolton machines are probably the main example of something where you can't really take a derivative and use that for the learning process."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "But you can still argue that the model has many steps of processing that it applies when you run inference in the model."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So it's the steps of processing that's key."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So Jeff Hinton suggests that we need to throw away back propagation and start all over."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "What do you think about that?"}, {"time": 1246, "text": "What could an alternative direction of training neural networks look like?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "I don't know that back propagation is gonna go away entirely."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Most of the time when we decide that a machine learning algorithm isn't on the critical path to research for improving AI, the algorithm doesn't die."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It just becomes used for some specialized set of things."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "A lot of algorithms like logistic regression don't seem that exciting to AI researchers who are working on things like speech recognition or autonomous cars today."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "But there's still a lot of use for logistic regression and things like analyzing really noisy data in medicine and finance or making really rapid predictions in really time limited contexts."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "So I think back propagation and gradient descent are around to stay, but they may not end up being everything that we need to get to real human level or super human AI."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Are you optimistic about us discovering back propagation has been around for a few decades?"}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So are you optimistic about us as a community being able to discover something better?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Yeah, I am."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "I think we likely will find something that works better."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "You could imagine things like having stacks of models where some of the lower level models predict parameters of the higher level models."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And so at the top level, you're not learning in terms of literally calculating gradients, but just predicting how different values will perform."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You can kind of see that already in some areas like Bayesian optimization, where you have a Gaussian process that predicts how well different parameter values will perform."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "We already use those kinds of algorithms for things like hyper parameter optimization."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And in general, we know a lot of things other than back prop that work really well for specific problems."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "The main thing we haven't found is a way of taking one of these other non back prop based algorithms and having it really advanced the state of the art on an AI level problem."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "But I wouldn't be surprised if eventually we find that some of these algorithms that even the ones that already exist, not even necessarily new one, we might find some way of customizing one of these algorithms to do something really interesting at the level of cognition or the level of, I think one system that we really don't have working quite right yet is like short term memory."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "We have things like LSTMs, they're called long short term memory."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "They still don't do quite what a human does with short term memory."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Like gradient descent to learn a specific fact has to do multiple steps on that fact."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Like if I tell you the meeting today is at 3 p.m., I don't need to say over and over again, it's at 3 p.m., it's at 3 p.m., it's at 3 p.m., it's at 3 p.m. for you to do a gradient step on each one."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "You just hear it once and you remember it."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "There's been some work on things like self attention and attention like mechanisms, like the neural Turing machine that can write to memory cells and update themselves with facts like that right away."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "But I don't think we've really nailed it yet."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And that's one area where I'd imagine that new optimization algorithms or different ways of applying existing optimization algorithms could give us a way of just lightning fast updating the state of a machine learning system to contain a specific fact like that without needing to have it presented over and over and over again."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So some of the success of symbolic systems in the 80s is they were able to assemble these kinds of facts better."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "But there's a lot of expert input required and it's very limited in that sense."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Do you ever look back to that as something that we'll have to return to eventually?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Sort of dust off the book from the shelf and think about how we build knowledge, representation, knowledge base."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Like will we have to use graph searches?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Graph searches, right."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And like first order logic and entailment and things like that."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "That kind of thing, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "In my particular line of work, which has mostly been machine learning security and also generative modeling, I haven't usually found myself moving in that direction."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "For generative models, I could see a little bit of, it could be useful if you had something like a differentiable knowledge base or some other kind of knowledge base where it's possible for some of our fuzzier machine learning algorithms to interact with a knowledge base."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "I mean, your network is kind of like that."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "It's a differentiable knowledge base of sorts."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "If we had a really easy way of giving feedback to machine learning models, that would clearly help a lot with generative models."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And so you could imagine one way of getting there would be get a lot better at natural language processing."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "But another way of getting there would be take some kind of knowledge base and figure out a way for it to actually interact with a neural network."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Being able to have a chat with a neural network."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So like one thing in generative models we see a lot today is you'll get things like faces that are not symmetrical, like people that have two eyes that are different colors."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "I mean, there are people with eyes that are different colors in real life, but not nearly as many of them as you tend to see in the machine learning generated data."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So if you had either a knowledge base that could contain the fact, people's faces are generally approximately symmetric and eye color is especially likely to be the same on both sides."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Being able to just inject that hint into the machine learning model without it having to discover that itself after studying a lot of data would be a really useful feature."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "I could see a lot of ways of getting there without bringing back some of the 1980s technology, but I also see some ways that you could imagine extending the 1980s technology to play nice with neural nets and have it help get there."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So you talked about the story of you coming up with the idea of GANs at a bar with some friends."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "You were arguing that this, you know, GANs would work, generative adversarial networks, and the others didn't think so."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Then you went home at midnight, coded it up, and it worked."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "So if I was a friend of yours at the bar, I would also have doubts."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "It's a really nice idea, but I'm very skeptical that it would work."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "What was the basis of their skepticism?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "What was the basis of your intuition why it should work?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "I don't want to be someone who goes around promoting alcohol for the purposes of science, but in this case, I do actually think that drinking helped a little bit."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "When your inhibitions are lowered, you're more willing to try out things that you wouldn't try out otherwise."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So I have noticed in general that I'm less prone to shooting down some of my own ideas when I have had a little bit to drink."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "I think if I had had that idea at lunchtime, I probably would have thought, it's hard enough to train one neural net, you can't train a second neural net in the inner loop of the outer neural net."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "That was basically my friend's objection, was that trying to train two neural nets at the same time would be too hard."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So it was more about the training process, unless, so my skepticism would be, you know, I'm sure you could train it, but the thing it would converge to would not be able to generate anything reasonable, any kind of reasonable realism."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Yeah, so part of what all of us were thinking about when we had this conversation was deep Bolton machines, which a lot of us in the lab, including me, were a big fan of deep Bolton machines at the time."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "They involved two separate processes running at the same time."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "One of them is called the positive phase, where you load data into the model and tell the model to make the data more likely."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "The other one is called the negative phase, where you draw samples from the model and tell the model to make those samples less likely."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "In a deep Bolton machine, it's not trivial to generate a sample."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "You have to actually run an iterative process that gets better and better samples coming closer and closer to the distribution the model represents."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So during the training process, you're always running these two systems at the same time, one that's updating the parameters of the model and another one that's trying to generate samples from the model."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "And they worked really well in things like MNIST, but a lot of us in the lab, including me, had tried to get deep Bolton machines to scale past MNIST to things like generating color photos, and we just couldn't get the two processes to stay synchronized."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "So when I had the idea for GANs, a lot of people thought that the discriminator would have more or less the same problem as the negative phase in the Bolton machine, that trying to train the discriminator in the inner loop, you just couldn't get it to keep up with the generator in the outer loop, and that would prevent it from converging to anything useful."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Yeah, I share that intuition."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But turns out to not be the case."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "A lot of the time with machine learning algorithms, it's really hard to predict ahead of time how well they'll actually perform."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "You have to just run the experiment and see what happens."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And I would say I still today don't have like one factor I can put my finger on and say, this is why GANs worked for photo generation and deep Bolton machines don't."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "There are a lot of theory papers showing that under some theoretical settings, the GAN algorithm does actually converge, but those settings are restricted enough that they don't necessarily explain the whole picture in terms of all the results that we see in practice."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So taking a step back, can you, in the same way as we talked about deep learning, can you tell me what generative adversarial networks are?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Yeah, so generative adversarial networks are a particular kind of generative model."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "A generative model is a machine learning model that can train on some set of data."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Like, so you have a collection of photos of cats and you want to generate more photos of cats, or you want to estimate a probability distribution over cats."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "So you can ask how likely it is that some new image is a photo of a cat."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "GANs are one way of doing this."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Some generative models are good at creating new data."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Other generative models are good at estimating that density function and telling you how likely particular pieces of data are to come from the same distribution as the training data."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "GANs are more focused on generating samples rather than estimating the density function."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "There are some kinds of GANs like FlowGAN that can do both, but mostly GANs are about generating samples, generating new photos of cats that look realistic."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And they do that completely from scratch."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It's analogous to human imagination."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "When a GAN creates a new image of a cat, it's using a neural network to produce a cat that has not existed before."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "It isn't doing something like compositing photos together."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "You're not literally taking the eye off of one cat and the ear off of another cat."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "It's more of this digestive process where the neural net trains in a lot of data and comes up with some representation of the probability distribution and generates entirely new cats."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "There are a lot of different ways of building a generative model."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "What's specific to GANs is that we have a two player game in the game theoretic sense."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And as the players in this game compete, one of them becomes able to generate realistic data."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "The first player is called the generator."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "It produces output data such as just images, for example."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And at the start of the learning process, it'll just produce completely random images."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "The other player is called the discriminator."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "The discriminator takes images as input and guesses whether they're real or fake."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "You train it both on real data, so photos that come from your training set, actual photos of cats, and you train it to say that those are real."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "You also train it on images that come from the generator network and you train it to say that those are fake."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "As the two players compete in this game, the discriminator tries to become better at recognizing whether images are real or fake."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And the generator becomes better at fooling the discriminator into thinking that its outputs are real."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And you can analyze this through the language of game theory and find that there's a Nash equilibrium where the generator has captured the correct probability distribution."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "So in the cat example, it makes perfectly realistic cat photos."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And the discriminator is unable to do better than random guessing because all the samples coming from both the data and the generator look equally likely to have come from either source."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "So do you ever sit back and does it just blow your mind that this thing works?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "So from very, so it's able to estimate that density function enough to generate realistic images."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "I mean, does it, yeah."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "Do you ever sit back and think how does this even, why, this is quite incredible, especially where GANs have gone in terms of realism."},

memorize the training data."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "Models that are based on maximizing the likelihood, the way that you obtain the maximum likelihood for a specific training set is you assign all of your probability mass to the training examples and nowhere else."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "For GANs, the game is played using a training set."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "So the way that you become unbeatable in the game is you literally memorize training examples."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "One of my former interns wrote a paper, his name is Vaishnav Nagarajan, and he showed that it's actually hard for the generator to memorize the training data, hard in a statistical learning theory sense, that you can actually create reasons for why it would require quite a lot of learning steps and a lot of observations of different latent variables before you could memorize the training data."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "That still doesn't really explain why when you produce samples that are new, why do you get compelling images rather than just garbage that's different from the training set."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And I don't think we really have a good answer for that, especially if you think about how many possible images are out there and how few images the generative model sees during training."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "It seems just unreasonable that generative models create new images as well as they do, especially considering that we're basically training them to memorize rather than generalize."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I think part of the answer is there's a paper called Deep Image Prior where they show that you can take a convolutional net and you don't even need to learn the parameters of it at all, you just use the model architecture."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And it's already useful for things like inpainting images."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "I think that shows us that the convolutional network architecture captures something really important about the structure of images."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And we don't need to actually use the learning to capture all the information coming out of the convolutional net."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "That would imply that it would be much harder to make generative models in other domains."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So far, we're able to make reasonable speech models and things like that."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "But to be honest, we haven't actually explored a whole lot of different data sets all that much."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "We don't, for example, see a lot of deep learning models of like biology data sets where you have lots of microarrays measuring the amount of different enzymes and things like that."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So we may find that some of the progress that we've seen for images and speech turns out to really rely heavily on the model architecture."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And we were able to do what we did for vision by trying to reverse engineer the human visual system."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "And maybe it'll turn out that we can't just use that same trick for arbitrary kinds of data."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Right, so there's aspect to the human vision system, the hardware of it, that makes it without learning, without cognition, just makes it really effective at detecting the patterns we see in the visual world."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "Yeah, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "What, in a big, quick overview, in your view, what types of GANs are there and what other generative models besides GANs are there?"}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Yeah, so it's maybe a little bit easier to start with what kinds of generative models are there other than GANs."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So most generative models are likelihood based where to train them, you have a model that tells you how much probability it assigns to a particular example and you just maximize the probability assigned to all the training examples."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "It turns out that it's hard to design a model that can create really complicated images or really complicated audio waveforms and still have it be possible to estimate the likelihood function from a computational point of view."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Most interesting models that you would just write down intuitively, it turns out that it's almost impossible to calculate the amount of probability they assign to a particular point."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "So there's a few different schools of generative models in the likelihood family."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "One approach is to very carefully design the model so that it is computationally tractable to measure the density it assigns to a particular point."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So there are things like autoregressive models, like PixelCNN, those basically break down the probability distribution into a product over every single feature."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "So for an image, you estimate the probability of each pixel given all of the pixels that came before it."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "There's tricks where if you want to measure the density function, you can actually calculate the density for all these pixels more or less in parallel."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "Generating the image still tends to require you to go one pixel at a time, and that can be very slow."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "But there are, again, tricks for doing this in a hierarchical pattern where you can keep the runtime under control."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "Are the quality of the images it generates, putting runtime aside, pretty good?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "They're reasonable, yeah."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "I would say a lot of the best results are from GANs these days, but it can be hard to tell how much of that is based on who's studying which type of algorithm, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "The amount of effort invested in a particular."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "Yeah, or like the kind of expertise."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So a lot of people who've traditionally been excited about graphics or art and things like that have gotten interested in GANs."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And to some extent, it's hard to tell are GANs doing better because they have a lot of graphics and art experts behind them, or are GANs doing better because they're more computationally efficient, or are GANs doing better because they prioritize the realism of samples over the accuracy of the density function."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "I think all of those are potentially valid explanations, and it's hard to tell."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So can you give a brief history of GANs from 2014?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Were you paper 13?"}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Yeah, so a few highlights."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "In the first paper, we just showed that GANs basically work."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "If you look back at the samples we had now, they look terrible."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "On the CIFAR 10 data set, you can't even recognize objects in them."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "Your paper, sorry, you used CIFAR 10?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "We used MNIST, which is little handwritten digits."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "We used the Toronto Face database, which is small grayscale photos of faces."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "We did have recognizable faces."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "My colleague Bing Xu put together the first GAN face model for that paper."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "We also had the CIFAR 10 data set, which is things like very small 32 by 32 pixels of cars and cats and dogs."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "For that, we didn't get recognizable objects, but all the deep learning people back then were really used to looking at these failed samples and kind of reading them like tea leaves."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "And people who are used to reading the tea leaves recognize that our tea leaves at least look different."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Maybe not necessarily better, but there was something unusual about them."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "And that got a lot of us excited."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "One of the next really big steps was LAPGAN by Emily Denton and Sumit Chintala at Facebook AI Research, where they actually got really good high resolution photos working with GANs for the first time."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "They had a complicated system where they generated the image starting at low res and then scaling up to high res, but they were able to get it to work."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And then in 2015, I believe later that same year, Alec Radford and Sumit Chintala and Luke Metz published the DCGAN paper, which it stands for deep convolutional GAN."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "It's kind of a non unique name because these days basically all GANs and even some before that were deep and convolutional, but they just kind of picked a name for a really great recipe where they were able to actually using only one model instead of a multi step process, actually generate realistic images of faces and things like that."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "That was sort of like the beginning of the Cambrian explosion of GANs."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Like once you had animals that had a backbone, you suddenly got lots of different versions of fish and four legged animals and things like that."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So DCGAN became kind of the backbone for many different models that came out."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "It's used as a baseline even still."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And so from there, I would say some interesting things we've seen are there's a lot you can say about how just the quality of standard image generation GANs has increased, but what's also maybe more interesting on an intellectual level is how the things you can use GANs for has also changed."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "One thing is that you can use them to learn classifiers without having to have class labels for every example in your training set."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "So that's called semi supervised learning."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "My colleague at OpenAI, Tim Solomons, who's at Brain now, wrote a paper called Improve Techniques for Training GANs."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "I'm a coauthor on this paper, but I can't claim any credit for this particular part."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "One thing he showed in the paper is that you can take the GAN discriminator and use it as a classifier that actually tells you, this image is a cat, this image is a dog, this image is a car, this image is a truck, and so on."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "Not just to say whether the image is real or fake, but if it is real to say specifically what kind of object it is."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And he found that you can train these classifiers with far fewer labeled examples than traditional classifiers."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "So if you supervise based on also not just your discrimination ability, but your ability to classify, you're going to do much, you're going to converge much faster to being effective at being a discriminator."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "So for example, for the MNIST dataset, you want to look at an image of a handwritten digit and say whether it's a zero, a one, or a two, and so on."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "To get down to less than 1% accuracy required around 60,000 examples until maybe about 2014 or so."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "In 2016 with this semi supervised GAN project, Tim was able to get below 1% error using only 100 labeled examples."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "So that was about a 600X decrease in the amount of labels that he needed."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "He's still using more images than that, but he doesn't need to have each of them labeled as this one's a one, this one's a two, this one's a zero, and so on."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Then to be able to, for GANs to be able to generate recognizable objects, so objects from a particular class, you still need labeled data because you need to know what it means to be a particular class cat, dog."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "How do you think we can move away from that?"}, {"time": 2684, "text": "Yeah, some researchers at Brain Zurich actually just released a really great paper on semi supervised GANs where their goal isn't to classify, it's to make recognizable objects despite not having a lot of labeled data."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "They were working off of DeepMind's BigGAN project and they showed that they can match the performance of BigGAN using only 10%, I believe, of the labels."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "BigGAN was trained on the ImageNet data set, which is about 1.2 million images and had all of them labeled."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "This latest project from Brain Zurich shows that they're able to get away with only having about 10% of the images labeled."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "If you train a GAN with no class labels, you tend to get things that look sort of like grass or water or brick or dirt, but without necessarily a lot going on in them."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I think that's partly because if you look at a large ImageNet image, the object doesn't necessarily occupy the whole image."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And so you learn to create realistic sets of pixels, but you don't necessarily learn that the object is the star of the show and you want it to be in every image you make."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, I've heard you talk about the horse, the zebra cycle GAN mapping and how it turns out, again, thought provoking that horses are usually on grass and zebras are usually on drier terrain."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So when you're doing that kind of generation, you're going to end up generating greener horses or whatever, so those are connected together."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "It's not just, you're not able to segment, be able to generate in a segment away."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "So are there other types of games you come across in your mind that neural networks can play with each other to be able to solve problems?"}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Yeah, the one that I spend most of my time on is in security."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "You can model most interactions as a game where there's attackers trying to break your system and you're the defender trying to build a resilient system."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "There's also domain adversarial learning, which is an approach to domain adaptation that looks really a lot like GANs."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "The authors had the idea before the GAN paper came out, their paper came out a little bit later and they're very nice and cited the GAN paper, but I know that they actually had the idea before it came out."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Domain adaptation is when you want to train a machine learning model in one setting called a domain and then deploy it in another domain later."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "And you would like it to perform well in the new domain, even though the new domain is different from how it was trained."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "So for example, you might want to train on a really clean image data set like ImageNet, but then deploy on users phones where the user is taking pictures in the dark and pictures while moving quickly and just pictures that aren't really centered or composed all that well."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "When you take a normal machine learning model, it often degrades really badly when you move to the new domain because it looks so different from what the model was trained on."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Domain adaptation algorithms try to smooth out that gap and the domain adversarial approach is based on training a feature extractor where the features have the same statistics regardless of which domain you extracted them on."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So in the domain adversarial game, you have one player that's a feature extractor and another player that's a domain recognizer."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "The domain recognizer wants to look at the output of the feature extractor and guess which of the two domains the features came from."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So it's a lot like the real versus fake discriminator in GANs and then the feature extractor, you can think of as loosely analogous to the generator in GANs, except what it's trying to do here is both fool the domain recognizer into not knowing which domain the data came from and also extract features that are good for classification."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So at the end of the day, in the cases where it works out, you can actually get features that work about the same in both domains."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "Sometimes this has a drawback where in order to make things work the same in both domains, it just gets worse at the first one."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "But there are a lot of cases where it actually works out well on both."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So do you think of GANs being useful in the context of data augmentation?"}, {"time": 2975, "text": "Yeah, one thing you could hope for with GANs is you could imagine I've got a limited training set and I'd like to make more training data to train something else like a classifier."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "You could train the GAN on the training set and then create more data and then maybe the classifier would perform better on the test set after training on this bigger GAN generated data set."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So that's the simplest version of something you might hope would work."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "I've never heard of that particular approach working, but I think there's some closely related things that I think could work in the future and some that actually already have worked."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "So if we think a little bit about what we'd be hoping for if we use the GAN to make more training data, we're hoping that the GAN will generalize to new examples better than the classifier would have generalized if it was trained on the same data."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "And I don't know of any reason to believe that the GAN would generalize better than the classifier would, but what we might hope for is that the GAN could generalize differently from a specific classifier."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So one thing I think is worth trying that I haven't personally tried but someone could try is what if you trained a whole lot of different generative models on the same training set, create samples from all of them and then train a classifier on that?"}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Because each of the generative models might generalize in a slightly different way."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "They might capture many different axes of variation that one individual model wouldn't and then the classifier can capture all of those ideas by training in all of their data."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So it'd be a little bit like making an ensemble of classifiers."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "And I think that... Ensemble of GANs in a way."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "I think that could generalize better."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "The other thing that GANs are really good for is not necessarily generating new data that's exactly like what you already have, but by generating new data that has different properties from the data you already had."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "One thing that you can do is you can create differentially private data."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "So suppose that you have something like medical records and you don't want to train a classifier on the medical records and then publish the classifier because someone might be able to reverse engineer some of the medical records you trained on."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "There's a paper from Casey Green's lab that shows how you can train a GAN using differential privacy."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "And then the samples from the GAN still have the same differential privacy guarantees as the parameters of the GAN."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So you can make fake patient data for other researchers to use."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And they can do almost anything they want with that data because it doesn't come from real people."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "And the differential privacy mechanism gives you clear guarantees on how much the original people's data has been protected."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "That's really interesting, actually."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "I haven't heard you talk about that before."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "In terms of fairness, I've seen from AAAI, your talk, how can adversarial machine learning help models be more fair with respect to sensitive variables?"}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Yeah, so there's a paper from Amos Starkey's lab about how to learn machine learning models that are incapable of using specific variables."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "So say, for example, you wanted to make predictions that are not affected by gender."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "It isn't enough to just leave gender out of the input to the model."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "You can often infer gender from a lot of other characteristics."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Like say that you have the person's name, but you're not told their gender."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Well, if their name is Ian, they're kind of obviously a man."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "So what you'd like to do is make a machine learning model that can still take in a lot of different attributes and make a really accurate informed prediction, but be confident that it isn't reverse engineering gender or another sensitive variable internally."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "You can do that using something very similar to the domain adversarial approach, where you have one player that's a feature extractor and another player that's a feature analyzer."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "And you want to make sure that the feature analyzer is not able to guess the value of the sensitive variable that you're trying to keep private."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "Right, that's, yeah, I love this approach."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "So yeah, with the feature, you're not able to infer the sensitive variables."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Brilliant, that's quite brilliant and simple actually."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Another way I think that GANs in particular could be used for fairness would be to make something like a CycleGAN, where you can take data from one domain and convert it into another."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "We've seen CycleGAN turning horses into zebras."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "We've seen other unsupervised GANs made by Mingyu Liu doing things like turning day photos into night photos."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "I think for fairness, you could imagine taking records for people in one group and transforming them into analogous people in another group and testing to see if they're treated equitably across those two groups."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "There's a lot of things that'd be hard to get right to make sure that the conversion process itself is fair."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "And I don't think it's anywhere near something that we could actually use yet, but if you could design that conversion process very carefully, it might give you a way of doing audits where you say, what if we took people from this group, converted them into equivalent people in another group, does the system actually treat them how it ought to?"}, {"time": 3278, "text": "That's also really interesting."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "You know, in popular press and in general, in our imagination, you think, well, GANs are able to generate data and you start to think about deep fakes or being able to sort of maliciously generate data that fakes the identity of other people."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Is this something of a concern to you?"}, {"time": 3303, "text": "Is this something, if you look 10, 20 years into the future, is that something that pops up in your work, in the work of the community that's working on generating models?"}, {"time": 3313, "text": "I'm a lot less concerned about 20 years from now than the next few years."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I think there'll be a kind of bumpy cultural transition as people encounter this idea that there can be very realistic videos and audio that aren't real."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "I think 20 years from now, people will mostly understand that you shouldn't believe something is real just because you saw a video of it."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "People will expect to see that it's been cryptographically signed or have some other mechanism to make them believe that the content is real."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "There's already people working on this."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Like there's a startup called Truepick that provides a lot of mechanisms for authenticating that an image is real."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "They're maybe not quite up to having a state actor try to evade their verification techniques, but it's something that people are already working on and I think we'll get right eventually."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "So you think authentication will eventually win out."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "So being able to authenticate that this is real and this is not."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "As opposed to GANs just getting better and better or generative models being able to get better and better to where the nature of what is real is normal."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "I don't think we'll ever be able to look at the pixels of a photo and tell you for sure that it's real or not real."},

able to fool your fake detector and your fake detector says this image is not fake, then it's even more credible than if you've never made a fake detector in the first place."}, {"time": 3406, "text":

3419, "text": "I also think we will likely get better authentication systems where, imagine that every phone cryptographically signs everything that comes out of it."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "You wouldn't be able to conclusively tell that an image was real, but you would be able to tell somebody who knew the appropriate private key for this phone was actually able to sign this image and upload it to this server at this timestamp."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Okay, so you could imagine maybe you make phones that have the private keys hardware embedded in them."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "If like a state security agency really wants to infiltrate the company, they could probably plant a private key of their choice or break open the chip and learn the private key or something like that."},

"So you mentioned the beer and the bar and the new ideas."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "You were able to implement this or come up with this new idea pretty quickly and implement it pretty quickly."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "Do you think there's still many such groundbreaking ideas in deep learning that could be developed so quickly?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "Yeah, I do think that there are a lot of ideas that can be developed really quickly."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "GANs were probably a little bit of an outlier on the whole like one hour timescale."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "But just in terms of like low resource ideas where you do something really different on the algorithm scale and get a big payback."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "I think it's not as likely that you'll see that in terms of things like core machine learning technologies like a better classifier or a better reinforcement learning algorithm or a better generative model."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "If I had the GAN idea today, it would be a lot harder to prove that it was useful than it was back in 2014 because I would need to get it running on something like ImageNet or Celeb A at high resolution."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "You know, those take a while to train."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "You couldn't train it in an hour and know that it was something really new and exciting."}, {"time": 3541, "text":

resources."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "What's your intuition about what areas of machine learning are ripe for this?"}, {"time": 3557, "text": "Yeah, so I think fairness and interpretability are areas where we just really don't have any idea how anything should be done yet."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Like for interpretability, I don't think we even have the right definitions."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And even just defining a really useful concept, you don't even need to run any experiments, could have a huge impact on the field."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "We've seen that, for example, in differential privacy that Cynthia Dwork and her collaborators made this technical definition of privacy where before a lot of things were really mushy."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "And then with that definition, you could actually design randomized algorithms for accessing databases and guarantee that they preserved individual people's privacy in like a mathematical quantitative sense."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "Right now, we all talk a lot about how interpretable different machine learning algorithms are, but it's really just people's opinion."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "And everybody probably has a different idea of what interpretability means in their head."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "If we could define some concept related to interpretability that's actually measurable, that would be a huge leap forward even without a new algorithm that increases that quantity."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "And also once we had the definition of differential privacy, it was fast to get the algorithms that guaranteed it."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "So you could imagine once we have definitions of good concepts and interpretability, we might be able to provide the algorithms that have the interpretability guarantees quickly too."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So what do you think it takes to build a system with human level intelligence as we quickly venture into the philosophical?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So artificial general intelligence, what do you think it takes?"}, {"time": 3655, "text": "I think that it definitely takes better environments than we currently have for training agents that we want them to have a really wide diversity of experiences."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "I also think it's gonna take really a lot of computation."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "It's hard to imagine exactly how much."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So you're optimistic about simulation, simulating a variety of environments as the path forward?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "I think it's a necessary ingredient."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "Yeah, I don't think that we're going to get to artificial general intelligence by training on fixed data sets or by thinking really hard about the problem."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "I think that the agent really needs to interact and have a variety of experiences within the same lifespan."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And today we have many different models that can each do one thing."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And we tend to train them on one data set or one RL environment."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Sometimes there are actually papers about getting one set of parameters to perform well in many different RL environments."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "But we don't really have anything like an agent that goes seamlessly from one type of experience to another and really integrates all the different things that it does over the course of its life."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "When we do see multi agent environments, they tend to be, or

all our research out there."}, {"time": 349, "text": "If you wanted to, we were building on others research and we wanted to push the state of the art forward."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And part of that was to share the research."}, {"time": 356, "text": "That's how I think deep learning and machine learning has really grown so fast."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So the next step was, okay, now, would software help with that?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "And it seemed like they were existing a few libraries out there, Tiano being one, Torch being another, and a few others, but they were all done by academia and so the level was significantly different."}, {"time": 378, "text": "The other one was from a software perspective, Google had done lots of software or that we used internally, you know, and we published papers."}, {"time": 389, "text": "Often there was an open source project that came out of that that somebody else picked up that paper and implemented and they were very successful."}, {"time": 398, "text": "Back then it was like, okay, there's Hadoop, which has come off of tech that we've built."}, {"time": 404, "text": "We know the tech we've built is way better for a number of different reasons."}, {"time": 407, "text": "We've invested a lot of effort in that."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And turns out we have Google Cloud and we are now not really providing our

about to come out roughly around that time."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So the design sort of included those."}, {"time": 558, "text": "We had started to push on mobile."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So we were running models on mobile."}, {"time": 564, "text": "At that point, people were customizing code."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So we wanted to make sure TensorFlow could support that as well."},

the phone."}, {"time": 589, "text": "We already had a couple of products that were doing that by then."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And in those cases, we had basically customized handcrafted code or

libraries?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "I think we looked at a number of things."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Might even have looked at JNR back then."}, {"time": 666, "text": "I'm trying to remember if it was there."}, {"time": 669, "text": "In fact, yeah, we did discuss ideas around, okay, should we have a graph or not?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "So putting all these together was definitely, they were key decisions that we wanted."}, {"time": 682, "text": "We had seen limitations in our prior disbelief things."}, {"time": 688, "text": "A few of them were just in terms of research was moving so fast, we wanted the flexibility."}, {"time": 695, "text": "The hardware was changing fast."}, {"time": 696, "text": "We expected to change that so that those probably were two things."}, {"time": 699, "text": "And yeah, I think the flexibility in terms of being able to express all kinds of crazy things was definitely a big one then."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So what, the graph decisions though, with moving towards TensorFlow 2.0, there's more, by default, there'll be eager execution."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So sort of hiding the graph a little bit because it's less intuitive in terms of the way people develop and so on."}, {"time": 723, "text": "What was that discussion like in terms of using graphs?"}, {"time": 726, "text": "It seemed, it's kind of the Theano way."}, {"time": 729, "text": "Did it seem the obvious choice?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "So I think where it came from was our disbelief had a graph like thing as well."}, {"time": 737, "text": "A much more simple, it wasn't a general graph, it was more like a straight line thing."}, {"time": 743, "text": "More like what you might think of cafe, I guess in that sense."}, {"time": 746, "text": "But the graph was, and we always cared about the production stuff."}, {"time": 751, "text": "Like even with disbelief, we were deploying a whole bunch of stuff in production."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So graph did come from that when we thought of, okay, should we do that in Python?"}, {"time": 759, "text": "And we experimented with some ideas where it looked a lot simpler to use, but not having a graph meant, okay, how do you deploy now?"}, {"time": 767, "text": "So that was probably what tilted the balance for us and eventually we ended up with a graph."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And I guess the question there is, did you, I mean, so production seems to be the really good thing to focus on, but did you even anticipate the other side of it where there could be, what is it?"}, {"time": 784, "text": "What are the numbers?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "It's been crazy, 41 million downloads."}, {"time": 792, "text": "I mean, was that even like a possibility in your mind that it would be as popular as it became?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "So I think we did see a need for this a lot from the research perspective and like early days of deep learning in some ways."}, {"time": 812, "text": "41 million, no, I don't think I imagined this number."}, {"time": 815, "text": "Then it seemed like there's a potential future where lots more people would be doing this and how do we enable that?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "I would say this kind of growth, I probably started seeing somewhat after the open sourcing where it was like, okay, deep learning is actually growing way faster for a lot of different reasons."}, {"time": 839, "text": "And we are in just the right place to push on that and leverage that and deliver on lots of things that people want."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So what changed once you open sourced?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "Like how this incredible amount of attention from a global population of developers, how did the project start changing?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "I don't even actually remember during those times."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I know looking now, there's really good documentation, there's an ecosystem of tools, there's a community, there's a blog, there's a YouTube channel now, right?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "It's very community driven."}, {"time": 873, "text": "Back then, I guess 0.1 version, is that the version?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "I think we call it 0.6 or five, something like that, I forget."}, {"time": 883, "text": "What changed leading into 1.0?"}, {"time": 888, "text": "I think we've gone through a few things there."}, {"time": 891, "text": "When we started out, when we first came out, people loved the documentation we have because it was just a huge step up from everything else because all of those were academic projects, people doing, who don't think about documentation."}, {"time": 904, "text": "I think what that changed was, instead of deep learning being a research thing, some people who were just developers could now suddenly take this out and do some interesting things with it, right?"}, {"time": 916, "text": "Who had no clue what machine learning was before then."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And that I think really changed how things started to scale up in some ways and pushed on it."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Over the next few months as we looked at how do we stabilize things, as we look at not just researchers, now we want stability, people want to deploy things."}, {"time": 936, "text": "That's how we started planning for 1.0 and there are certain needs for that perspective."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And so again, documentation comes up, designs, more kinds of things to put that together."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And so that was exciting to get that to a stage where more and more enterprises wanted to buy in and really get behind that."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And I think post 1.0 and over the next few releases, that enterprise adoption also started to take off."}, {"time": 964, "text": "I would say between the initial release and 1.0, it was, okay, researchers of course, then a lot of hobbies and early interest, people excited about this who started to get on board and then over the 1.x thing, lots of enterprises."}, {"time": 978, "text": "I imagine anything that's below 1.0 gives pressure to be, the enterprise probably wants something that's stable."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And do you have a sense now that TensorFlow is stable?"}, {"time": 993, "text": "Like it feels like deep learning in general is extremely dynamic field, so much is changing."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And TensorFlow has been growing incredibly."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Do you have a sense of stability at the helm of it?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "I mean, I know you're in the midst of it, but."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Yeah, I think in the midst of it, it's often easy to forget what an enterprise wants and what some of the people on that side want."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "There are still people running models that are three years old, four years old."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So Inception is still used by tons of people."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Even ResNet 50 is what, couple of years old now or more, but there are tons of people who use that and they're fine."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "They don't need the last couple of bits of performance or quality, they want some stability in things that just work."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And so there is value in providing that with that kind of stability and making it really simpler because that allows a lot more people to access it."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And then there's the research crowd which wants, okay, they wanna do these crazy things exactly like you're saying, right?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Not just deep learning in the straight up models that used to be there, they want RNNs and even RNNs are maybe old, they are transformers now."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And now it needs to combine with RL and GANs and so on."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So there's definitely that area that like the boundary that's shifting and pushing the state of the art."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "But I think there's more and more of the past that's much more stable and even stuff that was two, three years old is very, very usable by lots of people."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So that part makes it a lot easier."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So I imagine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, one of the biggest use cases is essentially taking something like ResNet 50 and doing some kind of transfer learning on a very particular problem that you have."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "It's basically probably what majority of the world does."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And you wanna make that as easy as possible."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So I would say for the hobbyist perspective, that's the most common case, right?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "In fact, the apps and phones and stuff that you'll see, the early ones, that's the most common case."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "I would say there are a couple of reasons for that."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "One is that everybody talks about that."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "It looks great on slides."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "That's a presentation, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "What enterprises want is that is part of it, but that's not the big thing."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "Enterprises really have data that they wanna make predictions on."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "This is often what they used to do with the people who were doing ML was just regression models, linear regression, logistic regression, linear models, or maybe gradient booster trees and so on."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Some of them still benefit from deep learning, but they want that's the bread and butter, or like the structured data and so on."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So depending on the audience you look at, they're a little bit different."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "And they just have, I mean, the best of enterprise probably just has a very large data set, or deep learning can probably shine."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "That's correct, that's right."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And then I think the other pieces that they wanted, again, with 2.0, the developer summit we put together is the whole TensorFlow Extended piece, which is the entire pipeline."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "They care about stability across doing their entire thing."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "They want simplicity across the entire thing."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I don't need to just train a model."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I need to do that every day again, over and over again."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "I wonder to which degree you have a role in, I don't know, so I teach a course on deep learning."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "I have people like lawyers come up to me and say, when is machine learning gonna enter legal, the legal realm?"}, {"time": 1205, "text": "The same thing in all kinds of disciplines, immigration, insurance, often when I see what it boils down to is these companies are often a little bit old school in the way they organize the data."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So the data is just not ready yet, it's not digitized."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Do you also find yourself being in the role of an evangelist for like, let's get, organize your data, folks, and then you'll get the big benefit of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Do you get those, have those conversations?"}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Yeah, yeah, you know, I get all kinds of questions there from, okay, what do I need to make this work, right?"}, {"time": 1249, "text": "Do we really need deep learning?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "I mean, there are all these things, I already use this linear model, why would this help?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "I don't have enough data, let's say, or I wanna use machine learning, but I have no clue where to start."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So it varies, that to all the way to the experts to why support very specific things, it's interesting."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Is there a good answer?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "It boils down to oftentimes digitizing data."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So whatever you want automated, whatever data you want to make prediction based on, you have to make sure that it's in an organized form."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Like within the TensorFlow ecosystem, there's now, you're providing more and more data sets and more and more pre trained models."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Are you finding yourself also the organizer of data sets?"}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Yes, I think the TensorFlow data sets that we just released, that's definitely come up where people want these data sets, can we organize them and can we make that easier?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So that's definitely one important thing."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "The other related thing I would say is I often tell people, you know what, don't think of the most fanciest thing that the newest model that you see, make something very basic work and then you can improve it."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "There's just lots of things you can do with it."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Yeah, start with the basics, true."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "One of the big things that makes TensorFlow even more accessible was the appearance whenever that happened of Keras, the Keras standard sort of outside of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I think it was Keras on top of Tiano at first only and then Keras became on top of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Do you know when Keras chose to also add TensorFlow as a backend, who was the, was it just the community that drove that initially?"},

Tiano."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I don't remember if that was after TensorFlow was created or way before."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And then at some point, when TensorFlow started becoming popular, there were enough similarities that he decided to create this interface and put TensorFlow as a backend."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "I believe that might still have been before he joined Google."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So we weren't really talking about that."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "He decided on his own and thought that was interesting and relevant to the community."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "In fact, I didn't find out about him being at Google until a few months after he was here."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "He was working on some research ideas and doing Keras on his nights and weekends project."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "He wasn't like part of the TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "He didn't join initially."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "He joined research and he was doing some amazing research."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "He has some papers on that and research, so he's a great researcher as well."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And at some point we realized, oh, he's doing this good stuff."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "People seem to like the API and he's right here."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So we talked to him and he said, okay, why don't I come over to your team and work with you for a quarter and let's make that integration happen."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And we talked to his manager and he said, sure, quarter's fine."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And that quarter's been something like two years now."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And so he's fully on this."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So Keras got integrated into TensorFlow in a deep way."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And now with 2.0, TensorFlow 2.0, sort of Keras is kind of the recommended way for a beginner to interact with TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Which makes that initial sort of transfer learning or the basic use cases, even for an enterprise, super simple, right?"}, {"time": 1472, "text": "That seems like it's kind of a bold decision as well."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "We did spend a lot of time thinking about that one."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "We had a bunch of APIs, some built by us."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "There was a parallel layers API that we were building."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And when we decided to do Keras in parallel, so there were like, okay, two things that we are looking at."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And the first thing we was trying to do is just have them look similar, like be as integrated as possible, share all of that stuff."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "There were also like three other APIs that others had built over time because we didn't have a standard one."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "But one of the messages that we kept hearing from the community, okay, which one do we use?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And they kept seeing like, okay, here's a model in this one and here's a model in this one, which should I pick?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So that's sort of like, okay, we had to address that straight on with 2.0."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "The whole idea was we need to simplify."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "We had to pick one."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Based on where we were, we were like, okay, let's see what are the people like?"}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And Keras was clearly one that lots of people loved."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "There were lots of great things about it."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So we settled on that."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Organically, that's kind of the best way to do it."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "It was great."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "It was surprising, nevertheless, to sort of bring in an outside."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "I mean, there was a feeling like Keras might be almost like a competitor in a certain kind of, to TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And in a sense, it became an empowering element of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting how you can put two things together, which can align."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "In this case, I think Francois, the team, and a bunch of us have chatted, and I think we all want to see the same kind of things."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "We all care about making it easier for the huge set of developers out there, and that makes a difference."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So Python has Guido van Rossum, who until recently held the position of benevolent dictator for life."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "All right, so there's a huge successful open source project like TensorFlow need one person who makes a final decision."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So you've did a pretty successful TensorFlow Dev Summit just now, last couple of days."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "There's clearly a lot of different new features being incorporated, an amazing ecosystem, so on."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Who's, how are those design decisions made?"}, {"time": 1617, "text": "Is there a BDFL in TensorFlow, or is it more distributed and organic?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "I think it's somewhat different, I would say."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "I've always been involved in the key design directions, but there are lots of things that are distributed where there are a number of people, Martin Wick being one, who has really driven a lot of our open source stuff, a lot of the APIs, and there are a number of other people who've been, you know, pushed and been responsible for different parts of it."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "We do have regular design reviews."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Over the last year, we've had a lot of we've really spent a lot of time opening up to the community and adding transparency."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "We're setting more processes in place, so RFCs, special interest groups, to really grow that community and scale that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I think the kind of scale that ecosystem is in, I don't think we could scale with having me as the lone point of decision maker."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "So, yeah, the growth of that ecosystem, maybe you can talk about it a little bit."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "First of all, it started with Andrej Karpathy when he first did ComNetJS."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "The fact that you can train and you'll network in the browser was, in JavaScript, was incredible."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So now TensorFlow.js is really making that a serious, like a legit thing, a way to operate, whether it's in the backend or the front end."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Then there's the TensorFlow Extended, like you mentioned."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "There's TensorFlow Lite for mobile."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And all of it, as far as I can tell, it's really converging towards being able to save models in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "You can move around, you can train on the desktop and then move it to mobile and so on."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "So there's that cohesiveness."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So can you maybe give me, whatever I missed, a bigger overview of the mission of the ecosystem that's trying to be built and where is it moving forward?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in short, the way I like to think of this is our goals to enable machine learning."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "And in a couple of ways, you know, one is we have lots of exciting things going on in ML today."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "We started with deep learning, but we now support a bunch of other algorithms too."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "So one is to, on the research side, keep pushing on the state of the art."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Can we, you know, how do we enable researchers to build the next amazing thing?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So BERT came out recently, you know, it's great that people are able to do new kinds of research."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And there are lots of amazing research that happens across the world."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So that's one direction."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "The other is how do you take that across all the people outside who want to take that research and do some great things with it and integrate it to build real products, to have a real impact on people."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And so if that's the other axes in some ways, you know, at a high level, one way I think about it is there are a crazy number of compute devices across the world."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "And we often used to think of ML and training and all of this as, okay, something you do either in the workstation or the data center or cloud."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "But we see things running on the phones."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "We see things running on really tiny chips."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "I mean, we had some demos at the developer summit."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "And so the way I think about this ecosystem is how do we help get machine learning on every device that has a compute capability?"}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And that continues to grow and so in some ways this ecosystem is looked at, you know, various aspects of that and grown over time to cover more of those."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "And we continue to push the boundaries."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "In some areas we've built more tooling and things around that to help you."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "I mean, the first tool we started was TensorBoard."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "You wanted to learn just the training piece, the effects or TensorFlow extended to really do your entire ML pipelines."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "If you're, you know, care about all that production stuff, but then going to the edge, going to different kinds of things."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "And it's not just us now."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "We are a place where there are lots of libraries being built on top."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So there are some for research, maybe things like TensorFlow agents or TensorFlow probability that started as research things or for researchers for focusing on certain kinds of algorithms, but they're also being deployed or used by, you know, production folks."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "And some have come from within Google, just teams across Google who wanted to build these things."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Others have come from just the community because there are different pieces that different parts of the community care about."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And I see our goal as enabling even that, right?"}, {"time": 1909, "text": "It's not, we cannot and won't build every single thing."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "That just doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "But if we can enable others to build the things that they care about, and there's a broader community that cares about that, and we can help encourage that, and that's great."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "That really helps the entire ecosystem, not just those."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "One of the big things about 2.0 that we're pushing on is, okay, we have these so many different pieces, right?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "How do we help make all of them work well together?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So there are a few key pieces there that we're pushing on, one being the core format in there and how we share the models themselves through save model and TensorFlow hub and so on."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And a few of the pieces that we really put this together."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I was very skeptical that that's, you know, when TensorFlow.js came out, it didn't seem, or deep learning JS as it was earlier."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Yeah, that was the first."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "It seems like technically very difficult project."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "As a standalone, it's not as difficult, but as a thing that integrates into the ecosystem, it seems very difficult."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So, I mean, there's a lot of aspects of this you're making look easy, but, and the technical side, how many challenges have to be overcome here?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And still have to be overcome."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "That's the question here too."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "There are lots of steps to it, right?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And we've iterated over the last few years, so there's a lot we've learned."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I, yeah, and often when things come together well, things look easy and that's exactly the point."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "It should be easy for the end user, but there are lots of things that go behind that."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "If I think about still challenges ahead, there are, you know, we have a lot more devices coming on board, for example, from the hardware perspective."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "How do we make it really easy for these vendors to integrate with something like TensorFlow, right?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "So there's a lot of compiler stuff that others are working on."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "There are things we can do in terms of our APIs and so on that we can do."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "As we, you know, TensorFlow started as a very monolithic system and to some extent it still is."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "There are less, lots of tools around it, but the core is still pretty large and monolithic."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "One of the key challenges for us to scale that out is how do we break that apart with clearer interfaces?"}, {"time": 2050, "text": "It's, you know, in some ways it's software engineering 101, but for a system that's now four years old, I guess, or more, and that's still rapidly evolving and that we're not slowing down with, it's hard to change and modify and really break apart."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "It's sort of like, as people say, right, it's like changing the engine with a car running or trying to fix that."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "That's exactly what we're trying to do."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So there's a challenge here because the downside of so many people being excited about TensorFlow and coming to rely on it in many of their applications is that you're kind of responsible, like it's the technical debt."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "You're responsible for previous versions to some degree still working."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "So when you're trying to innovate, I mean, it's probably easier to just start from scratch every few months."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "So do you feel the pain of that?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "2.0 does break some back compatibility, but not too much."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "It seems like the conversion is pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "Do you think that's still important given how quickly deep learning is changing?"}, {"time": 2122, "text": "Can you just, the things that you've learned, can you just start over or is there pressure to not?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "It's a tricky balance."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So if it was just a researcher writing a paper who a year later will not look at that code again, sure, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "There are a lot of production systems that rely on TensorFlow, both at Google and across the world."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And people worry about this."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "I mean, these systems run for a long time."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So it is important to keep that compatibility and so on."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "And yes, it does come with a huge cost."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "There's, we have to think about a lot of things as we do new things and make new changes."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "I think it's a trade off, right?"}, {"time": 2169, "text": "You can, you might slow certain kinds of things down, but the overall value you're bringing because of that is much bigger because it's not just about breaking the person yesterday."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "It's also about telling the person tomorrow that, you know what, this is how we do things."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "We're not gonna break you when you come on board because there are lots of new people who are also gonna come on board."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And, you know, one way I like to think about this, and I always push the team to think about it as well, when you wanna do new things, you wanna start with a clean slate."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Design with a clean slate in mind, and then we'll figure out how to make sure all the other things work."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And yes, we do make compromises occasionally, but unless you design with the clean slate and not worry about that, you'll never get to a good place."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Oh, that's brilliant, so even if you are responsible when you're in the idea stage, when you're thinking of new, just put all that behind you."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Okay, that's really, really well put."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So I have to ask this because a lot of students, developers ask me how I feel about PyTorch versus TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So I've recently completely switched my research group to TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "I wish everybody would just use the same thing, and TensorFlow is as close to that, I believe, as we have."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But do you enjoy competition?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So TensorFlow is leading in many ways, on many dimensions in terms of ecosystem, in terms of number of users, momentum, power, production levels, so on, but a lot of researchers are now also using PyTorch."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "Do you enjoy that kind of competition or do you just ignore it and focus on making TensorFlow the best that it can be?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So just like research or anything people are doing, it's great to get different kinds of ideas."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And when we started with TensorFlow, like I was saying earlier, one, it was very important for us to also have production in mind."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "We didn't want just research, right?"}, {"time": 2289, "text": "And that's why we chose certain things."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "Now PyTorch came along and said, you know what, I only care about research."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "This is what I'm trying to do."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "What's the best thing I can do for this?"}, {"time": 2298, "text": "And it started iterating and said, okay, I don't need to worry about graphs."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "Let me just run things."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And I don't care if it's not as fast as it can be, but let me just make this part easy."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "And there are things you can learn from that, right?"}, {"time": 2312, "text": "They, again, had the benefit of seeing what had come before, but also exploring certain different kinds of spaces."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "And they had some good things there, building on say things like JNR and so on before that."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So competition is definitely interesting."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "It made us, you know, this is an area that we had thought about, like I said, way early on."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "Over time we had revisited this a couple of times, should we add this again?"}, {"time": 2339, "text": "At some point we said, you know what, it seems like this can be done well, so let's try it again."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And that's how we started pushing on eager execution."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "How do we combine those two together?"}, {"time": 2349, "text": "Which has finally come very well together in 2.0, but it took us a while to get all the things together and so on."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So let me ask, put another way, I think eager execution is a really powerful thing that was added."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Do you think it wouldn't have been, you know, Muhammad Ali versus Frasier, right?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "Do you think it wouldn't have been added as quickly if PyTorch wasn't there?"}, {"time": 2373, "text": "It might have taken longer."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "No longer?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "Yeah, it was, I mean, we had tried some variants of that before, so I'm sure it would have happened, but it might have taken longer."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "I'm grateful that TensorFlow is finally in the way they did."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "It's doing some incredible work last couple years."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "What other things that we didn't talk about are you looking forward in 2.0?"}, {"time": 2391, "text": "That comes to mind."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "So we talked about some of the ecosystem stuff, making it easily accessible to Keras, eager execution."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Is there other things that we missed?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Yeah, so I would say one is just where 2.0 is, and you know, with all the things that we've talked about, I think as we think beyond that, there are lots of other things that it enables us to do and that we're excited about."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So what it's setting us up for, okay, here are these really clean APIs."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "We've cleaned up the surface for what the users want."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "What it also allows us to do a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes once we are ready with 2.0."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "So for example, in TensorFlow with graphs and all the things you could do, you could always get a lot of good performance if you spent the time to tune it, right?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "And we've clearly shown that, lots of people do that."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "With 2.0, with these APIs, where we are, we can give you a lot of performance just with whatever you do."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "You know, because we see these, it's much cleaner."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "We know most people are gonna do things this way."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "We can really optimize for that and get a lot of those things out of the box."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "And it really allows us, you know, both for single machine and distributed and so on, to really explore other spaces behind the scenes after 2.0 in the future versions as well."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "So right now the team's really excited about that, that over time I think we'll see that."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "The other piece that I was talking about in terms of just restructuring the monolithic thing into more pieces and making it more modular, I think that's gonna be really important for a lot of the other people in the ecosystem, other organizations and so on that wanted to build things."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "Can you elaborate a little bit what you mean by making TensorFlow ecosystem more modular?"}, {"time": 2510, "text": "So the way it's organized today is there's one, there are lots of repositories in the TensorFlow organization at GitHub."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "The core one where we have TensorFlow, it has the execution engine, it has the key backends for CPUs and GPUs, it has the work to do distributed stuff."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And all of these just work together in a single library or binary."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "There's no way to split them apart easily."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "I mean, there are some interfaces, but they're not very clean."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "In a perfect world, you would have clean interfaces where, okay, I wanna run it on my fancy cluster with some custom networking, just implement this and do that."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "I mean, we kind of support that, but it's hard for people today."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "I think as we are starting to see more interesting things in some of these spaces, having that clean separation will really start to help."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And again, going to the large size of the ecosystem and the different groups involved there, enabling people to evolve and push on things more independently just allows it to scale better."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And by people, you mean individual developers and?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So the hope is that everybody sort of major, I don't know, Pepsi or something uses, like major corporations go to TensorFlow to this kind of."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Yeah, if you look at enterprises like Pepsi or these, I mean, a lot of them are already using TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "They are not the ones that do the development or changes in the core."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "Some of them do, but a lot of them don't."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "I mean, they touch small pieces."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "There are lots of these, some of them being, let's say, hardware vendors who are building their custom hardware and they want their own pieces."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "Or some of them being bigger companies, say, IBM."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I mean, they're involved in some of our special interest groups, and they see a lot of users who want certain things and they want to optimize for that."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "So folks like that often."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Autonomous vehicle companies, perhaps."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "So, yeah, like I mentioned, TensorFlow has been downloaded 41 million times, 50,000 commits, almost 10,000 pull requests, and 1,800 contributors."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "So I'm not sure if you can explain it, but what does it take to build a community like that?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "In retrospect, what do you think, what is the critical thing that allowed for this growth to happen, and how does that growth continue?"}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Yeah, yeah, that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "I wish I had all the answers there, I guess, so you could replicate it."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "I think there are a number of things that need to come together, right?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "One, just like any new thing, it is about, there's a sweet spot of timing, what's needed, does it grow with, what's needed, so in this case, for example, TensorFlow's not just grown because it was a good tool, it's also grown with the growth of deep learning itself."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "So those factors come into play."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "Other than that, though, I think just hearing, listening to the community, what they do, what they need, being open to, like in terms of external contributions, we've spent a lot of time in making sure we can accept those contributions well, we can help the contributors in adding those, putting the right process in place, getting the right kind of community, welcoming them and so on."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Like over the last year, we've really pushed on transparency, that's important for an open source project."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "People wanna know where things are going, and we're like, okay, here's a process where you can do that, here are our RFCs and so on."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So thinking through, there are lots of community aspects that come into that you can really work on."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "As a small project, it's maybe easy to do because there's like two developers and you can do those."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "As you grow, putting more of these processes in place, thinking about the documentation, thinking about what two developers care about, what kind of tools would they want to use, all of these come into play, I think."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "So one of the big things I think that feeds the TensorFlow fire is people building something on TensorFlow, and implement a particular architecture that does something cool and useful, and they put that on GitHub."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And so it just feeds this growth."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "Do you have a sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there may be a little bit of a partitioning like there is with Python 2 and 3, that there'll be a code base and in the older versions of TensorFlow, they will not be as compatible easily?"}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Or are you pretty confident that this kind of conversion is pretty natural and easy to do?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So we're definitely working hard to make that very easy to do."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "There's lots of tooling that we talked about at the developer summit this week, and we'll continue to invest in that tooling."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "It's, you know, when you think of these significant version changes, that's always a risk, and we are really pushing hard to make that transition very, very smooth."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So I think, so at some level, people wanna move and they see the value in the new thing."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "They don't wanna move just because it's a new thing, and some people do, but most people want a really good thing."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "And I think over the next few months, as people start to see the value, we'll definitely see that shift happening."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So I'm pretty excited and confident that we will see people moving."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "As you said earlier, this field is also moving rapidly, so that'll help because we can do more things and all the new things will clearly happen in 2.x, so people will have lots of good reasons to move."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So what do you think TensorFlow 3.0 looks like?"}, {"time": 2856, "text": "Is there, are things happening so crazily that even at the end of this year seems impossible to plan for?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Or is it possible to plan for the next five years?"}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I think it's tricky."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "There are some things that we can expect in terms of, okay, change, yes, change is gonna happen."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "Are there some things gonna stick around and some things not gonna stick around?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "I would say the basics of deep learning, the, you know, say convolution models or the basic kind of things, they'll probably be around in some form still in five years."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "Will RL and GAN stay?"}, {"time": 2898, "text": "Very likely, based on where they are."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Will we have new things?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Probably, but those are hard to predict."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "And some directionally, some things that we can see is, you know, in things that we're starting to do, right, with some of our projects right now is just 2.0 combining eager execution and graphs where we're starting to make it more like just your natural programming language."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "You're not trying to program something else."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "Similarly, with Swift for TensorFlow, we're taking that approach."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Can you do something ground up, right?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "So some of those ideas seem like, okay, that's the right direction."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "In five years, we expect to see more in that area."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Other things we don't know is, will hardware accelerators be the same?"}, {"time": 2943, "text": "Will we be able to train with four bits instead of 32 bits?"}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And I think the TPU side of things is exploring that."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "I mean, TPU is already on version three."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "It seems that the evolution of TPU and TensorFlow are sort of, they're coevolving almost in terms of both are learning from each other and from the community and from the applications where the biggest benefit is achieved."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "You've been trying to sort of, with Eager, with Keras, to make TensorFlow as accessible and easy to use as possible."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "What do you think, for beginners, is the biggest thing they struggle with?"}, {"time": 2980, "text": "Have you encountered that?"}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Or is basically what Keras is solving is that Eager, like we talked about?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Yeah, for some of them, like you said, right, the beginners want to just be able to take some image model, they don't care if it's Inception or ResNet or something else, and do some training or transfer learning on their kind of model."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "Being able to make that easy is important."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So in some ways, if you do that by providing them simple models with say, in hub or so on, they don't care about what's inside that box, but they want to be able to use it."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So we're pushing on, I think, different levels."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "If you look at just a component that you get, which has the layers already smooshed in, the beginners probably just want that."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Then the next step is, okay, look at building layers with Keras."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "If you go out to research, then they are probably writing custom layers themselves or doing their own loops."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So there's a whole spectrum there."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "And then providing the pre trained models seems to really decrease the time from you trying to start."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "You could basically in a Colab notebook achieve what you need."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So I'm basically answering my own question because I think what TensorFlow delivered on recently is trivial for beginners."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So I was just wondering if there was other pain points you're trying to ease, but I'm not sure there would."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "No, those are probably the big ones."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "I see high schoolers doing a whole bunch of things now, which is pretty amazing."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "It's both amazing and terrifying."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "In a sense that when they grow up, it's some incredible ideas will be coming from them."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "So there's certainly a technical aspect to your work, but you also have a management aspect to your role with TensorFlow leading the project, a large number of developers and people."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "So what do you look for in a good team?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "What do you think?"}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Google has been at the forefront of exploring what it takes to build a good team and TensorFlow is one of the most cutting edge technologies in the world."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So in this context, what do you think makes for a good team?"}, {"time": 3110, "text": "It's definitely something I think a favorite about."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "I think in terms of the team being able to deliver something well, one of the things that's important is a cohesion across the team."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "So being able to execute together in doing things that's not an end, like at this scale, an individual engineer can only do so much."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "There's a lot more that they can do together, even though we have some amazing superstars across Google and in the team, but there's, you know, often the way I see it as the product of what the team generates is way larger than the whole or the individual put together."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And so how do we have all of them work together, the culture of the team itself, hiring good people is important."}, {"time": 3163, "text": "But part of that is it's not just that, okay, we hire a bunch of smart people and throw them together and let them do things."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "It's also people have to care about what they're building, people have to be motivated for the right kind of things."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "That's often an important factor."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "And, you know, finally, how do you put that together with a somewhat unified vision of where we wanna go?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So are we all looking in the same direction or each of us going all over?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "And sometimes it's a mix."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "Google's a very bottom up organization in some sense, also research even more so, and that's how we started."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "But as we've become this larger product and ecosystem, I think it's also important to combine that well with a mix of, okay, here's the direction we wanna go in."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "There is exploration we'll do around that, but let's keep staying in that direction, not just all over the place."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And is there a way you monitor the health of the team?"}, {"time": 3226, "text": "Sort of like, is there a way you know you did a good job?"}, {"time": 3231, "text": "The team is good?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "Like, I mean, you're sort of, you're saying nice things, but it's sometimes difficult to determine how aligned."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Because it's not binary."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "It's not like there's tensions and complexities and so on."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And the other element of the mission of superstars, there's so much, even at Google, such a large percentage of work is done by individual superstars too."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So there's a, and sometimes those superstars can be against the dynamic of a team and those tensions."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "I mean, I'm sure in TensorFlow it might be a little bit easier because the mission of the project is so sort of beautiful."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "You're at the cutting edge, so it's exciting."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "But have you had struggle with that?"}, {"time": 3276, "text": "Has there been challenges?"}, {"time": 3278, "text": "There are always people challenges in different kinds of ways."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "That said, I think we've been what's good about getting people who care and are, you know, have the same kind of culture, and that's Google in general to a large extent."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "But also, like you said, given that the project has had so many exciting things to do, there's been room for lots of people to do different kinds of things and grow, which does make the problem a bit easier, I guess."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "And it allows people, depending on what they're doing, if there's room around them, then that's fine."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "But yes, we do care about whether a superstar or not, that they need to work well with the team across Google."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "That's interesting to hear."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "So it's like superstar or not, the productivity broadly is about the team."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "I mean, they might add a lot of value, but if they're hurting the team, then that's a problem."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "So in hiring engineers, it's so interesting, right, the hiring process."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "What do you look for?"}, {"time": 3341, "text": "How do you determine a good developer or a good member of a team from just a few minutes or hours together?"}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Again, no magic answers, I'm sure."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Yeah, I mean, Google has a hiring process that we've refined over the last 20 years, I guess, and that you've probably heard and seen a lot about."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So we do work with the same hiring process and that's really helped."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "For me in particular, I would say, in addition to the core technical skills, what does matter is their motivation in what they wanna do."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "Because if that doesn't align well with where we wanna go, that's not gonna lead to long term success for either them or the team."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And I think that becomes more important the more senior the person is, but it's important at every level."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "Like even the junior most engineer, if they're not motivated to do well at what they're trying to do, however smart they are, it's gonna be hard for them to succeed."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "Does the Google hiring process touch on that passion?"}, {"time": 3404, "text": "So like trying to determine, because I think as far as I understand, maybe you can speak to it, that the Google hiring process sort of helps in the initial like determines the skill set there, is your puzzle solving ability, problem solving ability good?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "But like, I'm not sure, but it seems that the determining whether the person is like fire inside them, that burns to do anything really, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "It's just some cool stuff, I'm gonna do it."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "Is that something that ultimately ends up when they have a conversation with you or once it gets closer to the team?"}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So one of the things we do have as part of the process is just a culture fit, like part of the interview process itself, in addition to just the technical skills and each engineer or whoever the interviewer is, is supposed to rate the person on the culture and the culture fit with Google and so on."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "So that is definitely part of the process."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Now, there are various kinds of projects and different kinds of things."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "So there might be variants and of the kind of culture you want there and so on."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "And yes, that does vary."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "So for example, TensorFlow has always been a fast moving project and we want people who are comfortable with that."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "But at the same time now, for example, we are at a place where we are also very full fledged product and we wanna make sure things that work really, really work, right?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "You can't cut corners all the time."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "So balancing that out and finding the people who are the right fit for those is important."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And I think those kinds of things do vary a bit across projects and teams and product areas across Google."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "And so you'll see some differences there in the final checklist."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "But a lot of the core culture, it comes along with just the engineering excellence and so on."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "What is the hardest part of your job?"}, {"time": 3519, "text": "I'll take your pick, I guess."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "It's fun, I would say, right?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Hard, yes."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "I mean, lots of things at different times."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "I think that does vary."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So let me clarify that difficult things are fun when you solve them, right?"}, {"time": 3533, "text": "So it's fun in that sense."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "I think the key to a successful thing across the board and in this case, it's a large ecosystem now, but even a small product, is striking that fine balance across different aspects of it."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "Sometimes it's how fast do you go versus how perfect it is."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "Sometimes it's how do you involve this huge community?"}, {"time": 3561, "text": "Who do you involve or do you decide, okay, now is not a good time to involve them because it's not the right fit."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Sometimes it's saying no to certain kinds of things."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "Those are often the hard decisions."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "Some of them you make quickly because you don't have the time."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "Some of them you get time to think about them, but they're always hard."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So both choices are pretty good, those decisions."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "What about deadlines?"}, {"time": 3590, "text": "Is this, do you find TensorFlow, to be driven by deadlines to a degree that a product might?"}, {"time": 3600, "text": "Or is there still a balance to where it's less deadline?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "You had the Dev Summit today that came together incredibly."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "Looked like there's a lot of moving pieces and so on."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So did that deadline make people rise to the occasion releasing TensorFlow 2.0 alpha?"}, {"time": 3618, "text": "I'm sure that was done last minute as well."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "I mean, up to the last point."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Again, it's one of those things that you need to strike the good balance."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "There's some value that deadlines bring that does bring a sense of urgency to get the right things together."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Instead of getting the perfect thing out, you need something that's good and works well."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "And the team definitely did a great job in putting that together."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So I was very amazed and excited by everything how that came together."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "That said, across the year, we try not to put out official deadlines."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "We focus on key things that are important, figure out how much of it's important."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "And we are developing in the open, both internally and externally, everything's available to everybody."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So you can pick and look at where things are."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "We do releases at a regular cadence."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So fine, if something doesn't necessarily end up this month, it'll end up in the next release in a month or two."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And that's okay, but we want to keep moving as fast as we can in these different areas."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "Because we can iterate and improve on things, sometimes it's okay to put things out that aren't fully ready."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "We'll make sure it's clear that okay, this is experimental, but it's out there if you want to try and give feedback."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "That's very, very useful."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "I think that quick cycle and quick iteration is important."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "That's what we often focus on rather than here's a deadline where you get everything else."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "Is 2.0, is there pressure to make that stable?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "Or like, for example, WordPress 5.0 just came out and there was no pressure to, it was a lot of build updates delivered way too late, but, and they said, okay, well, but we're gonna release a lot of updates really quickly to improve it."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "Do you see TensorFlow 2.0 in that same kind of way or is there this pressure to once it hits 2.0, once you get to the release candidate and then you get to the final, that's gonna be the stable thing?"}, {"time": 3742, "text": "So it's gonna be stable in, just like when NodeX was where every API that's there is gonna remain in work."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "It doesn't mean we can't change things under the covers."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "It doesn't mean we can't add things."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "So there's still a lot more for us to do and we'll continue to have more releases."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So in that sense, there's still, I don't think we'll be done in like two months when we release this."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "I don't know if you can say, but is there, there's not external deadlines for TensorFlow 2.0, but is there internal deadlines, the artificial or otherwise, that you're trying to set for yourself or is it whenever it's ready?"}, {"time": 3783, "text": "So we want it to be a great product, right?"}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And that's a big important piece for us."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "TensorFlow's already out there."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "We have 41 million downloads for 1.0 X."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "So it's not like we have to have this."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "So it's not like, a lot of the features that we've really polishing and putting them together are there."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "We don't have to rush that just because."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So in that sense, we wanna get it right and really focus on that."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "That said, we have said that we are looking to get this out in the next few months, in the next quarter."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And as far as possible, we'll definitely try to make that happen."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Yeah, my favorite line was, spring is a relative concept."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "I love it."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Spoken like a true developer."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "So something I'm really interested in and your previous line of work is, before TensorFlow, you led a team at Google on search ads."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "I think this is a very interesting topic on every level, on a technical level, because at their best, ads connect people to the things they want and need."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "So, and at their worst, they're just these things that annoy the heck out of you to the point of ruining the entire user experience of whatever you're actually doing."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "So they have a bad rep, I guess."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And on the other end, so that this connecting users to the thing they need and want is a beautiful opportunity for machine learning to shine."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Like huge amounts of data that's personalized and you kind of map to the thing they actually want won't get annoyed."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So what have you learned from this, Google that's leading the world in this aspect, what have you learned from that experience and what do you think is the future of ads?"}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Take you back to that."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Yeah, yes, it's been a while, but I totally agree with what you said."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "I think the search ads, the way it was always looked at and I believe it still is, is it's an extension of what search is trying to do."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "And the goal is to make the information and make the world's information accessible."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "That's it's not just information, but maybe products or other things that people care about."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "And so it's really important for them to align with what the users need."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And in search ads, there's a minimum quality level before that ad would be shown."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "If you don't have an ad that hits that quality, but it will not be shown even if we have it and okay, maybe we lose some money there, that's fine."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "That is really, really important."}, {"time":

"What is your intuition why an intelligence explosion is not possible?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "Like taking the scientific, all the semi scientific revolutions, why can't we slightly accelerate that process?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "So you can absolutely accelerate any problem solving process."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So a recursively self improvement is absolutely a real thing."}, {"time": 948, "text": "But what happens with a recursively self improving system is typically not explosion because no system exists in isolation."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And so tweaking one part of the system means that suddenly another part of the system becomes a bottleneck."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And if you look at science, for instance, which is clearly a recursively self improving, clearly a problem solving system, scientific progress is not actually exploding."}, {"time": 972, "text": "If you look at science, what you see is the picture of a system that is consuming an exponentially increasing amount of resources, but it's having a linear output in terms of scientific progress."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And maybe that will seem like a very strong claim."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Many people are actually saying that, scientific progress is exponential, but when they're claiming this, they're actually looking at indicators of resource consumption by science."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "For instance, the number of papers being published, the number of patents being filed and so on, which are just completely correlated with how many people are working on science today."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So it's actually an indicator of resource consumption, but what you should look at is the output, is progress in terms of the knowledge that science generates, in terms of the scope and significance of the problems that we solve."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And some people have actually been trying to measure that."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Like Michael Nielsen, for instance, he had a very nice paper, I think that was last year about it."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So his approach to measure scientific progress was to look at the timeline of scientific discoveries over the past, you know, 100, 150 years."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And for each major discovery, ask a panel of experts to rate the significance of the discovery."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And if the output of science as an institution were exponential, you would expect the temporal density of significance to go up exponentially."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Maybe because there's a faster rate of discoveries, maybe because the discoveries are, you know, increasingly more important."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And what actually happens if you plot this temporal density of significance measured in this way, is that you see very much a flat graph."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "You see a flat graph across all disciplines, across physics, biology, medicine, and so on."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And it actually makes a lot of sense if you think about it, because think about the progress of physics 110 years ago, right?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "It was a time of crazy change."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Think about the progress of technology, you know, 170 years ago, when we started having, you know, replacing horses with cars, when we started having electricity and so on."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "It was a time of incredible change."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And today is also a time of very, very fast change, but it would be an unfair characterization to say that today technology and science are moving way faster than they did 50 years ago or 100 years ago."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And if you do try to rigorously plot the temporal density of the significance, yeah, of significance, sorry, you do see very flat curves."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And you can check out the paper that Michael Nielsen had about this idea."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And so the way I interpret it is, as you make progress in a given field, or in a given subfield of science, it becomes exponentially more difficult to make further progress."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Like the very first person to work on information theory."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "If you enter a new field, and it's still the very early years, there's a lot of low hanging fruit you can pick."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "But the next generation of researchers is gonna have to dig much harder, actually, to make smaller discoveries, probably larger number of smaller discoveries, and to achieve the same amount of impact, you're gonna need a much greater head count."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "And that's exactly the picture you're seeing with science, that the number of scientists and engineers is in fact increasing exponentially."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "The amount of computational resources that are available to science is increasing exponentially and so on."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So the resource consumption of science is exponential, but the output in terms of progress, in terms of significance, is linear."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And the reason why is because, and even though science is regressively self improving, meaning that scientific progress turns into technological progress, which in turn helps science."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "If you look at computers, for instance, our products of science and computers are tremendously useful in speeding up science."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "The internet, same thing, the internet is a technology that's made possible by very recent scientific advances."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And itself, because it enables scientists to network, to communicate, to exchange papers and ideas much faster, it is a way to speed up scientific progress."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So even though you're looking at a regressively self improving system, it is consuming exponentially more resources to produce the same amount of problem solving, very much."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So that's a fascinating way to paint it, and certainly that holds for the deep learning community."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "If you look at the temporal, what did you call it, the temporal density of significant ideas, if you look at in deep learning, I think, I'd have to think about that, but if you really look at significant ideas in deep learning, they might even be decreasing."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So I do believe the per paper significance is decreasing, but the amount of papers is still today exponentially increasing."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So I think if you look at an aggregate, my guess is that you would see a linear progress."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "If you were to sum the significance of all papers, you would see roughly in your progress."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And in my opinion, it is not a coincidence that you're seeing linear progress in science despite exponential resource consumption."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "I think the resource consumption is dynamically adjusting itself to maintain linear progress because we as a community expect linear progress, meaning that if we start investing less and seeing less progress, it means that suddenly there are some lower hanging fruits that become available and someone's gonna step up and pick them, right?"}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So it's very much like a market for discoveries and ideas."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "But there's another fundamental part which you're highlighting, which as a hypothesis as science or like the space of ideas, any one path you travel down, it gets exponentially more difficult to get a new way to develop new ideas."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And your sense is that's gonna hold across our mysterious universe."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Yes, well, exponential progress triggers exponential friction."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "So that if you tweak one part of the system, suddenly some other part becomes a bottleneck, right?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "For instance, let's say you develop some device that measures its own acceleration and then it has some engine and it outputs even more acceleration in proportion of its own acceleration and you drop it somewhere, it's not gonna reach infinite speed because it exists in a certain context."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So the air around it is gonna generate friction and it's gonna block it at some top speed."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And even if you were to consider the broader context and lift the bottleneck there, like the bottleneck of friction, then some other part of the system would start stepping in and creating exponential friction, maybe the speed of flight or whatever."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And this definitely holds true when you look at the problem solving algorithm that is being run by science as an institution, science as a system."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "As you make more and more progress, despite having this recursive self improvement component, you are encountering exponential friction."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "The more researchers you have working on different ideas, the more overhead you have in terms of communication across researchers."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "If you look at, you were mentioning quantum mechanics, right?"}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Well, if you want to start making significant discoveries today, significant progress in quantum mechanics, there is an amount of knowledge you have to ingest, which is huge."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So there's a very large overhead to even start to contribute."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "There's a large amount of overhead to synchronize across researchers and so on."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And of course, the significant practical experiments are going to require exponentially expensive equipment because the easier ones have already been run, right?"}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So in your senses, there's no way escaping, there's no way of escaping this kind of friction with artificial intelligence systems."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Yeah, no, I think science is a very good way to model what would happen with a superhuman recursive research improving AI."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "That's your sense, I mean, the... That's my intuition."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "It's not like a mathematical proof of anything."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "That's not my point."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "Like, I'm not trying to prove anything."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "I'm just trying to make an argument to question the narrative of intelligence explosion, which is quite a dominant narrative."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And you do get a lot of pushback if you go against it."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "Because, so for many people, right, AI is not just a subfield of computer science."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It's more like a belief system."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Like this belief that the world is headed towards an event, the singularity, past which, you know, AI will become... will go exponential very much, and the world will be transformed, and humans will become obsolete."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And if you go against this narrative, because it is not really a scientific argument, but more of a belief system, it is part of the identity of many people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "If you go against this narrative, it's like you're attacking the identity of people who believe in it."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It's almost like saying God doesn't exist, or something."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So you do get a lot of pushback if you try to question these ideas."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "First of all, I believe most people, they might not be as eloquent or explicit as you're being, but most people in computer science are most people who actually have built anything that you could call AI, quote, unquote, would agree with you."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "They might not be describing in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "It's more, so the pushback you're getting is from people who get attached to the narrative from, not from a place of science, but from a place of imagination."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "That's correct, that's correct."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So why do you think that's so appealing?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Because the usual dreams that people have when you create a superintelligence system past the singularity, that what people imagine is somehow always destructive."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Do you have, if you were put on your psychology hat, what's, why is it so appealing to imagine the ways that all of human civilization will be destroyed?"}, {"time": 1640, "text": "I think it's a good story."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "You know, it's a good story."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And very interestingly, it mirrors a religious stories, right, religious mythology."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "If you look at the mythology of most civilizations, it's about the world being headed towards some final events in which the world will be destroyed and some new world order will arise that will be mostly spiritual, like the apocalypse followed by a paradise probably, right?"}, {"time": 1669, "text": "It's a very appealing story on a fundamental level."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And we all need stories."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "We all need stories to structure the way we see the world, especially at timescales that are beyond our ability to make predictions, right?"}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So on a more serious non exponential explosion, question, do you think there will be a time when we'll create something like human level intelligence or intelligent systems that will make you sit back and be just surprised at damn how smart this thing is?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "That doesn't require exponential growth or an exponential improvement, but what's your sense of the timeline and so on that you'll be really surprised at certain capabilities?"}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And we'll talk about limitations and deep

you've written quite eloquently about the limits of deep learning, was there a moment that you thought that maybe deep learning is limitless?"}, {"time": 1770, "text": "No, I don't think I've ever believed this."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "What was really shocking is that it worked."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "It worked at all, yeah."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "But there's a big jump between being able to do really good computer vision and human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So I don't think at any point I wasn't under the impression that the results we got in computer vision meant that we were very close to human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "I don't think we're very close to human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "I do believe that there's no reason why we won't achieve it at some point."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I also believe that it's the problem with talking about human level intelligence that implicitly you're considering like an axis of intelligence with different levels, but that's not really how intelligence works."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Intelligence is very multi dimensional."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so there's the question of capabilities, but there's also the question of being human like, and it's two very different things."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Like you can build potentially very advanced intelligent agents that are not human like at all."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And you can also build very human like agents."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And these are two very different things, right?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Let's go from the philosophical to the practical."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Can you give me a history of Keras and all the major deep learning frameworks that you kind of remember in relation to Keras and in general, TensorFlow, Theano, the old days."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Can you give a brief overview Wikipedia style history and your role in it before we return to AGI discussions?"}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Yeah, that's a broad topic."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So I started working on Keras."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "It was the name Keras at the time."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "I actually picked the name like just the day I was going to release it."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "So I started working on it in February, 2015."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And so at the time there weren't too many people working on deep learning, maybe like fewer than 10,000."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "The software tooling was not really developed."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So the main deep learning library was Cafe, which was mostly C++."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "Why do you say Cafe was the main one?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Cafe was vastly more popular than Theano in late 2014, early 2015."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Cafe was the one library that everyone was using for computer vision."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And computer vision was the most popular problem in deep learning at the time."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "Like ConvNets was like the subfield of deep learning that everyone was working on."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So myself, so in late 2014, I was actually interested in RNNs, in recurrent neural networks, which was a very niche topic at the time, right?"}, {"time": 1925, "text": "It really took off around 2016."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And so I was looking for good tools."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "I had used Torch 7, I had used Theano, used Theano a lot in Kaggle competitions."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "I had used Cafe."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And there was no like good solution for RNNs at the time."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Like there was no reusable open source implementation of an LSTM, for instance."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So I decided to build my own."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And at first, the pitch for that was, it was gonna be mostly around LSTM recurrent neural networks."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "It was gonna be in Python."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "An important decision at the time that was kind of not obvious is that the models would be defined via Python code, which was kind of like going against the mainstream at the time because Cafe, Pylon 2, and so on, like all the big libraries were actually going with the approach of setting configuration files in YAML to define models."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So some libraries were using code to define models, like Torch 7, obviously, but that was not Python."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Lasagne was like a Theano based very early library that was, I think, developed, I don't remember exactly, probably late 2014."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "It's Python as well."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was like on top of Theano."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And so I started working on something and the value proposition at the time was that not only what I think was the first reusable open source implementation of LSTM, you could combine RNNs and covenants with the same library, which is not really possible before, like Cafe was only doing covenants."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And it was kind of easy to use because, so before I was using Theano, I was actually using scikitlin and I loved scikitlin for its usability."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So I drew a lot of inspiration from scikitlin when I made Keras."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "It's almost like scikitlin for neural networks."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "The fit function."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Exactly, the fit function, like reducing a complex string loop to a single function call, right?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And of course, some people will say, this is hiding a lot of details, but that's exactly the point, right?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "The magic is the point."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So it's magical, but in a good way."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "It's magical in the sense that it's delightful."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "I'm actually quite surprised."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "I didn't know that it was born out of desire to implement RNNs and LSTMs."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So you were actually one of the first people to really try to attempt to get the major architectures together."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And it's also interesting."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "You made me realize that that was a design decision at all is defining the model and code."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Just, I'm putting myself in your shoes, whether the YAML, especially if cafe was the most popular."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "It was the most popular by far."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "If I was, if I were, yeah, I don't, I didn't like the YAML thing, but it makes more sense that you will put in a configuration file, the definition of a model."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "That's an interesting gutsy move to stick with defining it in code."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Just if you look back."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "Other libraries were doing it as well, but it was definitely the more niche option."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Okay, Keras and then."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So I released Keras in March, 2015, and it got users pretty much from the start."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "So the deep learning community was very, very small at the time."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "Lots of people were starting to be interested in LSTM."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So it was gonna release it at the right time because it was offering an easy to use LSTM implementation."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "Exactly at the time where lots of people started to be intrigued by the capabilities of RNN, RNNs for NLP."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "So it grew from there."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Then I joined Google about six months later, and that was actually completely unrelated to Keras."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "So I actually joined a research team working on image classification, mostly like computer vision."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So I was doing computer vision research at Google initially."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And immediately when I joined Google, I was exposed to the early internal version of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And the way it appeared to me at the time, and it was definitely the way it was at the time is that this was an improved version of Theano."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So I immediately knew I had to port Keras to this new TensorFlow thing."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And I was actually very busy as a noobler, as a new Googler."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "So I had not time to work on that."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "But then in November, I think it was November, 2015, TensorFlow got released."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And it was kind of like my wake up call that, hey, I had to actually go and make it happen."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "So in December, I ported Keras to run on top of TensorFlow, but it was not exactly a port."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "It was more like a refactoring where I was abstracting away all the backend functionality into one module so that the same code base could run on top of multiple backends."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So on top of TensorFlow or Theano."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And for the next year, Theano stayed as the default option."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "It was easier to use, somewhat less buggy."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "It was much faster, especially when it came to audience."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "But eventually, TensorFlow overtook it."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "And TensorFlow, the early TensorFlow, has similar architectural decisions as Theano, right?"}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So it was a natural transition."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So what, I mean, that still Keras is a side, almost fun project, right?"}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Yeah, so it was not my job assignment."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It was not."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "I was doing it on the side."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "And even though it grew to have a lot of users for a deep learning library at the time, like Stroud 2016, but I wasn't doing it as my main job."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So things started changing in, I think it must have been maybe October, 2016."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "So one year later."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So Rajat, who was the lead on TensorFlow, basically showed up one day in our building where I was doing like, so I was doing research and things like, so I did a lot of computer vision research, also collaborations with Christian Zighetti and deep learning for theorem proving."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "It was a really interesting research topic."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "And so Rajat was saying, hey, we saw Keras, we like it."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "We saw that you're at Google."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "Why don't you come over for like a quarter and work with us?"}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And I was like, yeah, that sounds like a great opportunity."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And so I started working on integrating the Keras API into TensorFlow more tightly."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "So what followed up is a sort of like temporary TensorFlow only version of Keras that was in TensorFlow.com Trib for a while."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And finally moved to TensorFlow Core."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "And I've never actually gotten back to my old team doing research."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Well, it's kind of funny that somebody like you who dreams of, or at least sees the power of AI systems that reason and theorem proving we'll talk about has also created a system that makes the most basic kind of Lego building that is deep learning super accessible, super easy."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "So beautifully so."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "It's a funny irony that you're both, you're responsible for both things, but so TensorFlow 2.0 is kind of, there's a sprint."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "I don't know how long it'll take, but there's a sprint towards the finish."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "What do you look, what are you working on these days?"}, {"time": 2401, "text": "What are you excited about?"}, {"time": 2402, "text": "What are you excited about in 2.0?"}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I mean, eager execution."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "There's so many things that just make it a lot easier to work."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "What are you excited about and what's also really hard?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "What are the problems you have to kind of solve?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "So I've spent the past year and a half working on TensorFlow 2.0 and it's been a long journey."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "I'm actually extremely excited about it."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think it's a great product."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "It's a delightful product compared to TensorFlow 1.0."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "We've made huge progress."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "So on the Keras side, what I'm really excited about is that, so previously Keras has been this very easy to use high level interface to do deep learning."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "But if you wanted to, if you wanted a lot of flexibility, the Keras framework was probably not the optimal way to do things compared to just writing everything from scratch."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "So in some way, the framework was getting in the way."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And in TensorFlow 2.0, you don't have this at all, actually."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "You have the usability of the high level interface, but you have the flexibility of this lower level interface."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "And you have this spectrum of workflows where you can get more or less usability and flexibility trade offs depending on your needs, right?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "You can write everything from scratch and you get a lot of help doing so by subclassing models and writing some train loops using ego execution."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "It's very flexible, it's very easy to debug, it's very powerful."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "But all of this integrates seamlessly with higher level features up to the classic Keras workflows, which are very scikit learn like and are ideal for a data scientist, machine learning engineer type of profile."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "So now you can have the same framework offering the same set of APIs that enable a spectrum of workflows that are more or less low level, more or less high level that are suitable for profiles ranging from researchers to data scientists and everything in between."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Yeah, so that's super exciting."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "I mean, it's not just that, it's connected to all kinds of tooling."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "You can go on mobile, you can go with TensorFlow Lite, you can go in the cloud or serving and so on."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "It all is connected together."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "Now some of the best software written ever is often done by one person, sometimes two."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "So with a Google, you're now seeing sort of Keras having to be integrated in TensorFlow, I'm sure has a ton of engineers working on."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And there's, I'm sure a lot of tricky design decisions to be made."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "How does that process usually happen from at least your perspective?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "What are the debates like?"}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Is there a lot of thinking, considering different options and so on?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So a lot of the time I spend at Google is actually discussing design discussions, right?"}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Writing design docs, participating in design review meetings and so on."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "This is as important as actually writing a code."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "So there's a lot of thought, there's a lot of thought and a lot of care that is taken in coming up with these decisions and taking into account all of our users because TensorFlow has this extremely diverse user base, right?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "It's not like just one user segment where everyone has the same needs."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "We have small scale production users, large scale production users."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "We have startups, we have researchers, you know, it's all over the place."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "And we have to cater to all of their needs."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "If I just look at the standard debates of C++ or Python, there's some heated debates."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Do you have those at Google?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "I mean, they're not heated in terms of emotionally, but there's probably multiple ways to do it, right?"}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So how do you arrive through those design meetings at the best way to do it?"}, {"time": 2655, "text": "Especially in deep learning where the field is evolving as you're doing it."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Is there some magic to it?"}, {"time": 2663, "text": "Is there some magic to the process?"}, {"time": 2666, "text": "I don't know if there's magic to the process, but there definitely is a process."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "So making design decisions is about satisfying a set of constraints, but also trying to do so in the simplest way possible, because this is what can be maintained, this is what can be expanded in the future."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So you don't want to naively satisfy the constraints by just, you know, for each capability you need available, you're gonna come up with one argument in your API and so on."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "You want to design APIs that are modular and hierarchical so that they have an API surface that is as small as possible, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "And you want this modular hierarchical architecture to reflect the way that domain experts think about the problem."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Because as a domain expert, when you are reading about a new API, you're reading a tutorial or some docs pages, you already have a way that you're thinking about the problem."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "You already have like certain concepts in mind and you're thinking about how they relate together."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "And when you're reading docs, you're trying to build as quickly as possible a mapping between the concepts featured in your API and the concepts in your mind."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "So you're trying to map your mental model as a domain expert to the way things work in the API."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So you need an API and an underlying implementation that are reflecting the way people think about these things."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "So in minimizing the time it takes to do the mapping."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Yes, minimizing the time, the cognitive load there is in ingesting this new knowledge about your API."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "An API should not be self referential or referring to implementation details."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "It should only be referring to domain specific concepts that people already understand."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So what's the future of Keras and TensorFlow look like?"}, {"time": 2787, "text": "What does TensorFlow 3.0 look like?"}, {"time": 2790, "text": "So that's kind of too far in the future for me to answer, especially since I'm not even the one making these decisions."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "But so from my perspective, which is just one perspective among many different perspectives on the TensorFlow team, I'm really excited by developing even higher level APIs, higher level than Keras."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "I'm really excited by hyperparameter tuning, by automated machine learning, AutoML."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "I think the future is not just, you know, defining a model like you were assembling Lego blocks and then collect fit on it."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "It's more like an automagical model that would just look at your data and optimize the objective you're after, right?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "So that's what I'm looking into."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Yeah, so you put the baby into a room with the problem and come back a few hours later with a fully solved problem."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "Exactly, it's not like a box of Legos."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "It's more like the combination of a kid that's really good at Legos and a box of Legos."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "It's just building the thing on its own."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "So that's an exciting future."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "I think there's a huge amount of applications and revolutions to be had under the constraints of the discussion we previously had."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "But what do you think of the current limits of deep learning?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "If we look specifically at these function approximators that tries to generalize from data."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "You've talked about local versus extreme generalization."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "You mentioned that neural networks don't generalize well and humans do."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So there's this gap."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And you've also mentioned that extreme generalization requires something like reasoning to fill those gaps."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "So how can we start trying to build systems like that?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "Right, yeah, so this is by design, right?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Deep learning models are like huge parametric models, differentiable, so continuous, that go from an input space to an output space."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And they're trained with gradient descent."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So they're trained pretty much point by point."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "They are learning a continuous geometric morphing from an input vector space to an output vector space."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And because this is done point by point, a deep neural network can only make sense of points in experience space that are very close to things that it has already seen in string data."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "At best, it can do interpolation across points."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "But that means in order to train your network, you need a dense sampling of the input cross output space, almost a point by point sampling, which can be very expensive if you're dealing with complex real world problems, like autonomous driving, for instance, or robotics."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "It's doable if you're looking at the subset of the visual space."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "But even then, it's still fairly expensive."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "You still need millions of examples."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And it's only going to be able to make sense of things that are very close to what it has seen before."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And in contrast to that, well, of course, you have human intelligence."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "But even if you're not looking at human intelligence, you can look at very simple rules, algorithms."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "If you have a symbolic rule, it can actually apply to a very, very large set of inputs because it is abstract."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "It is not obtained by doing a point by point mapping."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "For instance, if you try to learn a sorting algorithm using a deep neural network, well, you're very much limited to learning point by point what the sorted representation of this specific list is like."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "But instead, you could have a very, very simple sorting algorithm written in a few lines."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Maybe it's just two nested loops."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "And it can process any list at all because it is abstract, because it is a set of rules."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "So deep learning is really like point by point geometric morphings, train with good and decent."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And meanwhile, abstract rules can generalize much better."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "And I think the future is we need to combine the two."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So how do we, do you think, combine the two?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "How do we combine good point by point functions with programs, which is what the symbolic AI type systems?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "At which levels the combination happen?"}, {"time": 3071, "text": "I mean, obviously we're jumping into the realm of where there's no good answers."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "It's just kind of ideas and intuitions and so on."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Well, if you look at the really successful AI systems today, I think they are already hybrid systems that are combining symbolic AI with deep learning."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "For instance, successful robotics systems are already mostly model based, rule based, things like planning algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "At the same time, they're using deep learning as perception modules."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Sometimes they're using deep learning as a way to inject fuzzy intuition into a rule based process."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "If you look at the system like in a self driving car, it's not just one big end to end neural network."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "You know, that wouldn't work at all."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "Precisely because in order to train that, you would need a dense sampling of experience base when it comes to driving, which is completely unrealistic, obviously."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Instead, the self driving car is mostly symbolic, you know, it's software, it's programmed by hand."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So it's mostly based on explicit models."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "In this case, mostly 3D models of the environment around the car, but it's interfacing with the real world using deep learning modules, right?"}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So the deep learning there serves as a way to convert the raw sensory information to something usable by symbolic systems."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "Okay, well, let's linger on that a little more."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So dense sampling from input

data is the bottleneck."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And I think we are already starting to be in a regime where our systems are so large in scale and so data ingrained that data today and the quality

we are going to move from a focus on a computation scale to focus on data efficiency."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "Data efficiency."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "So that's getting to the question of symbolic AI."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "But to linger on the deep learning approaches, do you have hope for either unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, which are ways of being more data

it at scale in terms of scaling this to many, many people, to entire populations."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So potentially, artificial intelligence, even in its current state, if you combine it with the internet, with the fact that all of our lives are moving to digital devices and digital information consumption and creation, what you get is the possibility to achieve mass manipulation of

pushback."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "So there are many ways in which social media platforms can potentially control your opinions."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "And today, so all of these things are

that kind of philosophical discussion?"}, {"time": 4591, "text": "I think you can definitely try."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "So from my perspective, I would feel rather uncomfortable with companies

about."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "I would like all these algorithms to present configuration settings to their users, so that the users can actually make the decision about how they want to be

learning."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "So yeah, the user should be able to determine exactly how these algorithms are affecting their lives."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "I don't want actually any entity

to be our interface to a world that is increasingly made of information."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And I want everyone to be in control of this interface, to interface with the world on their own

a human judge or a panel of human judges."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "So it's a total copout, right?"}, {"time": 5738, "text": "If you want to measure how human like an agent is, I think you have to make it interact with other humans."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Maybe it's not necessarily a good idea to have these other humans be the judges."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "Maybe you should just observe

intelligence."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "So we're already talking about two things, right?"}, {"time": 5773, "text": "The degree, kind of like the magnitude of an intelligence and its direction, right?"}, {"time": 5780, "text": "Like the norm of a vector and its direction."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And the direction is like human likeness and the magnitude, the norm is intelligence."},

different benchmarks for intelligence today, they're all too focused on skill at a given task."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "Like skill at playing chess, skill at playing Go, skill at playing Dota."},

or juggling or anything is impressive is because we are expressing this skill within a certain set of constraints."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "So if you want to measure intelligence, you need to rigorously define what intelligence is, which in itself, you know, it's a very challenging problem."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And do you think that's possible?"}, {"time": 5884, "text": "To define intelligence?"}, {"time": 5886, "text": "I mean, you can provide, many people have provided, you know, some definition."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "I have my own definition."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "Where does your definition begin?"}, {"time": 5893, "text": "Where does your definition begin if it doesn't end?"}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Well, I think intelligence is essentially the efficiency with which you turn experience into generalizable programs."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "So what that means is it's the efficiency with which you turn a sampling of experience space into the ability to process a larger chunk of experience space."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "So measuring skill can be one proxy across many different tasks, can be one proxy for measuring intelligence."}, {"time": 5934,

your system has."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "But if you look at two agents and you give them the same priors and you give them the same amount of experience, there is one of the agents that is going to learn programs, representations, something, a model that will perform well on the larger chunk of experience space than the other."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And that is the smaller agent."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "So if you fix the experience, which generate better programs, better meaning more generalizable."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "That's a very nice, clean definition of...

space."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "You're talking about priors and you're talking about experience."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "All of these things define the context in which intelligence emerges."},

sufficiently large, the experience space, even though it's specialized."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "There's a certain point when the experience space is large enough to where it might as well be general."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "It feels general."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "It looks general."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "I mean, it's very relative."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "Like, for instance, many people would say human intelligence is general."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "In fact, it is quite specialized."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "We can definitely build systems that start from the same innate priors as what humans have at birth."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "Because we already understand fairly well what sort of priors we have as humans."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "Like many people have worked on this problem."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "Most notably, Elisabeth Spelke from Harvard."}, {"time": 6051, "text": "I don't know if you know her."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "She's worked a lot on what she calls core knowledge."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "And it is very much about trying to determine and describe what priors we are born with."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Like language skills and so on, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So we have some pretty good understanding of what priors we are born with."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "So we could..."}, {"time": 6073,

you play this game, that does not change your skill at the game."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Can you picture that?"}, {"time": 6125, "text": "As a person who deeply appreciates practice, I cannot actually."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "There's actually a very simple trick."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "So in order to come up with a task, so the only thing you can measure is skill at the task."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "All tasks are going to involve priors."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "The trick is to know what they are and to describe that."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "And then you make sure that this is the same set of priors as what humans start with."}, {"time": 6153, "text": "So you create a task that assumes these priors, that exactly documents these priors, so that the priors are made explicit and there are no other priors involved."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And then you generate a certain number of samples in experience space for this task, right?"}, {"time": 6169, "text": "And this, for one task, assuming that the task is new for the agent passing it, that's one test of this definition of intelligence that we set up."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "And now you can scale that to many different tasks, that each task should be new to the agent passing it, right?"}, {"time": 6191, "text": "And also it should be human interpretable and understandable so that you can actually have a human pass the same test."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "And then you can compare the score of your machine and the score of your human."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "Which could be a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "You could even start a task like MNIST."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "Just as long as you start with the same set of priors."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "So the problem with MNIST, humans are already trying to recognize digits, right?"}, {"time": 6215, "text": "But let's say we're considering objects that are not digits, some completely arbitrary patterns."},

of progress has been made."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "There's been a lot of good tests and basically reducing all of human vision into some good priors."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "We're still probably

knowledge priors."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Objectness, cool."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "Objectness, yeah."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "So we have priors about objectness, like about the visual space, about time, about agents, about goal oriented behavior."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "We have many different priors, but what's interesting is that, sure, we have this pretty diverse and rich set of priors, but it's also not that diverse, right?"}, {"time": 6286, "text": "We are not born into this world with a ton of knowledge about the world, with only a small set of core knowledge."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "Yeah, sorry, do you have a sense of how it feels to us humans that that set is not that large?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "But just even the nature of time that we kind of integrate pretty effectively through all of our perception, all of our reasoning, maybe how, you know, do you have a sense of how easy it is to encode those priors?"}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Maybe it requires building a universe and then the human brain in order to encode those priors."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "Or do you have a hope that it can be listed like an axiomatic?"}, {"time": 6329, "text": "So you have to keep in mind that any knowledge about the world that we are born with is something that has to have been encoded into our DNA by evolution at some point."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "And DNA is a very, very low bandwidth medium."}, {"time": 6346, "text": "Like it's extremely long and expensive to encode anything into DNA because first of all, you need some sort of evolutionary pressure to guide this writing process."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "And then, you know, the higher level of information you're trying to write, the longer it's going to take."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And the thing in the environment that you're trying to encode knowledge about has to be stable over this duration."}, {"time": 6375, "text": "So you can only encode into DNA things that constitute an evolutionary advantage."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "So this is actually a very small subset of all possible knowledge about the world."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "You can only encode things that are stable, that are true, over very, very long periods of time, typically millions of years."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "For instance, we might have some visual prior about the shape of snakes, right?"}, {"time": 6398, "text": "But what makes a face, what's the difference between a face and an art face?"}, {"time": 6404, "text": "But consider this interesting question."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Do we have any innate sense of the visual difference between a male face and a female face?"}, {"time": 6418, "text": "For a human, I mean."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "I would have to look back into evolutionary history when the genders emerged."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "But yeah, most..."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "I mean, the faces of humans are quite different from the faces of great apes."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "Great apes, right?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "Yeah, you couldn't tell the face of a female chimpanzee from the face of a male chimpanzee, probably."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "Yeah, and I don't think most humans have all that ability."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "So we do have innate knowledge of what makes a face, but it's actually impossible for us to have any DNA encoded knowledge of the difference between a female human face and a male human face because that knowledge, that information came up into the world actually very recently."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "If you look at the slowness of the process of encoding knowledge into DNA."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "Yeah, so that's interesting."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "That's a really powerful argument that DNA is a low bandwidth and it takes a long time to encode."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "That naturally creates a very efficient encoding."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "But one important consequence of this is that, so yes, we are born into this world with a bunch of knowledge, sometimes high level knowledge about the world, like the shape, the rough shape of a snake, of the rough shape of a face."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "But importantly, because this knowledge takes so long to write, almost all of this innate knowledge is shared with our cousins, with great apes, right?"}, {"time": 6512, "text": "So it is not actually this innate knowledge that makes us special."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "But to throw it right back at you from the earlier on in our discussion, it's that encoding might also include the entirety of the environment of Earth."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "To some extent."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So it can include things that are important to survival and production, so for which there is some evolutionary pressure, and things that are stable, constant over very, very, very long time periods."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "And honestly, it's not that much information."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "There's also, besides the bandwidths constraint and the constraints of the writing process, there's also memory constraints, like DNA, the part of DNA that deals with the human brain, it's actually fairly small."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "It's like, you know, on the order of megabytes, right?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "There's not that much high level knowledge about the world you can encode."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "That's quite brilliant and hopeful for a benchmark that you're referring to of encoding priors."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "I actually look forward to, I'm skeptical whether you can do it in the next couple of years, but hopefully."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "I've been working."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "So honestly, it's a very simple benchmark, and it's not like a big breakthrough or anything."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "It's more like a fun side project, right?"}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But these fun, so is ImageNet."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "These fun side projects could launch entire groups of efforts towards creating reasoning systems and so on."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "And I think... Yeah, that's the goal."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "It's trying to measure strong generalization, to measure the strength of abstraction in our minds, well, in our minds and in artificial intelligence

competition."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "So that's an exciting possibility."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "If you, do you think an AI winter is coming?"}, {"time": 6633, "text": "And how do we prevent it?"}, {"time": 6636, "text": "So an AI winter is something that would occur when there's a big mismatch between how we are selling the capabilities of AI and the actual capabilities of AI."},

6666, "text": "So deep learning will keep creating a lot of value for the time being."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "What's concerning, however, is that there's a lot of hype around deep learning and

but for trust, right?"}, {"time": 6762, "text": "And maybe this will, you know, this will be what enables you to raise a lot of money, but ultimately you are creating damage, you are damaging the field."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "So that's the concern is that that debt, that's what happens with the other AI winters is the concern is you actually tweeted about this with autonomous vehicles, right?"}, {"time": 6784, "text": "There's almost every single company now have promised that they will have full autonomous vehicles by 2021, 2022."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "That's a good example of the consequences of over hyping the capabilities of AI and the pace of progress."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "So because I work especially a lot recently in this area, I have a deep concern of what happens when all of these companies after I've invested billions have a meeting and say, how much do we actually, first of all, do we have an autonomous vehicle?"}, {"time": 6813, "text": "The answer will definitely be no."}, {"time": 6815, "text": "And second will be, wait a minute, we've invested one, two, three, four billion dollars into this and we made no profit."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "And the reaction to that may be going very hard in other directions that might impact even other industries."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "And that's what we call an AI winter is when there is backlash where no one believes any of these promises anymore because they've turned that to be big lies the first time around."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "And this will definitely happen to some extent for autonomous vehicles because the public and decision makers have been convinced that around 2015, they've been convinced by these people who are trying to raise money for their startups and so on, that L5 driving was coming in maybe 2016, maybe 2017, maybe 2018."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "Now we're in 2019, we're still waiting for it."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And so I don't believe we are going to have a full on AI winter because we have these technologies that are producing a tremendous amount of real value."}, {"time": 6877, "text": "But there is also too much hype."}, {"time": 6879, "text":

group of people in the world?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Do we think about the savants who can close their eyes and give you a number?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "We think about the think tanks, or the

think it's the latter."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "And my point is that how do you train someone to do that?"}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And that's what I mean by it's hard."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "How do you, what's the process of training people to do that well?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "That's a hard process."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "We work, as a society, we work pretty hard to get other people to understand our thinking and to convince them of things."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Now we could persuade them, obviously you talked about this, like human flaws or weaknesses, we can persuade them through emotional means."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "But to get them to understand and connect to and follow a logical argument is difficult."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "We try it, we do it, we do it as scientists, we try to do it as journalists, we try to do it as even artists in many forms, as writers, as teachers."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "We go through a fairly significant training process to do that."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And then we could ask, well, why is that so hard?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "But it's hard."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And for humans, it takes a lot of work."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And when we step back and say, well, how do we get a machine to do that?"}, {"time": 1309, "text": "It's a vexing question."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "How would you begin to try to solve that?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And maybe just a quick pause, because there's an optimistic notion in the things you're describing, which is being able to explain something through reason."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "But if you look at algorithms that recommend things that we'll look at next, whether it's Facebook, Google, advertisement based companies, their goal is to convince you to buy things based on anything."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So that could be reason, because the best of advertisement is showing you things that you really do need and explain why you need it."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But it could also be through emotional manipulation."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "The algorithm that describes why a certain decision was made, how hard is it to do it through emotional manipulation?"}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And why is that a good or a bad thing?"}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So you've kind of focused on reason, logic, really showing in a clear way why something is good."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "One, is that even a thing that us humans do?"}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And two, how do you think of the difference in the reasoning aspect

them."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "And these algorithms are saying, look, that's up to you to reason whether you need something or not."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "That's your job."}, {"time": 1473,

stuff like that."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And I just feed you more of the same stuff."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "That's very different than kind of getting in there and saying, what does this mean?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "The stuff you're reading, like why are you reading it?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "What assumptions are you bringing to the table?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "Are those

there's interpretation and judgment involved in that process that isn't really happening in the AI today."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "That's harder because you have to start getting at the meaning of the stuff, of the content."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "You have to get at how humans interpret the content relative to their value system and deeper thought processes."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So that's what meaning means is not just some kind of deep, timeless, semantic thing that the statement represents, but also how a large number of people are likely to interpret."}, {"time": 1695,

on a canvas, what does it mean to you?"}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And it may mean different things to different people because of their different experiences."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "It may mean something even different to the artist who painted it."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "As we try to get more rigorous with our communication, we try to really nail down that meaning."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So we go from abstract art to precise mathematics, precise engineering drawings and things like that."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "We're really trying to say, I wanna narrow that space of possible interpretations because the precision of the communication ends up becoming more and more important."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "And so that means that I have to specify, and I think that's why this becomes really hard, because if I'm just showing you an artifact and you're looking at it superficially, whether it's a bunch of words on a page, or whether it's brushstrokes on a canvas or pixels on a photograph, you can sit there and you can interpret lots of different ways at many, many different levels."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "But when I wanna align our understanding of that, I have to specify a lot more stuff that's actually not directly in the artifact."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "Now I have to say, well, how are you interpreting this image and that image?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And what about the colors and what do they mean to you?"}, {"time": 1799, "text": "What perspective are you bringing to the table?"}, {"time": 1802, "text": "What are your prior experiences with those artifacts?"}, {"time": 1805, "text": "What are your fundamental assumptions and values?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "What is your ability to kind of reason, to chain together logical

"text": "So your reasoning processes and how they work, your prior models and what they are, your values and your assumptions, all those things now come together into the interpretation."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Getting in sync of that is hard."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And yet humans are able to intuit some of that without any pre."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "Because they have the shared experience."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And we're not talking about shared, two people having shared experience."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "I mean, as a society."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "We have the shared experience and we have similar brains."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So we tend to, in other words, part of our shared experiences are shared local experience."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "Like we may live in the same culture, we may live in the same society and therefore we have similar educations."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "We have some of what we like to call prior models about the word prior experiences."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And we use that as a, think of it as a wide collection of interrelated variables and they're all bound to similar things."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "And so we take that as our background and we start interpreting things similarly."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "But as humans, we have a lot of shared experience."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "We do have similar brains, similar goals, similar emotions under similar circumstances."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Because we're both humans."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So now one of the early questions you asked, how is biological and computer information systems fundamentally different?"}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Well, one is humans come with a lot of pre programmed stuff."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "A ton of program stuff."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And they're able to communicate because they share that stuff."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Do you think that shared knowledge, if we can maybe escape the hard work question, how much is encoded in the hardware?"}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Just the shared knowledge in the software, the history, the many centuries of wars and so on that came to today, that shared knowledge."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "How hard is it to encode?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Do you have a hope?"}, {"time": 1935, "text": "Can you speak to how hard is it to encode that knowledge systematically in a way that could be used by a computer?"}, {"time": 1942, "text": "So I think it is possible to learn to, for a machine to program a machine, to acquire that knowledge with a similar foundation."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "In other words, a similar interpretive foundation for processing that knowledge."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So in other words, we view the world in a particular way."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So in other words, we have a, if you will, as humans, we have a framework for interpreting the world around us."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "So we have multiple frameworks for interpreting the world around us."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "But if you're interpreting, for example, socio political interactions, you're thinking about where there's people, there's collections and groups of people, they have goals, goals largely built around survival and quality of life."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "There are fundamental economics around scarcity of resources."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And when humans come and start interpreting a situation like that, because you brought up like historical events, they start interpreting situations like that."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "They apply a lot of this fundamental framework for interpreting that."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Well, who are the people?"}, {"time": 2012, "text": "What were their goals?"}, {"time": 2013, "text": "What resources did they have?"}, {"time": 2015, "text": "How much power influence did they have over the other?"}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Like this fundamental substrate, if you will, for interpreting and reasoning about that."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "So I think it is possible to imbue a computer with that stuff that humans like take for granted when they go and sit down and try to interpret things."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "And then with that foundation, they acquire, they start acquiring the details, the specifics in a given situation, are then able to interpret it with regard to that framework."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "And then given that interpretation, they can do what?"}, {"time": 2048, "text": "They can predict."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "But not only can they predict, they can predict now with an explanation that can be given in those terms, in the terms of that underlying framework that most humans share."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Now you could find humans that come and interpret events very differently than other humans because they're like using a different framework."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "The movie Matrix comes to mind where they decided humans were really just batteries, and that's how they interpreted the value of humans as a source of electrical energy."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So, but I think that for the most part, we have a way of interpreting the events or the social events around us because we have this shared framework."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "It comes from, again, the fact that we're similar beings that have similar goals, similar emotions, and we can make sense out of these."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "These frameworks make sense to us."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So how much knowledge is there, do you think?"}, {"time": 2108, "text": "So you said it's possible."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Well, there's a tremendous amount of detailed knowledge in the world."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "You could imagine effectively infinite number of unique situations and unique configurations of these things."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "But the knowledge that you need, what I refer to as like the frameworks, for you need for interpreting them, I don't think."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "I think those are finite."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "You think the frameworks are more important than the bulk of the knowledge?"}, {"time": 2136, "text": "So it's like framing."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Yeah, because what the frameworks do is they give you now the ability to interpret and reason, and to interpret and reason, to interpret and reason over the specifics in ways that other humans would understand."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "What about the specifics?"}, {"time": 2151, "text": "You know, you acquire the specifics by reading and by talking to other people."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "So I'm mostly actually just even, if we can focus on even the beginning, the common sense stuff, the stuff that doesn't even require reading, or it almost requires playing around with the world or something, just being able to sort of manipulate objects, drink water and so on, all of that."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "Every time we try to do that kind of thing in robotics or AI, it seems to be like an onion."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "You seem to realize how much knowledge is really required to perform even some of these basic tasks."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "Do you have that sense as well?"}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And if so, how do we get all those details?"}, {"time": 2193, "text": "Are they written down somewhere?"}, {"time": 2195, "text": "Do they have to be learned through experience?"}, {"time": 2199, "text": "So I think when, like, if you're talking about sort of the physics, the basic physics around us, for example, acquiring information about, acquiring how that works."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think there's a combination of things going, I think there's a combination of things going on."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "I think there is like fundamental pattern matching, like what we were talking about before, where you see enough examples, enough data about something and you start assuming that."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "And with similar input, I'm gonna predict similar outputs."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "You can't necessarily explain it at all."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "You may learn very quickly that when you let something go, it falls to the ground."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "But you can't necessarily explain that."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "But that's such a deep idea, that if you let something go, like the idea of gravity."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "I mean, people are letting things go and counting on them falling well before they understood gravity."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "But that seems to be, that's exactly what I mean, is before you take a physics class or study anything about Newton, just the idea that stuff falls to the ground and then you'd be able to generalize that all kinds of stuff falls to the ground."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It just seems like a non, without encoding it, like hard coding it in, it seems like a difficult thing to pick up."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "It seems like you have to have a lot of different knowledge to be able to integrate that into the framework, sort of into everything else."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "So both know that stuff falls to the ground and start to reason about sociopolitical discourse."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "So both, like the very basic and the high level reasoning decision making."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "I guess my question is, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 2306, "text": "And sorry to linger on it because again, and we'll get to it for sure, as what Watson with Jeopardy did is take on a problem that's much more constrained but has the same hugeness of scale, at least from the outsider's perspective."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "So I'm asking the general life question of to be able to be an intelligent being and reason in the world about both gravity and politics, how hard is that problem?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "So I think it's solvable."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "Okay, now beautiful."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "So what about time travel?"}, {"time": 2344, "text": "Okay, I'm just saying the same answer."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "Not as convinced."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "Not as convinced yet, okay."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "No, I think it is solvable."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "I mean, I think that it's a learn, first of all, it's about getting machines to learn."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "Learning is fundamental."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "And I think we're already in a place that we understand, for example, how machines can learn in various ways."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "Right now, our learning stuff is sort of primitive in that we haven't sort of taught machines to learn the frameworks."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "We don't communicate our frameworks because of how shared they are, in some cases we do, but we don't annotate, if you will, all the data in the world with the frameworks that are inherent or underlying our understanding."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "Instead, we just operate with the data."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So if we wanna be able to reason over the data in similar terms in the common frameworks, we need to be able to teach the computer, or at least we need to program the computer to acquire, to have access to and acquire, learn the frameworks as well and connect the frameworks to the data."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "I think this can be done."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "I think we can start, I think machine learning, for example, with enough examples, can start to learn these basic dynamics."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "Will they relate them necessarily to the gravity?"}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Not unless they can also acquire those theories as well and put the experiential knowledge and connect it back to the theoretical knowledge."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "I think if we think in terms of these class of architectures that are designed to both learn the specifics, find the patterns, but also acquire the frameworks and connect the data to the frameworks."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "If we think in terms of robust architectures like this, I think there is a path toward getting there."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "In terms of encoding architectures like that, do you think systems that are able to do this will look like neural networks or representing, if you look back to the 80s and 90s with the expert systems, they're more like graphs, systems that are based in logic, able to contain a large amount of knowledge where the challenge was the automated acquisition of that knowledge."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "I guess the question is when you collect both the frameworks and the knowledge from the data, what do you think that thing will look like?"}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, I think asking the question, they look like neural networks is a bit of a red herring."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "I mean, I think that they will certainly do inductive or pattern match based reasoning."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "So for example, at elemental cognition, we do both."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "We have architectures that do both, both those things, but also have a learning method for acquiring the frameworks themselves and saying, look, ultimately, I need to take this data."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "I need to interpret it in the form of these frameworks so they can reason over it."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "So there is a fundamental knowledge representation, like what you're saying, like these graphs of logic, if you will."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "There are also neural networks that acquire a certain class of information."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "Then they then align them with these frameworks, but there's also a mechanism to acquire the frameworks themselves."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "Yeah, so it seems like the idea of frameworks requires some kind of collaboration with humans."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "So do you think of that collaboration as direct?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Well, and let's be clear."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "Only for the express purpose that you're designing, you're designing an intelligence that can ultimately communicate with humans in the terms of frameworks that help them understand things."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So to be really clear, you can independently create a machine learning system, an intelligence that I might call an alien intelligence that does a better job than you with some things, but can't explain the framework to you."},

of thousands of these things."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And it was a very, very long tail, meaning that it just went on and on."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "And so even if you focused on trying to encode the types at the very top, like there's five that were the most, let's say five of the most frequent, you still cover a very small percentage of the data."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "So you

first things, like what do you do about that?"}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And so we came up with an approach toward that."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "And the approach looked promising, and we continued to improve our ability to handle that problem throughout the project."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "The other issue was that right from the outside, I said, we're not going to, I committed to doing this in three to five years."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "So we did it in four."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "So I got lucky."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "But one of the things that that, putting that like stake

3960, "text": "I believed that the fundamental NLP technologies and machine learning technologies would be adequate."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "And this was an issue of how do we enhance them?"},

{"time": 4044, "text": "What would you search over?"}, {"time": 4046, "text": "So you have a question, how would you search the possible space of answers?"}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Look, web search has come a long way even since then."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "But at the time, first of all, I mean, there were a couple of other constraints around the problem, which is interesting."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "So you couldn't go out to the web."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "You couldn't search the internet."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "In other words, the AI experiment was, we want a self contained device."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "If the device is as big as a room, fine, it's as big as a room, but we want a self contained device."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "You're not going out to the

"So there was that limitation."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "But then we did, but the basic thing was go do web search."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Problem was, even when we went and did a web search, I don't remember exactly the numbers, but somewhere in the order of 65% of the time, the answer would be somewhere, you know, in the top 10 or 20 documents."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "So first of all, that's not even good enough to play Jeopardy."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "You know, the words, even if you could pull the, even if you could perfectly pull the answer out of the top 20 documents, top 10 documents, whatever it was, which we didn't know how to do."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "But even if you could do that, you'd be, and you knew it was right, unless you had enough confidence in it, right?"}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So you'd have to pull out the right answer."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "You'd have to have confidence it was the right answer."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "And then you'd have to do that fast enough to now go buzz in and you'd still only get 65% of them right, which doesn't even put you in the winner's circle."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "Winner's circle, you have to be up over 70 and you have to do it really quick and you have to do it really quickly."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "But now the problem is, well, even if I had somewhere in the top 10 documents, how do I figure out where in the top 10 documents that answer is and how do I compute a confidence of all the possible candidates?"}, {"time": 4159, "text": "So it's not like I go in knowing the right answer and I have to pick it."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "I don't know the right answer."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "I have a bunch of documents, somewhere in there is the right answer."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "How do I, as a machine, go out and figure out which one's right?"}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then how do I score it?"}, {"time": 4172, "text": "So, and now how do I deal with the fact that I can't actually go out to the web?"}, {"time": 4177, "text": "First of all, if you pause on that, just think about it."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "If you could go to the web, do you think that problem is solvable if you just pause on it?"}, {"time": 4185, "text": "Just thinking even beyond jeopardy, do you think the problem of reading text defined where the answer is?"}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Well, we solved that in some definition of solves given the jeopardy challenge."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "How did you do it for jeopardy?"}, {"time": 4199, "text": "So how do you take a body of work in a particular topic and extract the key pieces of information?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "So now forgetting about the huge volumes that are on the web, right?"}, {"time": 4210, "text": "So now we have to figure out, we did a lot of source research."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "In other words, what body of knowledge is gonna be small enough, but broad enough to answer jeopardy?"}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And we ultimately did find the body of knowledge that did that."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "I mean, it included Wikipedia and a bunch of other stuff."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "So like encyclopedia type of stuff."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "I don't know if you can speak to it."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "Encyclopedias, dictionaries, different types of semantic resources, like WordNet and other types of semantic resources like that, as well as like some web crawls."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "In other words, where we went out and took that content and then expanded it based on producing, statistically producing seeds, using those seeds for other searches and then expanding that."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "So using these like expansion techniques, we went out and had found enough content and we're like, okay, this is good."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "And even up until the end, we had a thread of research."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "It was always trying to figure out what content could we efficiently include."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of popular, like what is the church lady?"}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Well, I think was one of the, like what, where do you, I guess that's probably an encyclopedia, so."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "So that was an encyclopedia, but then we would take that stuff and we would go out and we would expand."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "In other words, we'd go find other content that wasn't in the core resources and expand it."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "The amount of content, we grew it by an order of magnitude, but still, again, from a web scale perspective, this is very small amount of content."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "It's very select."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "We then took all that content, we preanalyzed the crap out of it, meaning we parsed it, broke it down into all those individual words and then we did semantic, syntactic and semantic parses on it, had computer algorithms that annotated it and we indexed that in a very rich and very fast index."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "So we have a relatively huge amount of, let's say the equivalent of, for the sake of argument, two to 5 million bucks."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "We've now analyzed all that, blowing up its size even more because now we have all this metadata and then we richly indexed all of that and by the way, in a giant in memory cache."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So Watson did not go to disk."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "So the infrastructure component there, if you could just speak to it, how tough it, I mean, I know 2000, maybe this is 2008, nine, that's kind of a long time ago."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "How hard is it to use multiple machines?"}, {"time": 4348, "text": "How hard is the infrastructure component, the hardware component?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "So we used IBM hardware."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "We had something like, I forgot exactly, but close to 3000 cores completely connected."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So you had a switch where every CPU was connected to every other CPU."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "And they were sharing memory in some kind of way."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "Large shared memory, right?"}, {"time": 4367, "text": "And all this data was preanalyzed and put into a very fast indexing structure that was all in memory."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "And then we took that question, we would analyze the question."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "So all the content was now preanalyzed."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "So if I went and tried to find a piece of content, it would come back with all the metadata that we had precomputed."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "How do you shove that question?"}, {"time": 4396, "text": "How do you connect the big knowledge base with the metadata and that's indexed to the simple little witty confusing question?"}, {"time": 4407, "text": "So therein lies the Watson architecture, right?"}, {"time": 4411, "text": "So we would take the question, we would analyze the question."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "So which means that we would parse it and interpret it a bunch of different ways."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "We'd try to figure out what is it asking about?"}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So we had multiple strategies to kind of determine what was it asking for."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "That might be represented as a simple string, a character string, or something we would connect back to different semantic types that were from existing resources."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "So anyway, the bottom line is we would do a bunch of analysis in the question."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "And question analysis had to finish and had to finish fast."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "So we do the question analysis because then from the question analysis, we would now produce searches."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "So we would, and we had built using open source search engines, we modified them, but we had a number of different search engines we would use that had different characteristics."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "We went in there and engineered and modified those search engines, ultimately to now take our question analysis, produce multiple queries based on different interpretations of the question and fire out a whole bunch of searches in parallel."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "And they would come back with passages."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "So these are passive search algorithms."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "They would come back with passages."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "And so now let's say you had a thousand passages."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "Now for each passage, you parallelize again."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "So you went out and you parallelize the search."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "Each search would now come back with a whole bunch of passages."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Maybe you had a total of a thousand or 5,000 whatever passages."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "For each passage now, you'd go and figure out whether or not there was a candidate, we'd call it candidate answer in there."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "So you had a whole bunch of other algorithms that would find candidate answers, possible answers to the question."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And so you had candidate answer, called candidate answer generators, a whole bunch of those."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "So for every one of these components, the team was constantly doing research coming up, better ways to generate search queries from the questions, better ways to analyze the question, better ways to generate candidates."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And speed, so better is accuracy and speed."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "Correct, so right, speed and accuracy for the most part were separated."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "We handle that sort of in separate ways."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "Like I focus purely on accuracy, end to end accuracy."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "Are we ultimately getting more questions and producing more accurate confidences?"}, {"time": 4548, "text": "And then a whole nother team that was constantly analyzing the workflow to find the bottlenecks."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "And then figuring out how to both parallelize and drive the algorithm speed."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "But anyway, so now think of it like, you have this big fan out now, right?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Because you had multiple queries, now you have thousands of candidate answers."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "For each candidate answer, you're gonna score it."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So you're gonna use all the data that built up."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "You're gonna use the question analysis, you're gonna use how the query was generated, you're gonna use the passage itself, and you're gonna use the candidate answer that was generated, and you're gonna score that."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "So now we have a group of researchers coming up with scores."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "There are hundreds of different scores."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "So now you're getting a fan out of it again from however many candidate answers you have to all the different scores."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "So if you have 200 different scores and you have a thousand candidates, now you have 200,000 scores."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "And so now you gotta figure out, how do I now rank these answers based on the scores that came back?"}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And I wanna rank them based on the likelihood that they're a correct answer to the question."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "So every scorer was its own research project."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "What do you mean by scorer?"}, {"time": 4622, "text": "So is that the annotation process of basically a human being saying that this answer has a quality of?"}, {"time": 4654, "text": "So that's the annotation task."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "That's the annotation process."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "That's the scoring task."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "But scoring implies zero to one kind of continuous."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "You give it a zero to one score."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "So it's not a binary."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "No, you give it a score."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "Give it a zero to, yeah, exactly, zero to one score."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "But humans give different scores, so you have to somehow normalize and all that kind of stuff that deal with all that complexity."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "It depends on what your strategy is."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "We both, we..."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "It could be relative, too."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "It could be... We actually looked at the raw scores as well as standardized scores, because humans are not involved in this."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "Humans are not involved."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Sorry, so I'm misunderstanding the process here."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "This is passages."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "Where is the ground truth coming from?"}, {"time": 4693, "text": "Ground truth is only the answers to the questions."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "So it's end to end."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's end to end."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "So I was always driving end to end performance."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "It's a very interesting, a very interesting engineering approach, and ultimately scientific research approach, always driving end to end."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Now, that's not to say we wouldn't make hypotheses that individual component performance was related in some way to end to end performance."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "Of course we would, because people would have to build individual components."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "But ultimately, to get your component integrated to the system, you have to show impact on end to end performance, question answering performance."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "So there's many very smart people working on this, and they're basically trying to sell their ideas as a component that should be part of the system."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "And they would do research on their component, and they would say things like, I'm gonna improve this as a candidate generator, or I'm gonna improve this as a question score, or as a passive scorer, I'm gonna improve this, or as a parser, and I can improve it by 2% on its component metric, like a better parse, or a better candidate, or a better type estimation, whatever it is."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "And then I would say, I need to understand how the improvement on that component metric is gonna affect the end to end performance."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "If you can't estimate that, and can't do experiments to demonstrate that, it doesn't get in."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "That's like the best run AI project I've ever heard."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "Okay, what breakthrough would you say, like, I'm sure there's a lot of day to day breakthroughs, but was there like a breakthrough that really helped improve performance?"}, {"time": 4797, "text": "Like where people began to believe, or is it just a gradual process?"}, {"time": 4802, "text": "Well, I think it was a gradual process, but one of the things that I think gave people confidence that we can get there was that, as we follow this procedure of different ideas, build different components, plug them into the architecture, run the system, see how we do, do the error analysis, start off new research projects to improve things."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "And the very important idea that the individual component work did not have to deeply understand everything that was going on with every other component."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "And this is where we leverage machine learning in a very important way."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "So while individual components could be statistically driven machine learning components, some of them were heuristic, some of them were machine learning components, the system has a whole combined all the scores using machine learning."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "This was critical because that way you can divide and conquer."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "So you can say, okay, you work on your candidate generator, or you work on this approach to answer scoring, you work on this approach to type scoring, you work on this approach to passage search or to pass a selection and so forth."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "But when we just plug it in, and we had enough training data to say, now we can train and figure out how do we weigh all the scores relative to each other based on the predicting the outcome, which is right or wrong on Jeopardy."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "And we had enough training data to do that."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "So this enabled people to work independently and to let the machine learning do the integration."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "Beautiful, so yeah, the machine learning is doing the fusion, and then it's a human orchestrated ensemble of different approaches."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "Still impressive that you were able to get it done in a few years."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "That's not obvious to me that it's doable, if I just put myself in that mindset."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "But when you look back at the Jeopardy challenge, again, when you're looking up at the stars, what are you most proud of, looking back at those days?"}, {"time": 4937, "text": "I'm most proud of my, my commitment and my team's commitment to be true to the science, to not be afraid to fail."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "That's beautiful because there's so much pressure, because it is a public event, it is a public show, that you were dedicated to the idea."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "Do you think it was a success?"}, {"time": 4973, "text": "In the eyes of the world, it was a success."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "By your, I'm sure, exceptionally high standards, is there something you regret you would do differently?"}, {"time": 4983, "text": "It was a success."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "It was a success for our goal."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "Our goal was to build the most advanced open domain question answering system."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "We went back to the old problems that we used to try to solve, and we did dramatically better on all of them, as well as we beat Jeopardy."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "So we won at Jeopardy."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So it was a success."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "It was, I worry that the community or the world would not understand it as a success because it came down to only one game."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "And I knew statistically speaking, this can be a huge technical success, and we could still lose that one game."}, {"time": 5023, "text": "And that's a whole nother theme of this, of the journey."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "But it was a success."},

in terms of the science, but I would argue that the inspiration of it, right?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "The, not a success in terms of solving natural language understanding."}, {"time": 5052,

being compete in Jeopardy and how Watson does it?"}, {"time": 5066, "text": "That's important in terms of intelligence."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "Yeah, so that actually came up very early on in the project also."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "In fact, I had people who wanted to be on the project who were early on, who sort of approached me once I committed to do it, had wanted to think about how humans do it."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And they were, from a cognition perspective, like human cognition and how that should play."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "And I would not take them on the project

care."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "So it wasn't that I didn't care in general."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "In fact, as an AI scientist, I care a lot about that, but I'm also a practical engineer and I committed to getting this thing done and I wasn't gonna get distracted."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "I had to kind of say, like, if I'm gonna get this done, I'm gonna chart this path."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "And this path says, we're gonna engineer a machine that's gonna get this thing done."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And we know what search and NLP can do."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "We have to build on that foundation."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "If I come in and take a different approach and start wondering about how the human mind might or might not do this, I'm not gonna get there from here in the timeframe."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "I think that's a great way to lead the team."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "But now that it's done and there's one, when you look back, analyze what's the difference actually."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "So I was a little bit surprised actually to discover over time, as this would come up from time to time and we'd reflect on it, and talking to Ken

5184, "text": "Because humans are probably in the game of Jeopardy!"}, {"time": 5187, "text": "at the level of Ken Jennings, are probably also cheating their way to winning, right?"}, {"time": 5195, "text": "Not cheating, but shallow."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "Well, they're doing shallow analysis."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "They're doing the fastest possible."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "They're doing shallow analysis."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "So they are very quickly analyzing the question and coming up with some key vectors or cues, if you will."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "And they're taking those cues and they're very quickly going through like their library of stuff, not deeply reasoning about what's going on."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "And then sort of like a lots of different, like what we would call these scores, would kind of score that in a very shallow way and then say, oh, boom, you know, that's what it is."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And so it's interesting as we reflected on that."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "So we may be doing something that's not too far off from the way humans do it, but we certainly didn't approach it by saying, how would a human do this?"}, {"time": 5242, "text": "Now in elemental cognition, like the project I'm leading now, we ask those questions all the time because ultimately we're trying to do something that is to make the intelligence of the machine and the intelligence of the human very compatible."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "Well, compatible in the sense they can communicate with one another and they can reason with this shared understanding."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "So how they think about things and how they build answers, how they build explanations becomes a very important question to consider."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "So what's the difference between this open domain, but cold constructed question answering of Jeopardy and more something that requires understanding for shared communication with humans and machines?"}, {"time": 5290, "text": "Yeah, well, this goes back to the interpretation of what we were talking about before."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "Jeopardy, the system's not trying to interpret the question and it's not interpreting the content it's reusing with regard to any particular framework."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "I mean, it is parsing it and parsing the content and using grammatical cues and stuff like that."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "So if you think of grammar as a human framework in some sense, it has that, but when you get into the richer semantic frameworks, what do people, how do they think, what motivates them, what are the events that are occurring and why are they occurring and what causes what else to happen and where are things in time and space?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "And like when you start thinking about how humans formulate and structure the knowledge that they acquire in their head and wasn't doing any of that."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "What do you think are the essential challenges of like free flowing communication, free flowing dialogue versus question answering even with the framework of the interpretation dialogue?"}, {"time": 5352, "text": "Do you see free flowing dialogue as a fundamentally more difficult than question answering even with shared interpretation?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "So dialogue is important in a number of different ways."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "I mean, it's a challenge."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "So in some sense it needs to dialogue."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "That doesn't mean that it, sometimes people talk about dialogue and they think, you know, how do humans talk to like, talk to each other in a casual conversation and you can mimic casual conversations."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "We're not trying to mimic casual conversations."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "We're really trying to produce a machine whose goal is to help you think and help you reason about your answers and explain why."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "So instead of like talking to your friend down the street about having a small talk conversation with your friend down the street, this is more about like you would be communicating to the computer on Star Trek where like, what do you wanna think about?"}, {"time": 5436, "text": "Like, what do you wanna reason about?"}, {"time": 5437, "text": "I'm gonna tell you the information I have."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "I'm gonna have to summarize it."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "I'm gonna ask you questions."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "You're gonna answer those

that to the information I have and present it to you in a way that you can understand it and then we could ask followup questions."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So it's that type of dialogue that you wanna construct."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "It's more structured, it's more goal oriented, but it needs to be fluid."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "In other words, it has to be engaging and fluid."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "It has to be productive and not distracting."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "So there has to be a model of, in other words, the machine has to have a model of how humans think through things and discuss them."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "So basically a productive, rich conversation unlike this podcast."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "I'd like to think it's more similar to this podcast."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "I wasn't joking."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "I'll ask you about humor as well, actually."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "But what's the hardest part of that?"}, {"time": 5503, "text": "Because it seems we're quite far away as a community from that still to be able to, so one is having a shared understanding."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "That's, I think, a lot of the stuff you said with frameworks is quite brilliant."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "But just creating a smooth discourse."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "It feels clunky right now."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "Which aspects of this whole problem that you just specified of having a productive conversation is the hardest?"}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And that we're, or maybe any aspect of it you can comment on because it's so shrouded in mystery."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "So I think to do this you kind of have to be creative in the following sense."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "If I were to do this as purely a machine learning approach and someone said learn how to have a good, fluent, structured knowledge acquisition conversation, I'd go out and say, okay, I have to collect a bunch of data of people doing that."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "People reasoning well, having a good, structured conversation that both acquires knowledge efficiently as well as produces answers and explanations as part of the process."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "And you struggle."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "To collect the data."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "To collect the data because I don't know how much data is like that."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Okay, there's one, there's a humorous commentary on the lack of rational discourse."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "But also even if it's out there, say it was out there, how do you actually annotate, like how do you collect an accessible example?"}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Right, so I think any problem like this where you don't have enough data to represent the phenomenon you want to learn, in other words you want, if you have enough data you could potentially learn the pattern."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "In an example like this it's hard to do."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "This is sort of a human sort of thing to do."}, {"time": 5614, "text": "What recently came out at IBM was the debater projects and it's interesting, right, because now you do have these structured dialogues, these debate things where they did use machine learning techniques to generate these debates."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "Dialogues are a little bit tougher in my opinion than generating a structured argument where you have lots of other structured arguments like this, you could potentially annotate that data and you could say this is a good response, this is a bad response in a particular domain."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "Here I have to be responsive and I have to be opportunistic with regard to what is the human saying."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So I'm goal oriented in saying I want to solve the problem, I want to acquire the knowledge necessary, but I also have to be opportunistic and responsive to what the human is saying."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "So I think that it's not clear that we could just train on the body of data to do this, but we could bootstrap it."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "In other words, we can be creative and we could say, what do we think the structure of a good dialogue is that does this well?"}, {"time": 5675, "text": "And we can start to create that."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "If we can create that more programmatically, at least to get this process started and I can create a tool that now engages humans effectively, I could start generating data, I could start the human learning process and I can update my machine, but I could also start the automatic learning process as well, but I have to understand what features to even learn over."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "So I have to bootstrap the process a little bit first."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "And that's a creative design task that I could then use as input into a more automatic learning task."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "So some creativity in bootstrapping."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "What elements of a conversation do you think you would like to see?"}, {"time": 5721, "text": "So one of the benchmarks for me is humor, right?"}, {"time": 5725, "text": "That seems to be one of the hardest."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "And to me, the biggest contrast is sort of Watson."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "So one of the greatest sketches, comedy sketches of all time, right, is the SNL celebrity Jeopardy with Alex Trebek and Sean Connery and Burt Reynolds and so on, with Sean Connery commentating on Alex Trebek's while they're alive."}, {"time": 5749, "text": "And I think all of them are in the negative pointwise."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "So they're clearly all losing in terms of the game of Jeopardy, but they're winning in terms of comedy."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "So what do you think about humor in this whole interaction in the dialogue that's productive?"}, {"time": 5766, "text": "Or even just what humor represents to me is the same idea that you're saying about framework, because humor only exists within a particular human framework."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "So what do you think about humor?"}, {"time": 5779, "text": "What do you think about things like humor that connect to the kind of creativity you mentioned that's needed?"}, {"time": 5785, "text": "I think there's a couple of things going on there."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "So I sort of feel like, and I might be too optimistic this way, but I think that there are, we did a little bit about with puns in Jeopardy."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "We literally sat down and said, how do puns work?"}, {"time": 5803, "text": "And it's like wordplay, and you could formalize these things."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "So I think there's a lot aspects of humor that you could formalize."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "You could also learn humor."}, {"time": 5811, "text": "You could just say, what do people laugh at?"}, {"time": 5813, "text": "And if you have enough, again, if you have enough data to represent the phenomenon, you might be able to weigh the features and figure out what humans find funny and what they don't find funny."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "The machine might not be able to explain why the human is funny unless we sit back and think about that more formally."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "I think, again, I think you do a combination of both."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "And I'm always a big proponent of that."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "I think robust architectures and approaches are always a little bit combination of us reflecting and being creative about how things are structured, how to formalize them, and then taking advantage of large data and doing learning and figuring out how to combine these two approaches."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "I think there's another aspect to humor though, which goes to the idea that I feel like I can relate to the person telling the story."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "And I think that's an interesting theme in the whole AI theme, which is, do I feel differently when I know it's a robot?"}, {"time": 5868, "text": "And when I imagine that the robot is not conscious the way I'm conscious, when I imagine the robot does not actually have the experiences that I experience, do I find it funny?"}, {"time": 5880, "text": "Or do, because it's not as related, I don't imagine that the person's relating it to it the way I relate to it."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "I think this also, you see this in the arts and in entertainment where, sometimes you have savants who are remarkable at a thing, whether it's sculpture or it's music or whatever, but the people who get the most attention are the people who can evoke a similar emotional response, who can get you to emote, right?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "About the way they are."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "In other words, who can basically make the connection from the artifact, from the music or the painting of the sculpture to the emotion and get you to share that emotion with them."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "And then, and that's when it becomes compelling."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "So they're communicating at a whole different level."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "They're just not communicating the artifact."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "They're communicating their emotional response to the artifact."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "And then you feel like, oh wow, I can relate to that person, I can connect to that, I can connect to that person."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "So I think humor has that aspect as well."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "So the idea that you can connect to that person, person being the critical thing, but we're also able to anthropomorphize objects pretty, robots and AI systems pretty well."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "So we're almost looking to make them human."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "So maybe from your experience with Watson, maybe you can comment on, did you consider that as part, well, obviously the problem of jeopardy doesn't require anthropomorphization, but nevertheless."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "Well, there was some interest in doing that."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "And that's another thing I didn't want to do because I didn't want to distract from the actual scientific task."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "I mean, humans do anthropomorphize and without necessarily a lot of work."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "I mean, you just put some eyes and a couple of eyebrow movements and you're getting humans to react emotionally."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "And I think you can do that."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "So I didn't mean to suggest that, that that connection cannot be mimicked."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "I think that connection can be mimicked and can produce that emotional response."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "I just wonder though, if you're told what's really going on, if you know that the machine is not conscious, not having the same richness of emotional reactions and understanding that it doesn't really share the understanding, but it's essentially just moving its eyebrow or drooping its eyes or making them bigger, whatever it's doing, just getting the emotional response, will you still feel it?"}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I think you probably would for a while."}, {"time": 6034, "text": "And then when it becomes more important that there's a deeper share of understanding, it may run flat, but I don't know."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "I'm pretty confident that majority of the world, even if you tell them how it works, well, it will not matter, especially if the machine herself says that she is conscious."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "That's very possible."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "So you, the scientist that made the machine is saying that this is how the algorithm works."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Everybody will just assume you're lying and that there's a conscious being there."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So you're deep into the science fiction genre now, but yeah."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "I don't think it's, it's actually psychology."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "I think it's not science fiction."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "I think it's reality."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "I think it's a really powerful one that we'll have to be exploring in the next few decades."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "It's a very interesting element of intelligence."}, {"time": 6083, "text": "So what do you think, we've talked about social constructs of intelligences and frameworks and the way humans kind of interpret information."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "So there's the Alan Turing with the Turing test."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Watson accomplished something very impressive with Jeopardy."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "What do you think is a test that would impress the heck out of you that you saw that a computer could do?"}, {"time": 6112, "text": "They would say, this is crossing a kind of threshold that gives me pause in a good way."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "My expectations for AI are generally high."}, {"time": 6126, "text": "What does high look like by the way?"}, {"time": 6127, "text": "So not the threshold, test is a threshold."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "What do you think is the destination?"}, {"time": 6132, "text": "What do you think is the ceiling?"}, {"time": 6135, "text": "I think machines will in many measures will be better than us, will become more effective."},

before, which is relating to communicating with and understanding humans in deeper ways."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "And so I think that's a key point, like we can create the super parrot."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "What I mean by the super parrot is given enough data, a machine can mimic your emotional response, can even generate language that will sound smart and what someone else might say under similar circumstances."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "Like I would just pause on that, like that's the super parrot, right?"}, {"time": 6181, "text": "So given similar circumstances, moves its faces in similar ways, changes its tone of voice in similar ways, produces strings of language that would similar that a human might say, not necessarily being able to produce a logical interpretation or understanding that would ultimately satisfy a critical interrogation or a critical understanding."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "I think you just described me in a nutshell."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "So I think philosophically speaking, you could argue that that's all we're doing as human beings to work super parrots."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "So I was gonna say, it's very possible, you know, humans do behave that way too."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "And so upon deeper probing and deeper interrogation, you may find out that there isn't a shared understanding because I think humans do both."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "Like humans are statistical language model machines and they are capable reasoners."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "You know, they're both."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "And you don't know which is going on, right?"}, {"time": 6242, "text": "So, and I think it's an interesting problem."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "We talked earlier about like where we are in our social and political landscape."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "Can you distinguish someone who can string words together and sound like they know what they're talking about from someone who actually does?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Can you do that without dialogue, without interrogative or probing dialogue?"}, {"time": 6267, "text": "So it's interesting because humans are really good in their own mind, justifying or explaining what they hear because they project their understanding onto yours."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "So you could say, you could put together a string of words and someone will sit there and interpret it in a way that's extremely biased to the way they wanna interpret it."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "They wanna assume that you're an idiot and they'll interpret it one way."}, {"time": 6290, "text": "They will assume you're a genius and they'll interpret it another way that suits their needs."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "So this is tricky business."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So I think to answer your question, as AI gets better and better, better and better mimic, you recreate the super parrots, we're challenged just as we are with, we're challenged with humans."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "Do you really know what you're talking about?"}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Do you have a meaningful interpretation, a powerful framework that you could reason over and justify your answers,

intelligently and make me believe that the implications of your prediction and so forth?"}, {"time": 6340, "text": "So what happens is it becomes reflective."}, {"time": 6344, "text": "My standard for judging your intelligence depends a lot on mine."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "But you're saying there should be a large group of people with a certain standard of intelligence that would be convinced by this particular AI system."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "Then they'll pass."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "There should be, but I think depending on the content, one of the problems we have there is that if that large community of people are not judging it with regard to a rigorous standard of objective logic and reason, you still have a problem."}, {"time": 6379, "text": "Like masses of people can be

about AlphaZero, OpenAI5, AlphaStar accomplishments on video games recently, which are also, I think, at least in the case of Go, with AlphaGo and AlphaZero playing Go, was a monumental accomplishment

cool."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "I mean, it's very interesting what they did."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "And I loved how they solved the data problem, which again, they bootstrapped it and got the

8092, "text": "So machines don't have this as the input data and they don't have the feedback that says, I've gotten this emotion or I've gotten this idea, I now want to process it, and then it then

think, do we want a human intelligence?"}, {"time": 8130, "text": "Well, if we want a human compatible intelligence, probably the best thing to do is to embed it in a human body."}, {"time": 8136,

really embedding intelligence systems to ride along human bodies?"}, {"time": 8159, "text": "No, I mean riding along is different."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "I meant like if you want to create an intelligence that is human compatible, meaning that it can learn and develop a shared understanding of the world around it, you have to give it a lot of the same substrate."}, {"time": 8175, "text":

senses, right?"}, {"time": 8188, "text": "So I think if you want that, again, I don't know that you want that."}, {"time": 8192, "text": "That's not my specific goal, I think that's a fascinating

there are things to worry about."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "I think giving machines too much leverage is a problem."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "And what I mean by leverage is, is too much control over

streets, that's gonna be the big issue."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And it's just because you can't possibly, I wanna say you can't possibly map the, some of the silliness of human drivers, right?"},

like go around."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Like we are, we know that that person is just gonna make mistakes that make no sense, right?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "How do you map that information?"},

that's an issue, right?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "So how do you get that kind of information and that experience into basically an autopilot?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "And there's millions of cases like that where we take little hints to establish context."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "I mean, you said kind of beautifully poetic human things, but there's probably subtle things about the environment

on."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "Or even cities, right?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Like if you're in Boston, how people cross the street, like lights are not an issue versus other places where people

robot?"}, {"time": 1076, "text": "Is there something that could be done, you think, that, you know, that's what we humans do."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "It's just like bird flight, right?"}, {"time":

shortcut to it?"}, {"time": 1093, "text": "So I think the shortcut is, and I kind of, I talk about it as a fixed space, where, so imagine that there's a neighborhood that's a new smart city or a new neighborhood that says, you know what?"}, {"time": 1107, "text": "We are going to design this new city based on supporting self driving cars."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And then doing things, knowing that there's anomalies, knowing that people are like this, right?"}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And designing it based on that assumption that like, we're gonna have this."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "That would be an example of a shortcut."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So you still have people, but you do very specific things to try to minimize the noise a little bit as an example."}, {"time": 1133,

have a self selection bias, right?"}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Like individuals will move into this neighborhood knowing like this is part of like the real estate pitch, right?"}, {"time": 1150,

happen because things do, because you already have the self selection, like people would be, I think a little more forgiving than other places."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And you said three things,

out of time now."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Do you think from a robotics perspective, you know, if you're kind of honest of what cars do, they kind of threaten each other's life all the time."},

talk about it, but usually it's kind of, it's like a very particular group of people that work on that."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And then people who do like robotics are like, well, I don't have to think about that."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "There's other smart people thinking about it."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "It seems that everybody has to think about it."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "It's not, you can't escape the ethics, whether it's bias or just every aspect of ethics that has to do with human beings."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Everyone."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "So think about, I'm gonna age myself, but I remember when we didn't have like testers, right?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And so what did you do?"}, {"time": 1411, "text": "As a developer, you had to test your own code, right?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Like you had to go through all the cases and figure it out and then they realized that, we probably need to have testing because we're not getting all the things."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And so from there, what happens is like most developers, they do a little bit of testing, but it's usually like, okay, did my compiler bug out?"}, {"time": 1429, "text": "Let me look at the warnings."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "Okay, is that acceptable or not, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Like that's how you typically think about as a developer and you'll just assume that it's going to go to another process and they're gonna test it out."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "But I think we need to go back to those early days when you're a developer, you're developing, there should be like the say, okay, let me look at the ethical outcomes of this because there isn't a second like testing ethical testers, right, it's you."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "We did it back in the early coding days."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "I think that's where we are with respect to ethics."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Like let's go back to what was good practices and only because we were just developing the field."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Yeah, and it's a really heavy burden."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "I've had to feel it recently in the last few months, but I think it's a good one to feel like I've gotten a message, more than one from people."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "You know, I've unfortunately gotten some attention recently and I've gotten messages that say that I have blood on my hands because of working on semi autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So the idea that you have semi autonomy means people will become, will lose vigilance and so on."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "That's actually be humans, as we described."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And because of that, because of this idea that we're creating automation, there'll be people be hurt because of it."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And I think that's a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "I mean, it's, you know, there's many nights where I wasn't able to sleep because of this notion."},

know what, 40,000 people die in the United States every year and we're trying to ultimately try to save lives."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "But the reality is your code you've written might kill somebody."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And that's an important burden to carry with you as you design the code."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "I don't even think of it as a burden if we train this concept

there might be a possibility that this patient might not survive."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And so when they approach every decision, like that's in the back of their head."}, {"time": 1571, "text":

if we just change the messaging a little, great gift, being a developer, great responsibility."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And this is how you combine those."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "But do you think, I mean, this is really interesting."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "It's outside, I actually have no friends who are sort of surgeons or doctors."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "I mean, what does it feel like to make a mistake in a surgery and somebody to die because of that?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "Like, is that something you could be taught in medical school, sort of how to be accepting of that risk?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So, because I do a lot of work with healthcare robotics, I have not lost a patient, for example."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "The first one's always the hardest, right?"}, {"time": 1640, "text": "But they really teach the value, right?"}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So, they teach responsibility, but they also teach the value."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "Like, you're saving 40,000, but in order to really feel good about that, when you come to a decision, you have to be able to say at the end, I did all that I could possibly do, right?"}, {"time": 1665,

design to what you're used to."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "Oh, this fits all the folks in my lab, right?"}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So, think about it from the very beginning is important."}, {"time":

you?"}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Yeah, so you actually said something."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "You had said how we have biases, but hopefully we learn from them and we become better, right?"},

that's totally a clickbait title."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "And so you looked at it and so there was data that these researchers had collected."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "I believe, I wanna say it was either Science or Nature."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "It just was just published, but they didn't have a sensational title."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "It was like the media."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "And so they had looked at demographics, I believe, between black and white women, right?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And they showed that there was a discrepancy in the outcomes, right?"},

{"time": 2108, "text": "I mean, the journalists with AI are problematic across the board, let's say."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "And so this is a problem, right?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And so there's this thing about, oh, AI, it has all these problems."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "We're doing it on historical data and the outcomes are uneven based on gender or ethnicity or age."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "But I am always saying is like, yes, we need to do better, right?"}, {"time": 2132, "text": "We need to do better."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "It is our duty to do better."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "But the worst AI is still better than us."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Like, you take the best of us and we're still worse than the worst AI, at least in terms of these things."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "And that's actually not discussed, right?"}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And so I think, and that's why the sensational title, right?"}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And so it's like, so then you can have individuals go like, oh, we don't need to use this AI."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "I want the AI instead of the doctors that provided that data, because it's still better than that, right?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "I think that's really important to linger on, is the idea that this AI is racist."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "It's like, well, compared to what?"}, {"time": 2174, "text": "Sort of, I think we set, unfortunately, way too high of a bar for AI algorithms."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "And in the ethical space where perfect is, I would argue, probably impossible."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "Then if we set the bar of perfection, essentially, of it has to be perfectly fair, whatever that means, it means we're setting it up for failure."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "But that's really important to say what you just said, which is, well, it's still better than it is."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And one of the things I think that we don't get enough credit for, just in terms of as developers, is that you can now poke at it, right?"}, {"time": 2215, "text": "So it's harder to say, is this hospital, is this city doing something, right?"}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Until someone brings in a civil case, right?"}, {"time": 2224, "text": "Well, with AI, it can process through all this data and say, hey, yes, there was an issue here, but here it is, we've identified it, and then the next step is to fix it."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "I mean, that's a nice feedback loop versus waiting for someone to sue someone else before it's fixed, right?"}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And so I think that power, we need to capitalize on a little bit more, right?"}, {"time": 2247, "text": "Instead of having the sensational titles, have the, okay, this is a problem, and this is how we're fixing it, and people are putting money to fix it because we can make it better."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "I look at like facial recognition, how Joy, she basically called out a couple of companies and said, hey, and most of them were like, oh, embarrassment, and the next time it had been fixed, right, it had been fixed better, right?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "And then it was like, oh, here's some more issues."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And I think that conversation then moves that needle to having much more fair and unbiased and ethical aspects, as long as both sides, the developers are willing to say, okay, I hear you, yes, we are going to improve, and you have other developers who are like, hey, AI, it's wrong, but I love it, right?"}, {"time": 2299, "text": "Yes, so speaking of this really nice notion that AI is maybe flawed but better than humans, so just made me think of it, one example of flawed humans is our political system."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "Do you think, or you said judicial as well, do you have a hope for AI sort of being elected for president or running our Congress or being able to be a powerful representative of the people?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "So I mentioned, and I truly believe that this whole world of AI is in partnerships with people."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "And so what does that mean?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "I don't believe, or maybe I just don't, I don't believe that we should have an AI for president, but I do believe that a president should use AI as an advisor, right?"}, {"time": 2355, "text": "Like, if you think about it, every president has a cabinet of individuals that have different expertise that they should listen to, right?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Like, that's kind of what we do."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And you put smart people with smart expertise around certain issues, and you listen."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "I don't see why AI can't function as one of those smart individuals giving input."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "So maybe there's an AI on healthcare, maybe there's an AI on education and right, like all of these things that a human is processing, right?"}, {"time": 2388, "text": "Because at the end of the day, there's people that are human that are going to be at the end of the decision."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "And I don't think as a world, as a culture, as a society, that we would totally, and this is us, like this is some fallacy about us, but we need to see that leader, that person as human."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And most people don't realize that like leaders have a whole lot of advice, right?"}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Like when they say something, it's not that they woke up, well, usually they don't wake up in the morning and be like, I have a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 2424, "text": "It's usually a, okay, let me listen."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "I have a brilliant idea, but let me get a little bit of feedback on this."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And then it's a, yeah, that was an awesome idea or it's like, yeah, let me go back."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "We already talked through a bunch of them, but are there some possible solutions to the bias that's present in our algorithms beyond what we just talked about?"}, {"time": 2446, "text": "So I think there's two paths."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "One is to figure out how to systematically do the feedback and corrections."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "So right now it's ad hoc, right?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "It's a researcher identify some outcomes that are not, don't seem to be fair, right?"}, {"time": 2465, "text": "They publish it, they write about it."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And the, either the developer or the companies that have adopted the algorithms may try to fix it, right?"}, {"time": 2474, "text": "And so it's really ad hoc and it's not systematic."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "There's, it's just, it's kind of like, I'm a researcher, that seems like an interesting problem, which means that there's a whole lot out there that's not being looked at, right?"}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Cause it's kind of researcher driven."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "And I don't necessarily have a solution, but that process I think could be done a little bit better."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "One way is I'm going to poke a little bit at some of the corporations, right?"}, {"time": 2508, "text": "Like maybe the corporations when they think about a product, they should, instead of, in addition to hiring these, you know, bug, they give these."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "Like awards when you find a bug."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "Yeah, security bug, you know, let's put it like we will give the, whatever the award is that we give for the people who find these security holes, find an ethics hole, right?"}, {"time": 2533, "text": "Like find an unfairness hole and we will pay you X for each one you find."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "I mean, why can't they do that?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "One is a win win."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "They show that they're concerned about it, that this is important and they don't have to necessarily dedicate it their own like internal resources."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And it also means that everyone who has like their own bias lens, like I'm interested in age."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And so I'll find the ones based on age and I'm interested in gender and right, which means that you get like all of these different perspectives."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "But you think of it in a data driven way."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "So like sort of, if we look at a company like Twitter, it gets, it's under a lot of fire for discriminating against certain political beliefs."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And sort of, there's a lot of people, this is the sad thing, cause I know how hard the problem is and I know the Twitter folks are working really hard at it."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Even Facebook that everyone seems to hate are working really hard at this."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "You know, the kind of evidence that people bring is basically anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Well, me or my friend, all we said is X and for that we got banned."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "And that's kind of a discussion of saying, well, look, that's usually, first of all, the whole thing is taken out of context."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So they present sort of anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And how are you supposed to, as a company, in a healthy way, have a discourse about what is and isn't ethical?"}, {"time": 2615, "text": "How do we make algorithms ethical when people are just blowing everything?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "Like they're outraged about a particular anecdotal piece of evidence that's very difficult to sort of contextualize in the big data driven way."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Do you have a hope for companies like Twitter and Facebook?"}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on, right?"}, {"time": 2639, "text": "First off, remember this whole aspect of we are becoming reliant on technology."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "We're also becoming reliant on a lot of these, the apps and the resources that are provided, right?"}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So some of it is kind of anger, like I need you, right?"}, {"time": 2661, "text": "And you're not working for me, right?"}, {"time":

also met adults, right?"}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And so that is a developmental process."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "And I'm sure there's a bunch of psychologists that can go through, like you can have a 60 year old adult who has the emotional maturity of a 10 year old, right?"}, {"time": 3424, "text": "And so there's various phases that people should go through in order to evolve and sometimes you don't."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "So how much psychology do you think, a topic that's rarely mentioned in robotics, but how much does psychology come to play when you're talking about HRI, human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 3443, "text": "When you have to have robots that actually interact with humans."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So we, like my group, as well as I read a lot in the cognitive science literature, as well as the psychology literature."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Because they understand a lot about human, human relations and developmental milestones and things like that."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And so we tend to look to see what's been done out there."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Sometimes what we'll do is we'll try to match that to see, is that human, human relationship the same as human robot?"}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Sometimes it is, and sometimes it's different."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "And then when it's different, we have to, we try to figure out, okay, why is it different in this scenario?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "But it's the same in the other scenario, right?"}, {"time": 3491, "text": "And so we try to do that quite a bit."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Would you say that's, if we're looking at the future of human robot interaction, would you say the psychology piece is the hardest?"}, {"time": 3502, "text": "Like if, I mean, it's a funny notion for you as, I don't know if you consider, yeah."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "I mean, one way to ask it, do you consider yourself a roboticist or a psychologist?"}, {"time": 3512, "text": "Oh, I consider myself a roboticist that plays the act of a psychologist."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "But if you were to look at yourself sort of, 20, 30 years from now, do you see yourself more and more wearing the psychology hat?"}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Another way to put it is, are the hard problems in human robot interactions fundamentally psychology, or is it still robotics, the perception manipulation, planning, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 3539, "text": "It's actually neither."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "The hardest part is the adaptation and the interaction."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "So it's the interface, it's the learning."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "And so if I think of, like I've become much more of a roboticist slash AI person than when I, like originally, again, I was about the bionics."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "I was electrical engineer, I was control theory, right?"}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And then I started realizing that my algorithms needed like human data, right?"}, {"time": 3570, "text": "And so then I was like, okay, what is this human thing?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "How do I incorporate human data?"}, {"time": 3574, "text": "And then I realized that human perception had, like there was a lot in terms of how we perceive the world."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "And so trying to figure out how do I model human perception for my, and so I became a HRI person, human robot interaction person, from being a control theory and realizing that humans actually offered quite a bit."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "And then when you do that, you become more of an artificial intelligence, AI."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "And so I see myself evolving more in this AI world under the lens of robotics, having hardware, interacting with people."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "So you're a world class expert researcher in robotics, and yet others, you know, there's a few, it's a small but fierce community of people, but most of them don't take the journey into the H of HRI, into the human."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "So why did you brave into the interaction with humans?"}, {"time": 3634, "text": "It seems like a really hard problem."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "It's a hard problem, and it's very risky as an academic."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "And I knew that when I started down that journey, that it was very risky as an academic in this world that was nuance, it was just developing."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "We didn't even have a conference, right, at the time."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "Because it was the interesting problems."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "That was what drove me."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "It was the fact that I looked at what interests me in terms of the application space and the problems."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And that pushed me into trying to figure out what people were and what humans were and how to adapt to them."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "If those problems weren't so interesting, I'd probably still be sending rovers to glaciers, right?"}, {"time": 3686, "text": "But the problems were interesting."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And the other thing was that they were hard, right?"}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So it's, I like having to go into a room and being like, I don't know what to do."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "And then going back and saying, okay, I'm gonna figure this out."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "I do not, I'm not driven when I go in like, oh, there are no surprises."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "Like, I don't find that satisfying."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "If that was the case, I'd go someplace and make a lot more money, right?"}, {"time": 3711, "text": "I think I stay in academic because and choose to do this because I can go into a room and like, that's hard."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "Yeah, I think just from my perspective, maybe you can correct me on it, but if I just look at the field of AI broadly, it seems that human robot interaction has the most, one of the most number of open problems."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "Like people, especially relative to how many people are willing to acknowledge that there are this, because most people are just afraid of the humans so they don't even acknowledge how many open problems there are."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "But it's in terms of difficult problems to solve exciting spaces, it seems to be incredible for that."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "It is, and it's exciting."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "You've mentioned trust before."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "What role does trust from interacting with autopilot to in the medical context, what role does trust play in the human robot interactions?"}, {"time": 3771, "text": "So some of the things I study in this domain is not just trust, but it really is over trust."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "How do you think about over trust?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Like what is, first of all, what is trust and what is over trust?"}, {"time": 3783, "text": "Basically, the way I look at it is, trust is not what you click on a survey, trust is about your behavior."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "So if you interact with the technology based on the decision or the actions of the technology as if you trust that decision, then you're trusting."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "And even in my group, we've done surveys that on the thing, do you trust robots?"}, {"time": 3809, "text": "Would you follow this robot in a burdening building?"}, {"time": 3812, "text": "And then you look at their actions and you're like, clearly your behavior does not match what you think or what you think you would like to think."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "And so I'm really concerned about the behavior because that's really at the end of the day, when you're in the world, that's what will impact others around you."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "It's not whether before you went onto the street, you clicked on like, I don't trust self driving cars."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Yeah, that from an outsider perspective, it's always frustrating to me."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "Well, I read a lot, so I'm insider in a certain philosophical sense."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "It's frustrating to me how often trust is used in surveys and how people say, make claims out of any kind of finding they make while somebody clicking on answer."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "You just trust is a, yeah, behavior just, you said it beautifully."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "I mean, the action, your own behavior is what trust is."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "I mean, that everything else is not even close."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "It's almost like absurd comedic poetry that you weave around your actual behavior."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "So some people can say their trust, you know, I trust my wife, husband or not, whatever, but the actions is what speaks volumes."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "You bug their car, you probably don't trust them."},

case."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "I came here at some point, I'm sure, on either Uber or Lyft, right?"}, {"time": 3903, "text": "I remember when it first came out, right?"}, {"time": 3906, "text": "I bet if they had had a survey, would you get in the car with a stranger and pay them?"}, {"time": 3912, "text": "How many people do you think would have said, like, really?"}, {"time": 3916, "text":

stupid."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And now look at where we are."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "I mean, people put kids, right?"}, {"time": 3933, "text": "Like, oh yeah, my child has to go to school and yeah, I'm gonna put my kid in this car with a stranger."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "I mean, it's just fascinating how, like, what we think we think is not necessarily matching our behavior."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Yeah, and certainly with robots, with autonomous vehicles and all the kinds of robots you work with, that's, it's, yeah, it's, the way you answer it, especially if you've never

play in the interaction, do you think?"}, {"time": 3974, "text": "Like, is it good to, is it good to trust a robot?"}, {"time": 3979, "text": "What does over trust mean?"}, {"time": 3981, "text": "Or is it, is it good to kind of how you feel about autopilot currently, which is like, from a roboticist's perspective, is like, oh, still very cautious?"}, {"time": 3991, "text": "Yeah, so this is still an open area of research, but basically what I would like in a perfect world is that people trust the technology when it's working 100%, and people will be hypersensitive and identify when it's

technology, with robotics is positive, it mitigates any risk, it correlates with like best outcomes, it means that I'm more likely to either not see it when it makes some mistakes or faults, or I'm more likely to forgive it."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And so this is a problem because technology is not 100% accurate, right?"}, {"time": 4052, "text": "It's not 100% accurate, although it may be perfect."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "How do you get that first moment right, do you think?"}, {"time": 4057, "text": "There's also an education about the capabilities and limitations of the system."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "Do you have a sense of how do you educate people correctly in that first interaction?"}, {"time": 4067, "text": "Again, this is an open ended problem."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "So one of the study that actually has given me some hope that I were trying to figure out how to put in robotics."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So there was a research study that it showed for medical AI systems, giving information to radiologists about, here you need to look at these areas on the X ray."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "What they found was that when the system provided one choice, there was this aspect of either no trust or over trust, right?"}, {"time": 4106, "text": "Like I don't believe it at all, or a yes, yes, yes, yes."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "And they would miss things, right?"}, {"time": 4116, "text": "Instead, when the system gave them multiple choices, like here are the three, even if it knew like, it had estimated that the top area you need to look at was some place on the X ray."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "If it gave like one plus others, the trust was maintained and the accuracy of the entire population increased, right?"}, {"time": 4143, "text": "So basically it was a, you're still trusting the system, but you're also putting in a little bit of like, your human expertise, like your human decision processing into the equation."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "So it helps to mitigate that over trust risk."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "Yeah, so there's a fascinating balance that the strike."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "Haven't figured out again, robotics is still an open research."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "This is exciting open area research, exactly."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "So what are some exciting applications of human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 4170, "text": "You started a company, maybe you can talk about the exciting efforts there, but in general also what other space can robots interact with humans and help?"}, {"time": 4181, "text": "Yeah, so besides healthcare, cause you know, that's my bias lens."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "My other bias lens is education."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "I think that, well, one, we definitely, we in the US, you know, we're doing okay with teachers, but there's a lot of school districts that don't have enough teachers."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "If you think about the teacher student ratio for at least public education in some districts, it's crazy."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "It's like, how can you have learning in that classroom, right?"}, {"time": 4210, "text": "Because you just don't have the human capital."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And so if you think about robotics, bringing that in to classrooms, as well as the afterschool space, where they offset some of this lack of resources in certain communities, I think that's a good place."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "And then turning on the other end is using these systems then for workforce retraining and dealing with some of the things that are going to come out later on of job loss, like thinking about robots and in AI systems for retraining and workforce development."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "I think that's exciting areas that can be pushed even more, and it would have a huge, huge impact."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "What would you say are some of the open problems in education, sort of, it's exciting."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "So young kids and the older folks or just folks of all ages who need to be retrained, who need to sort of open themselves up to a whole nother area of work."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "What are the problems to be solved there?"}, {"time": 4280, "text": "How do you think robots can help?"}, {"time": 4282, "text": "We have the engagement aspect, right?"}, {"time": 4284, "text": "So we can figure out the engagement."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "That's not a... What do you mean by engagement?"}, {"time": 4288, "text": "So identifying whether a person is focused, is like that we can figure out."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "What we can figure out and there's some positive results in this is that personalized adaptation based on any concepts, right?"}, {"time": 4309, "text": "So imagine I think about, I have an agent and I'm working with a kid learning, I don't know, algebra two, can that same agent then switch and teach some type of new coding skill to a displaced mechanic?"}, {"time": 4331, "text": "Like, what does that actually look like, right?"}, {"time": 4334, "text": "Like hardware might be the same, content is different, two different target demographics of engagement."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "Like how do you do that?"}, {"time": 4344, "text": "How important do you think personalization is in human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 4348, "text": "And not just a mechanic or student, but like literally to the individual human being."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "I think personalization is really important, but a caveat is that I think we'd be okay if we can personalize to the group, right?"}, {"time": 4364, "text": "And so if I can label you as along some certain dimensions, then even though it may not be you specifically, I can put you in this group."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "So the sample size, this is how they best learn, this is how they best engage."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "Even at that level, it's really important."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And it's because, I mean, it's one of the reasons why educating in large classrooms is so hard, right?"}, {"time": 4393, "text": "You teach to the median, but there's these individuals that are struggling and then you have highly intelligent individuals and those are the ones that are usually kind of left out."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "So highly intelligent individuals may be disruptive and those who are struggling might be disruptive because they're both bored."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Yeah, and if you narrow the definition of the group or in the size of the group enough, you'll be able to address their individual, it's not individual needs, but really the most important group needs, right?"}, {"time": 4425, "text": "And that's kind of what a lot of successful recommender systems do with Spotify and so on."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "So it's sad to believe, but as a music listener, probably in some sort of large group, it's very sadly predictable."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "You have been labeled."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "Yeah, I've been labeled and successfully so because they're able to recommend stuff that I like."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "Yeah, but applying that to education, right?"}, {"time": 4447, "text": "There's no reason why it can't be done."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Do you have a hope for our education system?"}, {"time": 4453, "text": "I have more hope for workforce development."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "And that's because I'm seeing investments."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "Even if you look at VC investments in education, the majority of it has lately been going to workforce retraining, right?"}, {"time": 4468, "text": "And so I think that government investments is increasing."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "There's like a claim and some of it's based on fear, right?"}, {"time": 4476, "text": "Like AI is gonna come and take over all these jobs."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "What are we gonna do with all these nonpaying taxes that aren't coming to us by our citizens?"}, {"time": 4484, "text": "And so I think I'm more hopeful for that."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "Not so hopeful for early education because it's still a who's gonna pay for it."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "And you won't see the results for like 16 to 18 years."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "It's hard for people to wrap their heads around that."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "But on the retraining part, what are your thoughts?"}, {"time": 4510,

go away?"}, {"time": 4559, "text": "What I worry about is the type of jobs that will come out."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "Like people who graduate from Georgia Tech will be okay."}, {"time": 4566,

and everywhere."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "I worry about that."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "I also worry about not having equal access to all these wonderful things that AI can do and robotics can do."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "People like me from Georgia Tech from say MIT will be okay, right?"}, {"time": 4610, "text": "But that's such a small part of the population that we need to think much more globally of having access to the beautiful things, whether it's AI in healthcare, AI in education, AI in politics, right?"}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And that's part of the thing that you were talking about is people that build the technology have to be thinking about ethics, have to be thinking about access and all those things."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "And not just a small subset."},

"text": "Yeah, although she kind of didn't fall in love with him or she fell in love with like a million other people, something like that."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "You're the jealous type, I see."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "We humans are the jealous type."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "Yes, so I do believe that we can design systems where people would fall in love with their robot, with their AI partner."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "That I do believe."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Because it's actually, and I don't like to use the word manipulate, but as we see, there are certain individuals that can be manipulated if you understand the cognitive science about it, right?"}, {"time": 4696, "text": "Right, so I mean, if you could think of all close relationship and love in general as a kind of mutual manipulation, that dance, the human dance."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "I mean, manipulation is a negative connotation."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "And that's why I don't like to use that word particularly."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "I guess another way to phrase it is, you're getting at is it could be algorithmatized or something, it could be a."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "The relationship building part can be."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "I mean, just think about it."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "We have, and I don't use dating sites, but from what I heard, there are some individuals that have been dating that have never saw each other, right?"}, {"time": 4732, "text": "In fact, there's a show I think that tries to like weed out fake people."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Like there's a show that comes out, right?"}, {"time": 4739, "text": "Because like people start faking."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "Like, what's the difference of that person on the other end being an AI agent, right?"}, {"time": 4748, "text": "And having a communication and you building a relationship remotely, like there's no reason why that can't happen."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "In terms of human robot interaction, so what role, you've kind of mentioned with data emotion being, can be problematic if not implemented well, I suppose."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "What role does emotion and some other human like things, the imperfect things come into play here for good human robot interaction and something like love?"}, {"time": 4777, "text": "Yeah, so in this case, and you had asked, can an AI agent love a human back?"}, {"time": 4783, "text": "I think they can emulate love back, right?"}, {"time": 4787, "text": "And so what does that actually mean?"}, {"time": 4788, "text": "It just means that if you think about their programming, they might put the other person's needs in front of theirs in certain situations, right?"}, {"time": 4797, "text": "You look at, think about it as a return on investment."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "Like, what's my return on investment?"}, {"time": 4801, "text": "As part of that equation, that person's happiness, has some type of algorithm waiting to it."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "And the reason why is because I care about them, right?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "That's the only reason, right?"}, {"time": 4813, "text": "But if I care about them and I show that, then my final objective function is length of time of the engagement, right?"}, {"time": 4820, "text": "So you can think of how to do this actually quite easily."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "But that's not love?"}, {"time": 4827, "text": "Well, so that's the thing."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "I think it emulates love because we don't have a classical definition of love."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "Right, but, and we don't have the ability to look into each other's minds to see the algorithm."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "And I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is, is it possible that, especially if that's learned, especially if there's some mystery and black box nature to the system, how is that, you know?"}, {"time": 4857, "text": "How is it any different?"}, {"time": 4858, "text": "How is it any different in terms of sort of if the system says, I'm conscious, I'm afraid of death, and it does indicate that it loves you."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "Another way to sort of phrase it, be curious to see what you think."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "Do you think there'll be a time when robots should have rights?"}, {"time": 4880, "text": "You've kind of phrased the robot in a very roboticist way and just a really good way, but saying, okay, well, there's an objective function and I could see how you can create a compelling human robot interaction experience that makes you believe that the robot cares for your needs and even something like loves you."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "But what if the robot says, please don't turn me off?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "What if the robot starts making you feel like there's an entity, a being, a soul there, right?"}, {"time": 4910, "text": "Do you think there'll be a future, hopefully you won't laugh too much at this, but where they do ask for rights?"}, {"time": 4920, "text": "So I can see a future if we don't address it in the near term where these agents, as they adapt and learn, could say, hey, this should be something that's fundamental."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "I hopefully think that we would address it before it gets to that point."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "So you think that's a bad future?"}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Is that a negative thing where they ask we're being discriminated against?"}, {"time": 4947, "text": "I guess it depends on what role have they attained at that point, right?"}, {"time": 4954, "text": "And so if I think about now."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "Careful what you say because the robots 50 years from now I'll be listening to this and you'll be on TV saying, this is what roboticists used to believe."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "And so this is my, and as I said, I have a bias lens and my robot friends will understand that."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So if you think about it, and I actually put this in kind of the, as a roboticist, you don't necessarily think of robots as human with human rights, but you could think of them either in the category of property, or you can think of them in the category of animals, right?"}, {"time": 4994, "text": "And so both of those have different types of rights."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "So animals have their own rights as a living being, but they can't vote, they can't write, they can be euthanized, but as humans, if we abuse them, we go to jail, right?"}, {"time": 5012, "text": "So they do have some rights that protect them, but don't give them the rights of like citizenship."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "And then if you think about property, property, the rights are associated with the person, right?"}, {"time": 5025, "text": "So if someone vandalizes your property or steals your property, like there are some rights, but it's associated with the person who owns that."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "If you think about it back in the day, and if you remember, we talked about how society has changed, women were property, right?"}, {"time": 5048, "text": "They were not thought of as having rights."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "They were thought of as property of, like their... Yeah, assaulting a woman meant assaulting the property of somebody else."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "Exactly, and so what I envision is, is that we will establish some type of norm at some point, but that it might evolve, right?"}, {"time": 5069, "text": "Like if you look at women's rights now, like there are still some countries that don't have, and the rest of the world is like, why that makes no sense, right?"}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And so I do see a world where we do establish some type of grounding."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "It might be based on property rights, it might be based on animal rights."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "And if it evolves that way, I think we will have this conversation at that time, because that's the way our society traditionally has evolved."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "Beautifully put, just out of curiosity, Anki, Jibo, Mayflower Robotics, with their robot Curie, SciFiWorks, WeThink Robotics, were all these amazing robotics companies led, created by incredible roboticists, and they've all went out of business recently."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "Why do you think they didn't last long?"}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Why is it so hard to run a robotics company, especially one like these, which are fundamentally HRI human robot interaction robots?"}, {"time": 5134, "text": "Or personal robots?"}, {"time": 5135, "text": "Each one has a story, only one of them I don't understand, and that was Anki."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "That's actually the only one I don't understand."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "I don't understand it either."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "No, no, I mean, I look like from the outside, I've looked at their sheets, I've looked at the data that's."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "Oh, you mean like business wise, you don't understand, I got you."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "Yeah, and like I look at all, I look at that data, and I'm like, they seem to have like product market fit."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "Like, so that's the only one I don't understand."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "The rest of it was product market fit."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "What's product market fit?"}, {"time": 5169, "text": "Just that of, like how do you think about it?"}, {"time": 5171, "text": "Yeah, so although WeThink Robotics was getting there, right?"}, {"time": 5175, "text": "But I think it's just the timing, it just, their clock just timed out."}, {"time": 5180, "text": "I think if they'd been given a couple more years, they would have been okay."}, {"time": 5185, "text": "But the other ones were still fairly early by the time they got into the market."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And so product market fit is, I have a product that I wanna sell at a certain price."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Are there enough people out there, the market, that are willing to buy the product at that market price for me to be a functional viable profit bearing company?"}, {"time": 5208, "text": "So product market fit."}, {"time": 5210, "text": "If it costs you a thousand dollars and everyone wants it and only is willing to pay a dollar, you have no product market fit."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "Even if you could sell it for, you know, it's enough for a dollar, cause you can't."}, {"time": 5223, "text": "So how hard is it for robots?"}, {"time": 5225, "text": "Sort of maybe if you look at iRobot, the company that makes Roombas, vacuum cleaners, can you comment on, did they find the right product, market product fit?"}, {"time": 5235, "text": "Like, are people willing to pay for robots is also another kind of question underlying all this."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "So if you think about iRobot and their story, right?"}, {"time": 5243, "text": "Like when they first, they had enough of a runway, right?"}, {"time": 5248, "text": "When they first started, they weren't doing vacuum cleaners, right?"}, {"time": 5251, "text": "They were contracts primarily, government contracts, designing robots."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "Or military robots."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's what they were."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "That's how they started, right?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "They still do a lot of incredible work there."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "But yeah, that was the initial thing that gave them enough funding to."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "To then try to, the vacuum cleaner is what I've been told was not like their first rendezvous in terms of designing a product, right?"}, {"time": 5276, "text": "And so they were able to survive until they got to the point that they found a product price market, right?"}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And even with, if you look at the Roomba, the price point now is different than when it was first released, right?"}, {"time": 5292, "text": "It was an early adopter price, but they found enough people who were willing to fund it."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "And I mean, I forgot what their loss profile was for the first couple of years, but they became profitable in sufficient time that they didn't have to close their doors."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "So they found the right, there's still people willing to pay a large amount of money, so over $1,000 for a vacuum cleaner."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "Unfortunately for them, now that they've proved everything out, figured it all out, now there's competitors."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "Yeah, and so that's the next thing, right?"}, {"time": 5323, "text": "The competition, and they have quite a number, even internationally."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "Like there's some products out there, you can go to Europe and be like, oh, I didn't even know this one existed."}, {"time": 5335, "text": "So this is the thing though, like with any market, I would, this is not a bad time, although as a roboticist, it's kind of depressing, but I actually think about things like with, I would say that all of the companies that are now in the top five or six, they weren't the first to the stage, right?"}, {"time": 5359, "text": "Like Google was not the first search engine, sorry, Altavista, right?"}, {"time": 5364, "text": "Facebook was not the first, sorry, MySpace, right?"}, {"time": 5368, "text": "Like think about it, they were not the first players."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "Those first players, like they're not in the top five, 10 of Fortune 500 companies, right?"}, {"time": 5379, "text": "They proved, they started to prove out the market, they started to get people interested, they started the buzz, but they didn't make it to that next level."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "But the second batch, right?"}, {"time": 5392, "text": "The second batch, I think might make it to the next level."}, {"time": 5397, "text": "When do you think the Facebook of robotics?"}, {"time": 5402, "text": "The Facebook of robotics."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "Sorry, I take that phrase back because people deeply, for some reason, well, I know why, but it's, I think, exaggerated distrust Facebook because of the privacy concerns and so on."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "And with robotics, one of the things you have to make sure is all the things we talked about is to be transparent and have people deeply trust you to let a robot into their lives, into their home."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "When do you think the second batch of robots will come?"}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Is it five, 10 years, 20 years that we'll have robots in our homes and robots in our hearts?"}, {"time": 5436, "text": "So if I think about, and because I try to follow the VC kind of space in terms of robotic investments, and

way the brain works though, is it's predicting all the time."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's constantly talking to itself, constantly talking to your body, and it's constantly predicting what's going on in the body and what's going on in the world and making predictions and the information from your body and from the world really confirm or correct those predictions."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So fundamentally the thing that the brain does most of the time is just like talking to itself and predicting stuff about the world, not like this dumb thing that just senses and responds, senses and responds."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Yeah, so the way to think about it is like this."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "You know, your brain is trapped in a dark silent box."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Yeah, that's very romantic of you."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Which is your skull."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And the only information that it receives from your body and from the world, right, is through the senses, through the sense organs, your eyes, your ears, and you have sensory data that comes from your body that you're largely unaware of to your brain, which we call interoceptive, as opposed to exteroceptive, which is the world around you."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "But your brain is receiving sense data continuously, which are the effect of some set of causes."}, {"time": 1717, "text":

those effects?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "So when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressure or a tug somewhere in your body, how does your brain know what caused those events so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And the answer is that your brain has one other source of information available to it, which is your past experience."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "It can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences, and it can combine those past experiences in novel ways."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "And so we have lots of names for this in psychology."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "We call it memory."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "We call it perceptual inference."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "We call it simulation."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "It's also, we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "We call it prediction."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Basically, if we were to stop the world right now, stop time, your brain

right?"}, {"time": 1813, "text": "Probabilistically, what's most likely to happen."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And it begins to prepare your action, and it begins to prepare your experience based, so it's anticipating the sense data it's going to receive."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And then when those data come in, they either confirm that prediction and your action executes because the plan's already been made, or there's some sense data that your brain didn't predict that's unexpected, and your brain takes it in."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "We say encodes it."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "We have a fancy name for that."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "We call it learning."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Your brain learns, and it updates its storehouse of knowledge, which we call an internal model so that you can predict better next time."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And it turns out that predicting and correcting, predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically efficient way to run a system than constantly reacting all the time."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Because if you're constantly reacting, it means you can't anticipate in any way what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And

impressive system is that relative to just the big predictor, model constructor."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Well, I think that we can look to evolution for that, for one answer, which is that when you go back, you know, 550 million years, give or take, we, you know, the world was populated by creatures, really ruled by creatures without brains."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "And, you know, that's a

these, there are these little, little creatures called amphioxus, which is the modern, it's a, or a lancet."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "That's the modern animal, but it's an animal that scientists believe is very similar to our common, the common ancestor that we share with invertebrates because, basically because of the tracing back, the molecular genetics and cells."}, {"time": 2003, "text":

not for seeing, but just for entraining to circadian rhythm, to light and dark."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And it had no hearing."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "It had a vestibular cell so that it could keep upright in the water."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So at the time, we're talking evolutionary scale here, so give or take some 100 million years or something, but at the time, what are the vertebrate, like when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved, a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs and when that's when your viscera, like internal systems involved."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So the answer I would say is that senses, motor neuroscientists, people who study the control of motor behavior believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So the idea is that, like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change?"}, {"time": 2089, "text": "What was the big pressure that made it useful to have eyes and ears and a visual system and an auditory system and a brain basically?"}, {"time": 2099, "text": "And the answer that is commonly entertained right now is that it was predation, that when at some point an animal evolved that deliberately ate another animal and this launched an arms race between predators and prey and it became very useful to have senses, right?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "So these little amphioxies don't really have, they're not aware of their environment very much, really."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And so being able to look up ahead and ask yourself, should I eat that or will it eat me is a very useful thing."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So the idea is that sense data is not there for consciousness."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "It didn't evolve for the purposes of consciousness."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "It didn't evolve for the purposes of experiencing anything."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It evolved to be in the service of motor control."}, {"time": 2173,

of fascinating that there was a time when life didn't eat each other."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Or they did by accident."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "So an amphioxus, for example, it kind of like gyrates in the water, and then it plants itself in the sand like a living blade of grass, and then it just filters whatever comes into its mouth."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "So it is eating, but it's not actively hunting."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "And when the concentration of food decreases, the amphioxus can sense this."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "And so it basically wriggles itself randomly to

2343, "text": "No, I mean, no, but I am also somewhat persuaded by, I think Dan Dennett wrote at one point, the philosopher Dan Dennett wrote at one point that it's, I can't say it as eloquently as him, but people obviously have free will, they are obviously making choices."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "So there is this observation that we're not robots and we can do some things like a little more sophisticated than an amphioxus."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "I would say that your predictions, your internal model that's running right now, your ability to understand the sounds that I'm making and

can understand the words that are coming out of my mouth."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Right, I think we did this once before too, didn't we?"}, {"time": 2409, "text": "When we were."}, {"time": 2410,

"Yeah, I think we did it just like that actually, so bravo."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "Wow, I have to go look back to the tape."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Yeah, anyways, the idea though is that your brain is using past experience and it can use past experience in, so it's remembering, but you're not consciously remembering."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "It's basically re implementing prior experiences as a way of predicting what's gonna happen next."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And it can do something called conceptual combination, which is it can take bits and pieces of the past and

process."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "So in a sense, you could say, well, that maybe that's a source of free will."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "But I think really where free will comes from or the kind of free will that I think is worth having a conversation about involves cultivating experiences for yourself that change your internal model."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "When you were born and you were

internal model basically."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "But when you grow up, the more control you have over where you are and what you do, you can cultivate new experiences for yourself."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "And those new experiences can change your internal model."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And you can actually practice those experiences in a way that makes them automatic, meaning it makes it easier for the brain, your brain to make them again."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And I think that that is something like what you would call free will."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "You aren't responsible for the model that you were handed, that someone, your caregivers cultivated a model in your brain."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "You're not responsible for that model, but you are

2579, "text": "Not everybody has choice over everything, but everybody has a little bit of choice."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "And so I think that is something that I think is arguably called free will."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Yeah, the ripple effects of the billions of decisions you make early on in life are so great that even if it's not, even if it's like all deterministic, just the amount of possibilities that are created and then the focusing on those possibilities into a single trajectory, that somewhere within that, that's free will."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "Even if it's all deterministic, that might as well be just the number of choices that are possible and the fact that you just make one trajectory to those set of choices seems to be like something like they'll be called free will."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "But it's still kind of sad to think like there doesn't seem to be a place where there's magic in there, where it is all just the computer."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "Well, there's lots of magic, I would say, so far, because we don't really understand how all of this is exactly played out at a, I mean, scientists are working hard and disagree about some of the details under the hood of what I just described, but I think there's quite a bit of magic actually."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And also there's also stochastic firing of, neurons don't, they're not purely digital in the sense that there is, there's also analog communication between neurons, not just digital."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So it's not just with firing of axons."},

some animals that have clusters of cells."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "The only job is to inject noise."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "You know, into their neural patterns."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "So maybe noise is the source of free will."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "So you can think about stochasticity or noise as a source of free will, or you can think of conceptual combination as a source of free will."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "You can certainly think about cultivating, you know, you can't reach back into your past and change your past."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "You know, people try by psychotherapy and so on, but what you can do is change your present, which becomes your past."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "So one way to think about it is that you're continuously, this is a colleague of mine, a friend of mine said, so what you're saying is that people are continually cultivating their past."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "And I was like, that's very poetic."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "Yes, you are continually cultivating your past as a means of controlling your future."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "So you think, yeah, I guess the construction of the mental model that you use for prediction ultimately contains within it your perception of the past, like the way you interpret the past, or even just the entirety of your narrative about the past."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "So you're constantly rewriting the story of your past."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "That's one poetic and also just awe inspiring."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "What about the other thing you talk about?"},

sure."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I actually did before this, so I apologize."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "Okay, no, well, that's okay."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "You apologize for not sharing."},

instructions."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "So scientists call it expectable input."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "The brain needs some input in order to develop normally."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And we

it."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's expensive for your brain to learn it."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "And it takes a while for the brain to get really automated with it."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "But

Darwin said, no, it's not error, it's meaningful."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "So nature selects on the basis of that variation."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "The reason why natural selection is powerful

the function."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "Yeah, what I'm saying is that what Darwin, Darwin really talked about variation in, so if you read, for example, the biologist Ernst Mayr, who was an

out that's not a perfect criterion to use, but it's a functional criterion, right?"}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So what I'm saying is that in cognitive science, people came up with the idea, they

you can use consistent science, since the consistent scientific findings to organize your behavior."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "That doesn't mean that rationality is the absence of emotion, because

that you can act on."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "Yeah, and then try to, I mean, this is kind of what empathy is in open mindedness, is try to consider that the set of concepts that your brain has constructed through which you are now perceiving the world is not painting the full picture."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "I mean, this is now true for basically every, it doesn't have to be men and

"There are people who, scientists who will talk to you about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy and I prefer to think of it, I think the evidence is more consistent with what I'm about to say,

are just brilliant, so the experiential blindness but also from my perspective, like I preach and I try to practice empathy a lot and something about the way you've explained it makes me almost see it as a kind of exercise that we should all do, like to train, like to add experiences to the brain to expand this capacity to predict more effectively."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "So like what I do is kind of like a method acting thing which is I imagine what the life of a person is like."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "Just think, I mean, this is something you see with Black Lives Matter and police

phi."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And I think that that is obvious nonsense."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "As soon as you think about it for like a minute, as soon as you think about it in terms of, could I construct a system that had an enormous value of phi, like, you know, even larger than the brain has, but that is just implementing an error correcting code, you know, doing nothing that we would associate with, you know, intelligence or consciousness or any of it."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "The answer is yes, it is easy to do that."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And so I wrote blog posts, just

I admired it in a way because instead of disputing any of it, he just bit the bullet in the sense, you know, he was one of the, the, uh, the most, uh, uh, audacious bullet bitings I've ever seen in my career."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "He said, okay, then fine."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "You know, this system that just applies this error correcting code it's conscious, you know, and if it has a much larger value of phi than you or me, it's much more conscious than you and me."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "You know, you, we just have to accept what the theory says because, you know, science is not about confirming our intuitions."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It's about challenging them."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And, you know, this is what my theory predicts that this thing is conscious and, you know, or super duper conscious."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And how are you going to prove me wrong?"}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So the way I would argue against your blog posts is I would say, yes, sure."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "You're right in general, but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on earth, the, this rule of the larger fee being associated, being associated with more consciousness is correct."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So that's not what he said at all."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "Because he wants this to be completely general."},

general apply to aliens, to computers, to animals, coma patients, to any of it."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And so, so, so he just said, well, you know, Scott is relying on his intuition, but, you know, I'm relying on this theory and, you know, to me it was almost like, you know, are we being serious here?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Like, like, like, you know, like, like, okay, yes, in science we try to learn highly nonintuitive things, but what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we already know the answer."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Like if we, if someone had a new theory of temperature, right, then, you know, maybe we could check that it says that boiling water is hotter than ice."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything, you know, you've ever experienced, then maybe we, we trust that extrapolation."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "But like this, this theory, like if, if, you know, it's now saying that, you know, a, a gigantic

more?"}, {"time": 5036, "text": "I mean, just for starters, there is everything that we could do with a conventional computer with a polynomial amount of memory, okay, but possibly an exponential

understood about it?"}, {"time": 5240, "text": "Okay, so P is contained in BPP, which is contained in BQP, which is contained in P space, okay?"}, {"time": 5247, "text": "So anything you can, in fact, in something very similar to sharp P.

"Oh, that's an excellent question."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "So there is, well, I mean, one has to prove that, okay?"}, {"time": 5264, "text": "But the proof, you could think of it as using Richard

one."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Yeah, we did last time."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "But yeah, we did last time, okay?"}, {"time": 5289, "text": "But basically, you could always think of a quantum computation as like a branching tree of possibilities where each possible path that you could take through, you know, the space has a complex number attached to it called an amplitude, okay?"}, {"time": 5304, "text": "And now the rule is, you know, when you make a measurement at the end, well, you see a random answer, okay?"}, {"time": 5316, "text": "But quantum mechanics is all about calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one, right?"}, {"time": 5320, "text": "And the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answer."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And then, you know, that's a complex number, so that, you know, how could that be a probability?"}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Then you take the squared absolute value of the result."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "That gives you a number between zero and one, okay?"}, {"time": 5344, "text": "So yeah, I just summarized quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds, okay?"}, {"time": 5350, "text": "But now, you know, what this already tells us is that anything I can do with a quantum computer, I could simulate with a classical computer if I only have exponentially more time, okay?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Because if I have exponential time, I could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of these amplitudes, right?"}, {"time": 5370, "text": "You know, that will be very inefficient, but it will work, right?"}, {"time": 5376, "text": "It's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem or, you know, they could never do anything that is literally uncomputable in Turing's sense, okay?"}, {"time": 5387, "text": "But now, as I said, there's even a stronger result which says that BQP is contained in PSPACE."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "The way that we prove that is that we say, if all I want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really, then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "All I need to do is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitudes that lead to that state."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum, but I can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the sum."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And hence the p, in the PSPACE?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Hence the PSPACE."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So what, out of that whole complexity zoo, and it could be BQP, what do you find is the most, the class that captured your heart the most, the most beautiful class that's just, yeah."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "I used, as my email address, bqpqpoly at gmail.com."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "Yes, because BQP slash Qpoly, well, you know, amazingly no one had taken it."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "Amazing, amazing."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "But, you know, this is a class that I was involved in sort of defining, proving the first theorems about in 2003 or so."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "So it was kind of close to my heart."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "But this is like, if we extended BQP, which is the class of everything we can do efficiently with a quantum computer, to allow quantum advice, which means imagine that you had some special initial state, okay, that could somehow help you do computation."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "And maybe such a state would be exponentially hard to prepare, okay, but maybe somehow these states were formed in the Big Bang or something, and they've just been sitting around ever since, right?"}, {"time": 5506, "text": "If you found one, and if this state could be like ultra power, there are no limits on how powerful it could be, except that this state doesn't know in advance which input you've got, right?"}, {"time": 5518, "text": "It only knows the size of your input."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "You know, and that's BQP slash Qpoly."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "So that's one that I just personally happen to love, okay?"}, {"time": 5525, "text": "But, you know, if you're asking like what's the, you know, there's a class that I think is way more beautiful or fundamental than a lot of people even within this field realize that it is."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "That class is called SZK, or Statistical Zero Knowledge."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "And, you know, there's a very, very easy way to define this class, which is to say, suppose that I have two algorithms that each sample from probability distributions, right?"}, {"time": 5552, "text": "So each one just outputs random samples according to, you know, possibly different distributions."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And now the question I ask is, you know, let's say distributions over strings of n bits, you know, so over an exponentially large space."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Now I ask, are these two distributions close or far as close or far as probability distributions?"}, {"time": 5577, "text": "Any problem that can be reduced to that, you know, that can be put into that form is an SZK problem."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "And the way that this class was originally discovered was completely different from that and was kind of more complicated."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "It was discovered as the class of all of the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "Zero knowledge proofs are one of the central ideas in cryptography."}, {"time": 5601, "text":

people use nowadays."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "But zero knowledge proofs are ways of proving to someone that something is true, like, you know, that there is a solution to this, you know, optimization problem or that these two graphs are isomorphic to each other or something, but without revealing why it's true, without revealing anything about why it's true."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "SZK is all of the problems for which there is such a proof that doesn't rely on any cryptography."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "And if you wonder, like, how could such a thing possibly exist, right?"}, {"time": 5653, "text": "Well, like, imagine that I had two graphs and I wanted to convince you that these two graphs are not isomorphic, meaning, you know, I cannot permute one of them so that it's the same as the other one, right?"}, {"time": 5666, "text": "You know, that might be a very hard statement to prove, right?"}, {"time": 5670, "text": "I might need, you know, you might have to do a very exhaustive enumeration of, you know, all the different permutations before you were convinced that it was true."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "But what if there were some all knowing wizard that said to you, look, I'll tell you what, just pick one of the graphs randomly, then randomly permute it, then send it to me and I will tell you which graph you started with."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And I will do that every single time."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And let's say that that wizard did that a hundred times and it was right every time."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "Now, if the graphs were isomorphic, then, you know, it would have been flipping a coin each time, right?"}, {"time": 5708, "text": "It would have had only a one and two to the 100 power chance of, you know, of guessing right each time."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "But, you know, so, so if it's right every time, then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs are not isomorphic, even though you've learned nothing new about why they aren't."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "So, so SDK is all of the problems that have protocols like that one, but it has this beautiful other characterization."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "It's shown up again and again in my, in my own work and, you know, a lot of people's work."}, {"time": 5740, "text": "And I think that it really is one of the most fundamental classes."}, {"time":

like little details of how you collect that data and also what your intuition behind the two days is."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So first off, it has to be the right two days."}, {"time": 568, "text": "But I was thinking of a very specific experiment."}, {"time": 572, "text": "There's actually a suite of them that I've been a part of, and other people have done this, of course."}, {"time": 576, "text": "I just sort of dabbled in that part of the world."}, {"time": 576, "text": "But to be very clear, the specific thing that I was talking about had to do with recording all the IR going on in my infrared going on in my house."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So this is a long time ago."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So this is everything's being curled by pressing buttons on remote controls, as opposed to speaking to Alexa or Siri or someone like that."}, {"time": 596, "text": "And I was just trying to figure out if you could get enough data on people to figure out what they were going to do with their TVs or their lights."}, {"time": 601, "text": "My house was completely wired up at the time."}, {"time": 606, "text": "But you know, what I'm about to look at a movie, I'm about to turn on the TV or whatever and just see what I could predict from it."}, {"time": 610, "text": "It was kind of surprising."}, {"time": 610, "text": "It shouldn't have been."}, {"time": 610, "text": "But that's all very easy to do, by the way, just capturing all the little stuff."}, {"time": 616, "text": "I mean, it's a bunch of computers systems."}, {"time": 619, "text": "It's really easy to capture today if you know what you're looking for."}, {"time": 619, "text": "At Georgia Tech, long before I got there, we had this thing called the Aware Home, where everything was wired up and you captured everything that was going on."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Nothing even difficult, not with video or anything like that, just the way that the system was just capturing everything."}, {"time": 631, "text": "So it turns out that, and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked with many other people."}, {"time": 637, "text": "And it turns out at the end of the day, people do the same things over and over and over again."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So it has to be the right two days, like a weekend."}, {"time": 647, "text": "But it turns out not only can you predict what someone's going to do next at the level of what button they're going to press next on a remote control, but you can do it with something really, really simple."}, {"time": 655, "text": "You don't even need a hidden mark off model."}, {"time": 661, "text": "It's like a mark, just simply, I press this, this is my prediction of the next thing."}, {"time": 665, "text": "It turns out you can get 93% accuracy just by doing something very simple and stupid and just counting statistics."}, {"time": 671, "text": "But what was actually more interesting is that you could use that information."}, {"time": 675, "text": "This comes up again and again in my work."}, {"time": 675, "text": "If you try to represent people or objects by the things they do, the things you can measure about them that have to do with action in the world."}, {"time": 681, "text": "So distribution over actions, and you try to represent them by the distribution of actions that are done on them, then you do a pretty good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster remarkably well, in fact, irritatingly so."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And so by clustering people this way, you can maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy of what's the next button you're going to press, but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere there's about on the collections of things you might press."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other and exactly what you would expect."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So for example, all the key, all the numbers on a keypad, it turns out all have the same behavior with respect to you as a human being."}, {"time": 724, "text": "And so you would naturally cluster them together and you discover that numbers are all related to one another in some way and all these other things."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And then, and here's the part that I think is important."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I mean, you can see this in all kinds of things."}, {"time": 738, "text": "Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably predictable because you keep doing the same things over and over again."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And the two things that I've learned in the long time that I've been thinking about this is people are easily predictable and people hate when you tell them that they're easily predictable, but they are."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And there you go."}, {"time": 759, "text": "What about, let me play devil's advocate and philosophically speaking, is it possible to say that what defines humans is the outlier."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So even though many, some large percentage of our behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it's the special moments of when we break out of the routine is the definitive thing that we're breaking out of the routine is the definitive things."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And the way we break out of that routine for each one of us might be different."}, {"time": 787, "text": "I would say that I would say it a little differently."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I think I would make two things."}, {"time": 791, "text": "One is a, I'm going to disagree with the premise, I think, but that's fine."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I think the way I would put it is there are people who are very different from lots of other people, but they're not 0%, they're closer to 10%, right?"}, {"time": 802, "text": "So in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people, that'll turn out to be the small number they all behave like each other, even if they individually behave very differently from everyone else."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So I think that's kind of important."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But what you're really asking, I think, and I think this is really a question is, what do you do when you're faced with the situation you've never seen before?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "What do you do when you're faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you've seen others do and you're actually forced to do something and you react to that very differently."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And that is the thing that makes you human."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it's the times when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make where the answer isn't easy, even if you know what the right answer is, that's sort of what defines you as the individual."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And I think what defines people broadly, it's the hard problem."}, {"time": 848, "text": "It's not the easy problem."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's the thing that's going to hurt you."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's not even that it's difficult."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And I do think that that's a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So before we talk about sort of explore the different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence, which we are working on, let me just go along this thread to skip to kind of our world of social media, which is something that at least on the artificial intelligence side you think about."}, {"time": 884, "text": "There's a popular narrative, I don't know if it's true, but that we have these silos in social media and we have these clusterings, as you're kind of mentioning."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And the idea is that, you know, along that narrative is that, you know, we want to, we want to break each other out of those silos so we can be empathetic to other people, to if you're a Democrat, you'd be empathetic to the Republican."}, {"time": 912, "text": "If you're Republican, you're empathetic Democrat."}, {"time": 912, "text": "Those are just two silly bins that we seem to be very excited about, but there's other binnings that we can think about."}, {"time": 917, "text": "Is there, from an artificial intelligence perspective, because you're just saying we cluster along the data, but then interactive artificial intelligence is referring to throwing agents into that mix, AI systems in that mix, helping us interacting with us humans and maybe getting us out of that mix, maybe getting us out of those silos."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Is that something that you think is possible?"}, {"time": 941, "text": "Do you see a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks of people to get us outside of our habits in at least the idea space to where we can sort of be empathetic to other people's lived experiences, other people's points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 971, "text": "Yes, and I actually don't think it's that hard."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Well, it's not hard in this sense."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So imagine that you can, let's just, let's make life simple for a minute."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Let's assume that you can do a kind of partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It doesn't even matter what I mean here, so long as there's some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster, there's some edge between them, right?"}, {"time": 991, "text": "And this is kind of, they don't quite touch even, or maybe they come very close."}, {"time": 995, "text": "If you can imagine that conceptually, then the way you get from here to here is not by going from here to here."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly together, right?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing once we can kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So it's easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships, you know, the edges and sort of the strengths on them and you kind of have some semantic meaning for them, the machine doesn't have to, you do as the designer, then yeah, I think you can kind of move people along and sort of expand them."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "But it's harder than that."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And the reason it's harder than that, or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard, is because I'm gonna tell you a story that someone else told me and I don't, I may get some of the details a little bit wrong, but it's roughly, it roughly goes like this."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You take two sets of people from the same backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "So you separate them up, which we do all the time, right?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Oh, you know, we're gonna break out in the, we're gonna break out groups."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "You're gonna go over there and you're gonna talk about this."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And then you have them sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another, and you have them sort of interact with one another."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "When they come back to talk about what they learn, you want to merge what they've done together."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "It can be extremely hard because they don't, they basically don't speak the same language anymore."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Like when you create these problems and you dive into them, you create your own language."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "So the example this one person gave me, which I found kind of interesting because we were in the middle of that at the time, was they're sitting over there and they're talking about these rooms that you can see, but you're seeing them from different vantage points, depending on what side of the room you're on."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "They can see a clock very easily."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "And so they start referring to the room as the one with the clock."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "This group over here, looking at the same room, they can see the clock, but it's, you know, not in their line of sight or whatever."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So they end up referring to it by some other way."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "When they get back together and they're talking about things, they're referring to the same room and they don't even realize they're referring to the same room."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And in fact, this group doesn't even see that there's a clock there and this group doesn't see whatever's the clock on the wall is the thing that stuck with me."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So if you create these different silos, the problem isn't that the ideologies disagree."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "It's that you're using the same words and they mean radically different things."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "The hard part is just getting them to agree on the, well, maybe we'd say the axioms in our world, right?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "But you know, just get them to agree on some basic definitions because right now they talk, they're talking past each other, just completely talking past each other."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "That's the hard part, getting them to meet, getting them to interact."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "That may not be that difficult."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Getting them to see where their language is leading them to lead past one another."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "That's, that's the hard part."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It's a really interesting question to me."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It could be on the layer of language, but it feels like there's multiple layers to this."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Like it could be worldview."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "It could be, I mean, all boils down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes of the other person to learn the language, to learn like visually how they see the world, to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now with, with trolls, the, the degree of humor in that world."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "For example, I talk about love a lot."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "I'm very like, I'm really lucky to have this amazing community of loving people."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "But whenever I encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because it's so quote unquote cringe."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So, so they, they show love by like derision, I would say."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And I think about on the human level, that's a whole nother discussion."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "That's psychology, that's sociology, so on."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "But I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and to bridge the gap of what is this person's life like?"}, {"time": 1210, "text": "Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the agitations, the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, to even just to think about what was their upbringing like, like having a, a single parent home or a shitty education or all those kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "It feels like that's really important."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "For us to, to, to bring those clusters together, to find that similar language."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But it's unclear how AI can help that because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So the, you know, the word understand, there's doing a lot of work, right?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So do you have to understand it or do you just simply have to note that there is something similar as a point to touch, right?"}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So, you know, you use the word empathy and I like that word, for a lot of reasons, I think you're right in the way that you're using in the ways you're describing, but let's separate it from sympathy, right?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone, empathy is kind of understanding where they're coming from and how they, how they feel, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And for most people, those things go hand in hand."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "For some people, some are very good at empathy and very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Some people cannot experience, well, my observation would be, I'm not a psychologist, my observation would be that some people seem to be very, very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "My observation would be that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy unless they feel empathy first."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "You can understand someone, understand where they're coming from and still think, no, I can't support that, right?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "It doesn't mean that the only way I, because if that, if that isn't the case, then what it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can, to understand someone means you must agree with everything that they do, which isn't right, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "I can feel for someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Well, then we're lost, right?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Because we're not all exactly like each other."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "I have to understand everything that you've gone through."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "It helps clearly, but they're separable ideas, right?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Even though they get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So what I think AI could help you do actually is if, and you know, I'm, I'm being quite fanciful as it were, but if you, if you think of these as kind of, I understand how you interact, the words that you use, the, you know, the actions you take, I have some way of doing this."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Let's not worry about what that is."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But I can see you as a kind of distribution of experiences and actions taken upon you, things you've done and so on."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And I can do this with someone else and I can find the places where there's some kind of commonality, a mapping as it were, even if it's not total, you know, the, if I think of this as distribution, right, then, you know, I can take the cosine of the angle between you and if it's, you know, if it's zero, you've got nothing in common."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "If it's one, you're completely the same person."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Well, you know, you're probably not one."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "You're almost certainly not zero."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "I can find the place where there's the overlap, then I might be able to introduce you on that basis or connect you in that, connect you in that way and make it easier for you to take that step of that step of empathy."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "It's not, it's not impossible to do."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Although I wonder if it requires that everyone involved is at least interested in asking the question."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So maybe the hard part is just getting them interested in asking the question."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "In fact, maybe if you can get them to ask the question, how are we more alike than we are different, they'll solve it themselves."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Maybe that's the problem that AI should be working on, not telling you how you're similar or different, but just getting you to decide that it's worthwhile asking the question."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "It feels like an economist's answer actually."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Well, people, okay, first of all, people like would disagree."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So let me disagree slightly, which is, I think everything you said is brilliant, but I tend to believe philosophically speaking that people are interested underneath it all."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And I would say that AI, the, the possibility that an AI system would show the commonality is incredible."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "That's a really good starting point."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I would say if you, if on social media, I could discover the common things deep or shallow between me and a person who there's tension with, I think that my basic human nature would take over from there."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "And I think enjoy that commonality."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "And like, there's something sticky about that, that my mind will linger on and that person in my mind will become like warmer and warmer."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And like, I'll start to give a feel more and more compassion towards them."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I think for majority of the population, that's true, but that might be, that's a hypothesis."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "I mean, it's an empirical question, right?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "You'd have to figure it out."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "I mean, I want to believe you're right."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And so I'm going to say that I think you're right."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Of course, some people come to those things for the purpose of trolling, right?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And it doesn't matter that they're playing a different game."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "I, you know, my experience is it requires two things."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "It requires, in fact, maybe this is really at the end what you're saying."},

that long."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "It's just difficult to do."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "It takes, it takes a toll on you."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But more importantly, we know this both from people having done studies on it, but also from our own experiences, that it is much easier to be dismissive of a person if they're not in front of you, if they're not real, right?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So much of the history of the world is about making people other, right?"}, {"time": 1535, "text": "So if you're social media, if you're on the web, if you're doing whatever in the internet,

their humanity because it's in front of you."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "The other is of course that, you know, they might punch you in the face if you go too far."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So, you know, both of those things kind of work together, I think to the, to the right end."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So I think bringing people together is really a kind of substitute for forcing them to

people who are out there on the front lines doing the fighting, to me, those people can be compared with police officers and firemen and people, fire persons, but I mean, people that are involved in

victims in our society of war are often the warriors."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "So in my mind, when we see these people coming home from places like Iraq, a place where I would have made the argument

more."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "They seem to just start out just valuing the skill of fighting whatever the tools of war they had, which were pretty primitive, but just to be the best warriors they

for a young teenage guy requires you to feign empathy, requires you to read deeper subjects because that's what people are into, you can almost, as a silly way to be trendy, you could make maybe empathy trendy, love trendy, solutions that are the opposite of that, the kind of things that people inherently will not put up with."}, {"time": 9667, "text": "In other words, the possibility exists to change the zeitgeist and reorient it in a way that even if most of the people aren't serious about it, the results are the same."}, {"time": 9681, "text": "Okay, so we've found a meeting of the

both of us, okay?"}, {"time": 9717, "text": "So, but you and I, as I mentioned to you, I think off mic, been friends for a long time."}, {"time": 9723, "text": "It's just been one way."}, {"time":

don't need it."}, {"time": 9878, "text": "They have figured this out."}, {"time": 9879, "text": "The people that sometimes need help are brand new people trying to figure out what do I do with my

specific things like we were talking offline about monetization."}, {"time": 9901, "text": "That's a fascinating one."}, {"time": 9903, "text": "Very difficult as an independent, yeah."}, {"time": 9905, "text": "And one of the things that Joe is facing with, I don't know if you're paying attention, but he joined Spotify with a $100 million deal for going exclusive on their platform."}, {"time": 9918, "text": "The idea of exclusivity that, one, I don't give a damn about money personally, but I'm single, and I like living in a shitty place."}, {"time": 9926, "text": "So I enjoy, so I guess it makes it easy."}, {"time": 9930, "text": "You get the freedom, right, to not care, yeah."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "Freedom."}, {"time": 9934, "text": "Not saving for anybody's college."}, {"time": 9937, "text": "Okay, so on that point, but I also, okay, maybe it's romanticization, but I feel like podcasting is pirate radio."}, {"time": 9946, "text": "And when I first heard about Spotify partnering up with Joe, I was like, you know, fuck the man."}, {"time": 9953, "text": "I said, I even, I drafted a few tweets and so on, just like attacking Spotify, then I calmed myself down that you can't lock up this special thing we have."}, {"time": 9964, "text": "But then I realized that maybe that these are vehicles for just reaching more people and actually respecting podcasters more and so on."}, {"time": 9975, "text": "So that's what I mean by it's unclear what the journey is because you also serve as beacon for, now there's like millions, one million plus podcasters."}, {"time": 9989, "text": "I wonder what the journey is."}, {"time": 9991, "text": "Do you have a sense, are you romantic in the same kind of way in feeling that, because you have a roots in radio too."}, {"time": 10001, "text": "Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio or is the Spotify thing one possible avenue?"}, {"time": 10008, "text": "Are you nervous about Joe as a fan, as a friend of Joe or is this a good thing for us?"}, {"time": 10015, "text": "So my history of how I got involved in podcasting is interesting."}, {"time": 10021, "text": "I was in radio and then I started a company back in the era where the dot com boom was happening and everybody was being bought up and it just seemed like a great idea, right?"}, {"time": 10032, "text": "I did it with six other people and the whole goal of the company was, we had to invent the term."}, {"time": 10039, "text": "I'm sure everybody, there's other places that invented it at the same time."}, {"time": 10042, "text": "But what we were pitching to investors was something called amateur content."}, {"time": 10046, "text": "So this is before YouTube, before podcasting, before all this stuff."}, {"time": 10050, "text": "And my job was to be the evangelist."}, {"time": 10054, "text": "And I would go to these people and talk and sing the praises of all the ways that amateur content was gonna be great."}, {"time": 10062, "text": "And I never got a bite."}, {"time": 10065, "text": "And they all told me the same thing."}, {"time": 10066, "text": "This isn't gonna take off cause anybody who's good is already gonna be making money at this."}, {"time": 10071, "text": "And I kept saying, forget that."}, {"time": 10073, "text": "We're talking about scale here."}, {"time": 10075, "text": "If you have millions of pieces of content being made every week, a small percentage is gonna be good no matter what, right?"}, {"time": 10081, "text": "16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like."}, {"time": 10083, "text": "I kept pushing this nobody bit."}, {"time": 10086, "text": "But the podcast grew out of that because if you're talking about amateur content in 1999, well then you're already, you're ahead of the game in terms of not seeing where it's gonna go financially but seeing where it's going to go technologically."}, {"time": 10103, "text": "And so when we started the podcast in 2005 and it was the political one, not hardcore history, which was an outgrowth of the old radio show, we didn't have any financial ideas."}, {"time": 10114, "text": "We were simply trying to get our handle on the technology and how you distribute it to people and all that."}, {"time": 10118, "text": "And it was years later that we tried to figure out, okay, how can we get enough money to just support us while we're doing this?"}, {"time": 10125, "text": "And the cheap and the easy way was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind of model."}, {"time": 10129, "text": "And that was the original model."}, {"time": 10132, "text": "So then once we started down that, we figured out other models and there's the advertising thing and that we sell the old shows."}, {"time": 10138, "text": "And so all these became ways for us to support ourselves."}, {"time": 10143, "text": "But as podcasting matured and as more operating systems developed and phones were developed and all these kinds of things, every one of those developments, which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast actually made it more complex to make money off of them."}, {"time": 10162, "text": "So while our audience was building, the amount of time and effort we had to put into the monetization side began to skyrocket."}, {"time": 10169, "text": "So to get back to your Spotify question, to use just one example, there's a lot of people who are doing similar things."}, {"time": 10176, "text": "In this day and age, we used to just sell MP3 files."}, {"time": 10179, "text": "And all you had to have was an MP3 player, it's cheap and dirty."}, {"time": 10182, "text": "Now, every time there's an OS upgrade, something breaks for us."}, {"time": 10186, "text": "So we're having, I mean, my choices are at this point to start hiring staff, more staff, and then be a human resources manager."}, {"time": 10194, "text": "I mean, the pirate radio side of this was the pirate radio side of this because you didn't need anybody, but you know, you or you and another, I mean, you could just do this lean and mean, and it's becoming hard to do it lean and mean now."}, {"time": 10205, "text": "So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says, hey, we'll handle that stuff for you."}, {"time": 10210, "text": "In the past, I would just say, F off, we don't need you, I don't mind."}, {"time": 10215, "text": "And I definitely am not making what we could make on this, but what we would have to do to make that is onerous to me."}, {"time": 10222, "text": "But it's becoming onerous to me day to day anyway."}, {"time": 10225, "text": "And so if somebody were to come in and say, hey, we'll pick that up for you, we will not interfere with your content at all, we won't, and in my case, you can't say, we need to show a month because that ain't happening, right?"}, {"time": 10236, "text": "So I mean, everybody's design is different, right?"}, {"time": 10240, "text": "So it doesn't, you know, there's not one size fits all, but I guess as a long time pirate podcaster, we've been looking to partner with people, but nobody's right for us to partner with."}, {"time": 10251, "text": "I mean, so I'm always looking for ways to take that side of it off my plate because I'm not interested in that side."}, {"time": 10259, "text": "All I wanna do is the shows, and it's really at this point, you shouldn't call yourself an artist because that's something to be decided by others."}, {"time": 10268, "text": "But I mean, we're trying to do art and there's something very satisfying in that."}, {"time": 10275, "text": "But the part that I can't stand is the increasing amount of time the monetization question takes upon us."}, {"time": 10282, "text": "So there's a case to be made, I guess is what I'm saying, that if a partnership with some outside firm enhances your ability to do the art without disenhancing your ability to do the art, it's, the word I'm looking for here is it's enticing."}, {"time": 10302, "text": "I don't like big companies."}, {"time": 10304, "text": "So I'm afraid of whatever strings might come with that."}, {"time": 10309, "text": "And if I'm Joe Rogan and I'm talking about subjects that can make public companies a little nervous, I would certainly be careful."}, {"time": 10317, "text": "But at the same time, people who are not in this game don't understand the problems that literally, I mean, just all the operating systems, all the podcatchers, every time some new podcatcher comes up, makes it easier to get the podcast, that's something we have to account for on the back end."}, {"time": 10334, "text": "And I'm not exactly the technological wizard of all time."}, {"time": 10337, "text": "So I think it is maybe, maybe the short answer is, is that as the medium develops, it's becoming something that you have to consider, not because you wanna sell out, but because you wanna keep going."}, {"time": 10350, "text": "And it's becoming harder and harder to be pirate like in this environment."}, {"time": 10355, "text": "The thing that convinced me, especially inside Spotify, is that they understand, so if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism, as you're saying, of big companies, then it works because Spotify understands the magic that makes podcasting, or they appear to in part, at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 10380, "text": "And despite what, I don't know if you, so there's the internet and there's people with opinions on the internet."}, {"time": 10386, "text": "I've not heard about that."}, {"time": 10387, "text": "And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify."}, {"time": 10391, "text": "But the reality is, there's two things in private conversation with Joe, and in general, there's two important things."}, {"time": 10399, "text": "One, Spotify literally doesn't tell Joe anything."}, {"time": 10402, "text": "Like all the people that think that Spotify is somehow pushing Joe in this direction."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "It's a contractual, didn't he insist upon that?"}, {"time": 10410, "text": "It's in the contract."}, {"time": 10411, "text": "But also, companies have a way of, even with the contract."}, {"time": 10414, "text": "They sure do."}, {"time": 10416, "text": "To be marketing people, hey, I know we're not forcing you."}, {"time": 10419, "text": "I hate that."}, {"time": 10421, "text": "Yeah, I'm with you."}, {"time": 10422, "text": "You and Joe are the same, and Spotify is smart enough not to send a single email of that kind."}, {"time": 10428, "text": "That's really smart."}, {"time": 10429, "text": "And they leave them be."}, {"time": 10431, "text": "There is meetings inside Spotify that people complain, but those meetings never reach Joe."}, {"time": 10438, "text": "That's like company stuff."}, {"time": 10440, "text": "And the idea that Spotify is different than pirate radio, the difficult thing about podcasting is nobody gives a damn about your podcast."}, {"time": 10450, "text": "You're alone in this."}, {"time": 10451, "text": "I mean, there's fans and stuff, but nobody."}, {"time": 10454, "text": "Nobody's looking out for you."}, {"time": 10455, "text": "And the nice thing about Spotify is they want Joe's podcast to succeed even more."}, {"time": 10461, "text": "That's what Joe talked about is that's the difference between YouTube and Spotify."}, {"time": 10467, "text": "Spotify wants to be the Netflix of podcasting."}, {"time": 10470, "text": "And they, like what Netflix does is they don't want to control you in any way, but they want to create a platform where you can flourish."}, {"time": 10481, "text": "Because your interests are aligned."}, {"time": 10482, "text": "Interests are aligned."}, {"time": 10483, "text": "So let me bring up something that, let's make a distinction because not all companies who do this are the same."}, {"time": 10490, "text": "And you brought up YouTube and Spotify, but to me, YouTube is at least more like Spotify than some of these smaller."}, {"time": 10496, "text": "The term is walled garden, right?"}, {"time": 10498, "text": "You've heard the term walled garden?"}, {"time": 10500, "text": "So I've been around podcasting so long now that I've seen rounds of consolidation over the years and they come in waves and all of a sudden, so you'll get, and I'm not going to mention any names, but up until recently, the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms compared to people like Spotify."}, {"time": 10518, "text": "And the problem was, is that by deciding to consolidate your materials in a walled garden, you are walling yourself off from audience, right?"}, {"time": 10528, "text": "So your choice is I'm going to accept this amount of money from this company, but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience."}, {"time": 10533, "text": "And that's a catch 22 because you're negotiating power with that company is based on your audience size."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "So signing up with them diminishes your audience size, you lose negotiating power."}, {"time": 10543, "text": "But when you get to the level of the Spotify to just pick them out, there's other players, but you brought up Spotify specifically, these are people who can potentially, potentially enhance your audience over time."}, {"time": 10587, "text": "So it takes away some of the downside risk, which alleviates, and if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan, I mean, where you've protected your freedom to put the content out the way you want."}, {"time": 10599, "text": "So, and if some of the downside risk is mitigated, and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize and stay up with the latest tech, then it might be worth it."}, {"time": 10609, "text": "You know, I'm scared of things like that, but at the same time, I'm trying to not be an idiot about it, and I can be an idiot about it."}, {"time": 10616, "text": "And when you've been doing it as independently for as long as I have, the inertia of that has a force all its own, but I'm inhibited enough in what I'm trying to do on this other end, that it's opened me at least to listening to people."}, {"time": 10634, "text": "But listen, at the same time, I love my audience, and it sounds like a cliche, but they're literally the reason I'm here."}, {"time": 10643, "text": "So I wanna make sure that whatever I do, if I can, is in keeping with a relationship that I've developed with these people over 15 years."}, {"time": 10654, "text": "But like you said, no matter what you do, you are, because see, here's the thing."}, {"time": 10658, "text": "If you don't sign up with one of those companies to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand, they might yell at you for how difficult it is, because the new operating system just updated, and you said, I can't get your stuff."}, {"time": 10669, "text": "So either way, you're opening yourself up to ridicule at this point."}, {"time": 10672, "text": "All of that makes it easier to go, well, if the right deal came along, and they weren't screwing me, and they weren't screwing my audience, and blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 10680, "text": "I mean, again, in this business, when you're talking about cutting edge technology that is ever changing, and as you said, a million podcasts and growing, I think you have to try to maintain flexibility, and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk, I think you'd be an idiot to not at least try to stay up on the current trends."}, {"time": 10700, "text": "And look, I'm watching Joe."}, {"time": 10702, "text": "I'm going, okay, let's see how it goes for Joe."}, {"time": 10704, "text": "I mean, if he's like, ah, this is terrible, I'm getting out of this, you go, okay, those people are off the list."}, {"time": 10709, "text": "So Joe's put himself out as a guinea pig, and the rest of us guinea pigs appreciate it."}, {"time": 10714, "text": "As a huge, as a fan of your show, and as a fan of Netflix, the people there, I think I can speak for like millions of people in hope that hardcore history comes to Netflix, or if Spotify becomes the Netflix of podcasting, then to Spotify."}, {"time": 10730, "text": "There's something at its best that they bring out the, you said artists, so I can say it, is they bring out the best out of the artists."}, {"time": 10739, "text": "They remove some of the headache, and somehow like they put at their best, Netflix, for example, is able to enforce and find the beauty and the power in the creations that you make even better than you."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "Like they don't interfere with the creations, but they somehow, it's a branding thing probably too."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "Yeah, but interfering would be, that would be a no go for me."}, {"time": 10766, "text": "That's right, absolutely."}, {"time": 10768, "text": "That can't happen."}, {"time": 10768, "text": "But that's why Netflix is masterful."}, {"time": 10771, "text": "They seem to not interfere with the talent, as opposed to, I could throw other people under the bus, like Amazon."}, {"time": 10777, "text": "There's a lot of places under the bus that could be thrown, absolutely."}, {"time": 10779, "text": "So I would love, I know there's probably people screaming yes right now."}, {"time": 10783, "text": "In terms of hardcore history on Netflix, it would be awesome."}, {"time": 10786, "text": "And I don't love asking this question, but it's asked probably the most popular question that's unanswerable."}, {"time": 10797, "text": "So let me try to ask it in a way that you would actually answer it, which is, of course, you said you don't release shows very often."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "And the question is, or the requests and the questions is, well, can you tell Dan to do one on the Civil War?"}, {"time": 10811, "text": "Can you tell Dan to do one on the Napoleon Bonaparte?"}, {"time": 10814, "text": "Can you tell him to do one?"}, {"time": 10816, "text": "Every topic, and you've spoken to this."}, {"time": 10818, "text": "Actually, your answer about the Civil War is quite interesting."}, {"time": 10821, "text": "I didn't know you knew what my answer about the Civil War was."}, {"time": 10824, "text": "As a military historian, you enjoy, in particular, when there is differences in the armies, as opposed to contrasts."}, {"time": 10832, "text": "With the Civil War, which blew my mind when I heard you say there's not an interesting, a deep, intricate contrast between the two opposing sides."}, {"time": 10842, "text": "It's like the Roman Civil Wars, where it's legionary against legionary."}, {"time": 10845, "text": "And you've also said that the shows you work on are ones where you have some roots of fundamental understanding about that period."}, {"time": 10854, "text": "And so, when you work on a show, it's basically pulling at those strings further and refreshing your mind and learning."}, {"time": 10862, "text": "You have definitely done the research."}, {"time": 10864, "text": "Wow, these are words out of my mouth."}, {"time": 10867, "text": "But is there something like shower thoughts on Reddit?"}, {"time": 10872, "text": "Is there some ideas that are lingering in your head about possible future episodes?"}, {"time": 10879, "text": "Is there things that, whether you're not committing to anything, but whether you're gonna do it or not, is there something that makes you think, hmm, that'll be interesting to pull at that thread a little bit?"}, {"time": 10895, "text": "Oh yeah, we have things we keep in our back pocket for later."}, {"time": 10899, "text": "So, Blueprint for Armageddon, the first World War series we did, that was in my back pocket the whole time."}, {"time": 10904, "text": "And when the centennial of the war happened, it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was."}, {"time": 10910, "text": "That was a hell

matters."}, {"time": 774, "text": "It matters more than almost anything."}, {"time": 777, "text": "And not everything, but almost anything."}, {"time": 779, "text": "And so as a result, you have to

2002."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "He got to Georgia Tech in 2002."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "And worked on things like revamping the curriculum, the undergraduate curriculum, so that it had some kind

could you do?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "And being able to do something with another person was that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "I mean, you can take turns, but teaching together, having conversations is very hard."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So that was a cool thing."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "The second thing, give me an excuse to do more stuff with him."}, {"time": 2832, "text":

saying, and it would be great if Michael could teach the course and I could just hang out."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Yeah, just kind of coast on that."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "Well, that's what the second class was more like that."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "Because the second class was explicitly like that."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "But the first class, it was at least half."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "Yeah, but I do all the stuff."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So the structure that we came up with."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "I think you're once again letting the facts get in the way of a good story."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "I should just let Charles talk to us."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But that's the facts that he saw."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So that was kind of true for 7642."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "Yeah, that was sort of true for 7642, which is the reinforcement learning class, because that was really his class."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "You started with reinforcement learning or machine learning?"}, {"time": 2875, "text": "Intro machine learning, 7641, which is supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning and decision making, cram all that in there, the kind of assignments that we talked about earlier."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "And then eventually, about a year later, we did a follow on 7642, which is reinforcement learning and decision making."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "The first class was based on something I'd been teaching at that point for well over a decade."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "And the second class was based on something Michael had been teaching."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "Actually, I learned quite a bit teaching that class with him, but he drove most of that."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "But the first one I drove most, it was all my material."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Although I had stolen that material originally from slides I found online from Michael, who had originally stolen that material from, I guess, slides he found online, probably from Andrew Moore, because the jokes were the same anyway."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "At least some of the, at least when I found the slides, some of the stuff with it."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "Yes, every machine learning class taught in the early 2000s stole from Andrew Moore."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "A particular joke or two?"}, {"time": 2923, "text": "At least the structure."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "Now, I did, and he did, actually, a lot more with reinforcement learning and such, and game theory and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "But, you know, we all sort of built in."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "You mean in the research world?"}, {"time": 2932, "text": "No, no, no, in that class."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "No, I mean in teaching that class."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "The coverage was different than what we started."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "Most people were just doing supervised learning and maybe a little bit of clustering and whatnot, but we took it all the way to machine learning."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell's book."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Oh, no, yeah, except, well, half of it comes from Tom Mitchell's book, right?"}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I mean, the other half doesn't."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "This is why it's all readings, right?"}, {"time": 2952, "text": "Because certain things weren't invented when Tom wrote that stuff."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Yeah, okay, that's true."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "All right, but it was quite good."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "But there's a reason for that besides, you know, just, I wanted to do it."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I wanted to do something new, and I wanted to do something with him, which is a realization, which is despite what you might believe, he's an introvert and I'm an introvert, or I'm on the edge of being an introvert anyway."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd, right?"}, {"time": 2977, "text": "There's something about talking to people and bringing them into whatever we find interesting that is empowering, energizing, or whatever."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen and then talking off of materials less inspiring than I wanted it to be."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And I had in fact done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And it was a week in a dark room talking at the screen, writing on the little pad."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And I didn't know this was happening, but they had watched, the crew had watched some of the videos while, you know, like in the middle of this, and they're like, something's wrong."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "You're sort of shutting down."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "And I think a lot of it was I'll make jokes and no one would laugh."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "And I felt like the crowd hated me."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Now, of course, there was no crowd."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So like, it wasn't rational."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "But each time I tried it and I got no reaction, it just was taking the energy out of my performance, out of my presentation."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Anyway, by working together, we could play off each other and have a good time."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And keep the energy up, because you can't let your guard down for a moment with Charles, he'll just overpower you."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "But we would work really well together, I thought, and we knew each other, so I knew that we could sort of make it work."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "Plus, I was the associate dean, so they had to do what I told them to do."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "We had to make it work."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "And so it worked out very well, I thought, well enough that we."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "With great power comes great power."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "And we became smooth and curly."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And that's when we did the overfitting thriller video."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "Yeah, that's a thing."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "So can we just, like, smooth and curly, where did that come from?"}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Okay, so it happened."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "It was completely spontaneous."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "These are nicknames you go by."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "Yeah, so it's what the students call us."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "He was lecturing."},

up a little Prisoner's Dilemma grid."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So he drew it and I could see what he was drawing."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "And the Prisoner's Dilemma consists of two players, two parties."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So he decided he would make little cartoons of the two of us."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "And so there was two criminals, right, that were deciding whether or not to rat each other out."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "One of them he drew as a circle with a smiley face and a kind of goatee thing, smooth head."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "And the other one with all sorts of curly hair."}, {"time": 3136, "text": "And he said, this is smooth and curly."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "I said, smooth and curly?"}, {"time": 3139, "text": "He said, no, no, smooth with a V.

it."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "So you mentioned disaggregation."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "So what's that?"}, {"time": 4326, "text": "Well, so the power of technology that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough is all about we're gonna disaggregate these things together."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "The books from the bookstore, that kind of a thing."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe, right?"}, {"time": 4337, "text": "And technology is a disruptor, right?"}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And people have been predicting that for higher education for

happening."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "But I feel like you didn't address that."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Why, why, why is it that, why, why?"}, {"time": 4382, "text": "I don't think that will be the

around."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "A large part of it is peers."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Well, it's peers and independence."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Yeah, but none of that, you can do classes online for all of that."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "No, no, no, no, because we're social people, right?"}, {"time": 4400, "text": "So you wanna be in the same room."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "So when we take the classes, that also has to be part of an experience."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "It's in a context, and the context is the university."}, {"time": 4407, "text": "And by the way, it actually matters that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "I see, because then students can choose the kind of experience they think is gonna be best for them."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "Okay, I think we're giving too much agency to the students in making an informed decision."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "But the truth, but yes, they will make choices and they will have different experiences."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "And some of those choices will be made for them."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "Some of them will be choices they're making because they think it's this, that, or the other."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "I just don't want to say, I don't want to give the idea."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "It's not homogenous."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "Yes, it's certainly

okay?"}, {"time": 4445, "text": "Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "But these are all different."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "They have different contexts."},

a small campus or a large campus."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "I mean, these things matter."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech, you're forever proud of that, and you say

say that."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "So the students who take our online masters by several measures are more loyal than the students who come on campus, certainly for the master's degree."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "The reason for that, I think, and you'd have to ask them, but based on my conversations with them, I feel comfortable saying this, is because this didn't exist before."}, {"time": 4518,

it while I'm working full time, and I've got a family and a mortgage and all these other things."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "So it's an opportunity to do something you wanted to do, but you didn't think was possible without giving up two years of your life, as well as all the money and everything else in the life that you had built."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "So I think we created something that's had an impact, but importantly, we gave a set of people opportunities they otherwise didn't feel they had."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "So I think people feel very loyal about that."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And my biggest piece of evidence for that, besides the surveys, is that we have somewhere north of 80 students, might be 100 at this point, who graduated, but come back in TA for this class, for basically minimum wage, even though they're working full time, because they believe in sort of having that opportunity and they wanna be a part of something."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Now, will generation three feel this way?"}, {"time": 4585, "text": "15 years from now, will people have that same sense?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "I don't know, but right now they kind of do."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And so it's not the online, it's a matter of feeling as if you're a part of something."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "Right, we're all very tribal, right?"}, {"time": 4599, "text": "And I think there's something very tribal about being a part of something like that."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "Being on campus makes that easier, going through a shared experience makes that easier."},

"text": "But is it possible?"}, {"time": 4614, "text": "It is possible."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "The question is, it still is the intuition to me, and it was at the beginning when I saw something like the online master's program, is that this is gonna replace universities."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "No, it won't replace universities."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "But like why?"}, {"time": 4631, "text": "Because it's living in a different part of the ecosystem, right?"}, {"time": 4633, "text": "The people who are taking it are already adults, they've gone through their undergrad experience."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "They have other things that are going on."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "But it does do something really important, something very social and very important, right?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "You know this whole thing about, don't build the sidewalks, just leave the grass and the

things."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "The metaphor here is that we created this environment, we didn't quite know how to think about the social aspect, but we didn't have time to solve all, do all the social engineering, right?"}, {"time": 4673, "text": "The students did it themselves, they created these groups, like on Google Plus, there were like 30 something groups created in the first year because somebody had used Google Plus."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "And they created these groups and they divided up in ways that made sense."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "We live in the same state or we're working on the same things or we have the same background or whatever and they created these social things."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "We sent them T shirts and they wear, we have all these great pictures of students putting on their T shirts as they travel around the world."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "I climbed this mountain top, I'm putting this T shirt on, I'm a part of this, they were a part of them."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "They created the social environment on top of the social network and the social media that existed to create this sense of belonging and being a part of something."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "They found a way to do it, right?"}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And I think they had other, it scratched an itch that they had, but they had scratched some of that itch that might've required they'd be physically in the same place long before, right?"}, {"time": 4724, "text": "So I think, yes, it's possible and it's more than possible, it's necessary."},

there's just a lot of power in the kind of rite of passage kind of going off to yourself."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "Now, maybe there'll be some other rite of passage that'll happen."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "That'll drive us somewhere else, it's possible."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So the university is such a fascinating mess of things."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Like it doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "It's stabilized itself, but like why are the world class researchers spending a huge amount of time or their time teaching and service?"}, {"time": 4767, "text": "Like you're doing like three jobs."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And I mean, it turns out it's maybe an accident of history or human evolution, I don't know."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "It seems like the people who are really good at teaching are often really good at research."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "There seems to be a parallel

speaking, it's a safe space."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "Now, by the way, I feel the need very strongly to point out that we are living in a very particular weird bubble, right?"}, {"time": 4809,

something."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "I forget the numbers."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "The places where we've been, where we are, they look like whatever we think the traditional movie version of

reasons, right?"}, {"time": 4832, "text": "So we were talking about a particular experience."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "And so for that set of people, which is very small, but larger than it was a decade or two or three or four, certainly, ago, I don't think that will change."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "My concern, which I think is kind of implicit in some of these questions, is that somehow we will divide the world up further into the people who get to have this experience and get to have the network and they sort of benefit from it, and everyone else, while increasingly requiring that they

et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "I worry a lot about that, which is why, for me, and by the way, here's an answer to your question about faculty, which is why, to me, that you have to focus on access and the mission."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "I think the reason, whether it's good, bad, or strange, I mean, I agree, it's strange, but I think it's useful to have the faculty member, particularly at large R1 universities where we've all had experiences, that you tie what they get to do and with the fundamental mission of the university and let the mission drive."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "What I hear when I talk to faculty is, they love their PhD students because they're reproducing, basically, right?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "And it lets them do their research and multiply."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "But they understand that the mission is the undergrads, and so they will do it without complaint, mostly, because it's a part of the mission and why they're here, and they have experiences with it themselves, and it was important to get them where they were going."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "The people who tend to get squeezed in that, by the way, are the master's students, right, who are neither the PhDs who are like us nor the undergrads we have already bought into the idea that we have to teach, though."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "That's increasingly changing."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters, and it gives you a way to unify people around making it an actual higher calling."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "Education feels like more of a higher calling to me than even research, because education, you cannot treat it as a hobby if you're going to do it well."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "But that's the

although I think most of our colleagues, many of our colleagues would say that research is the job and education is the distraction."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "Right, but that's the beautiful dance."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work, seems to bring out the best in the faculty."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "But I will point out two things."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "One thing I'm going to point out, and the other thing I want Michael to point out, because I think Michael is much closer to sort of the ideal professor in some sense than I am."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "Well, he is a dean."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "You're the platonic sense of a professor."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "I don't know what he meant by that, but he is a dean,

90 or so tenure track faculty."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "Those 10 lecturers who only teach, well, they don't only teach, they also do service."}, {"time": 5022, "text": "Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours, and we teach everybody, right?"}, {"time": 5031, "text": "So they're doing not just, they're doing more than eight times the work of the tenure track faculty, just more closer to nine or 10."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And that's including our grad courses, right?"}, {"time": 5043, "text": "So

single question we asked our alum, and these are people who graduated, born in the 30s and 40s, all the way up to people who graduated last week, right?"}, {"time": 5069, "text": "Well, last semester."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "Time flies."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "Yeah, time flies."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "And it was the question, name a single person who had a strong positive impact on you, something like that."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "I think it was special impact?"}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Yeah, special impact on you."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "And then, so they got all the answers from people, and they created a word cloud."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "It was clearly a word cloud created by people who don't do word clouds for a living because they had one person whose name appeared like nine different times, like Philip, Phil, Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "But they got all this."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "And I looked at it, and I

like, you could just code in a parameter, which is how long the life ends, but more of a fear of mortality, like awareness of the way that things end and somehow encoding a complex representation of that fear, which is like, maybe as it gets closer, you become more terrified."}, {"time": 898, "text": "I mean, there seems to be something really profound about this fear that's not currently encodable in a trivial way into our programs."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Well, I think you're referring to the emotion of fear, something, because we have cognitively, we know that we have limited lifespan and most of us cope with it by just, hey, that's what the world is like and I make the most of it."}, {"time": 920, "text": "But sometimes you can have like a fear that's not healthy, that paralyzes you, that you can't do anything."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And somewhere in between there, not caring at all and getting paralyzed because of fear is a normal response, which is a little bit more than just logic and it's emotion."}, {"time": 941, "text": "So now the question is, what good are emotions?"}, {"time": 943, "text": "I mean, they are quite complex and there are multiple dimensions of emotions and they probably do serve a survival function, heightened focus, for instance."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And fear of death might be a really good emotion when you are in danger, that you recognize it, even if it's not logically necessarily easy to derive and you don't have time for that logical deduction, you may be able to recognize the situation is dangerous and this fear kicks in and you all of a sudden perceive the facts that are important for that."}, {"time": 978, "text": "And I think that's generally is the role of emotions."}, {"time": 981, "text": "It allows you to focus what's relevant for your situation."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And maybe if fear of death plays the same kind of role, but if it consumes you and it's something that you think in normal life when you don't have to, then it's not healthy and then it's not productive."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Yeah, but it's fascinating to think how to incorporate emotion into a computational agent."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "It almost seems like a silly statement to make, but it perhaps seems silly because we have such a poor understanding of the mechanism of emotion, of fear, of, I think at the core of it is another word that we know nothing about, but say a lot, which is consciousness."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Do you ever in your work, or like maybe on a coffee break, think about what the heck is this thing consciousness and is it at all useful in our thinking about AI systems?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Yes, it is an important question."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You can build representations and functions, I think into these agents that act like emotions and consciousness perhaps."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So I mentioned emotions being something that allow you to focus and pay attention, filter out what's important."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Yeah, you can have that kind of a filter mechanism and it puts you in a different state."}, {"time": 1060, "text":

modeling hyenas who were trying to steal a kill from lions, which happens in Africa."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "I mean, hyenas are quite intelligent, but not really intelligent."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And they have this behavior that's more complex than anything else they do."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "They can band together, if there's about 30 of them or so, they can coordinate their effort so that they push the lions away from a kill."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Even though the lions are so strong that they could kill a hyena by striking with a paw."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "But when they work together and precisely time this attack, the lions will leave and they get the kill."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And probably there are some states like emotions that the hyenas go through."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The first, they call for reinforcements."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "They really want that kill, but there's not enough of them."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So they vocalize and there's more people, more hyenas that come around."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then they have two emotions."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "They're very afraid of the lion, so they want to stay away, but they also have a strong affiliation between each other."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And then this is the balance of the two emotions."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And also, yes, they also want the kill."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So it's both repelled and attractive."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "But then this affiliation eventually is so strong that when they move, they move together, they act as a unit and they can perform that function."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So there's an interesting behavior that seems to depend on these emotions strongly and makes it possible, coordinate the actions."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And I think a critical aspect of that, the way you're describing is emotion there is a mechanism of social communication, of a social interaction."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Maybe humans won't even be that intelligent or most things we think of as intelligent wouldn't be that intelligent without the social component of interaction."}, {"time": 1187, "text":

social systems."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "Yes, I strongly believe that's true."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And yes, the communication is multifaceted."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I mean, they vocalize and call for friends, but they also rub against each other and they push and they do all kinds of gestures and so on."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So they don't act alone."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "And I don't think people act alone very much either, at least normal, most of the time."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And social systems are so strong for humans that I think we build everything on top of these kinds of structures."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And one interesting theory around that, bigotness theory, for instance, for language, but language origins is that where did language come from?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And it's a plausible theory that first came social systems, that you have different roles in a society."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And then those roles are exchangeable, that I scratch your back, you scratch my back, we can exchange roles."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And once you have the brain structures that allow you to understand actions in terms of roles that can be changed, that's the basis for language, for grammar."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "And now you can start using symbols to refer to objects in the world."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And you have this flexible structure."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So there's a social structure that's fundamental for language to develop."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Now, again, then you have language, you can refer to things that are not here right now."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "And that allows you to then build all the good stuff about planning, for instance, and building things and so on."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So yeah, I think that very strongly humans are social and that gives us ability to structure the world."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "But also as a society, we can do so much more because one person does not have to do everything."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "You can have different roles and together achieve a lot more."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And that's also something we see in computational simulations today."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "I mean, we have multi agent systems that can perform tasks."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "This fascinating demonstration, Marco Dorego, I think it was, these little robots that had to navigate through an environment and there were things that are dangerous, like maybe a big chasm or some kind of groove, a hole, and they could not get across it."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "But if they grab each other with their gripper, they formed a robot that was much longer under the team and this way they could get across that."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "So this is a great example of how together we can achieve things we couldn't otherwise."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Like the hyenas, you know, alone they couldn't, but as a team they could."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And I think humans do that all the time."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "We're really good at that."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Yeah, and the way you described the system of hyenas, it almost sounds algorithmic."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Like the problem with humans is they're so complex, it's hard to think of them as algorithms."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "But with hyenas, there's a, it's simple enough to where it feels like, at least hopeful that it's possible to create computational systems that mimic that."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Yeah, that's exactly why we looked at that."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "As opposed to humans."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Like I said, they are intelligent, but they are not quite as intelligent as say, baboons, which would learn a lot and would be much more flexible."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "The hyenas are relatively rigid in what they can do."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And therefore you could look at this behavior, like this is a breakthrough in evolution about to happen."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That they've discovered something about social structures, communication, about cooperation, and it might then spill over to other things too in thousands of years in the future."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Yeah, I think the problem with baboons and humans is probably too much is going on inside the head."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "We won't be able to measure it if we're observing the system."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "With hyenas, it's probably easier to observe the actual decision making and the various motivations that are involved."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Yeah, they are visible."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And we can even quantify possibly their emotional state because they leave droppings behind."},

last 24 hours."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "What to you is the most beautiful, speaking of hyenas, what to you is the most beautiful nature inspired algorithm in your work that you've come across?"},

fascinates me most is that with computers is that you can get more out than you put in."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I mean, you can write a piece of code and your machine does what you told it."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I mean, this happened to me in my freshman year."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "It did something very simple and I was just amazed."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "I was blown away that it would get the number and it would compute the result."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "And I didn't have to do it myself."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "But if you push that a little further, you can have machines that learn and they might learn patterns."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And already say deep learning neural networks, they can learn to recognize objects, sounds, patterns that humans have trouble with."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And sometimes they do it better than humans."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And that's so fascinating."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And now if you take that one more step, you get something like evolutionary algorithms that discover things, they create things, they come up with solutions that you did not think of."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And that just blows me away."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "It's so great that we can build systems, algorithms that can be in some sense smarter than we are, that they can discover solutions that we might miss."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "A lot of times it is because we have as humans, we have certain biases, we expect the solutions to be certain way and you don't put those biases into the algorithm so they are more free to explore."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And evolution is just absolutely fantastic explorer."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "And that's what really is fascinating."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Yeah, I think I get made fun of a bit because I currently don't have any kids, but you mentioned programs."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "I mean, do you have kids?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So maybe you could speak to this, but there's a magic to the creative process."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "Like with Spot, the Boston Dynamics Spot, but really any robot that I've ever worked on, it just feels like the similar kind of joy I imagine I would have as a father."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Not the same perhaps level, but like the same kind of wonderment."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Like there's exactly this, which is like you know what you had to do initially to get this thing going."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Let's speak on the computer science side, like what the program looks like, but something about it doing more than what the program was written on paper is like that somehow connects to the magic of this entire universe."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "Like that's like, I feel like I found God."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Every time I like, it's like, because you've really created something that's living."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Even if it's a simple program."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "It has a life of its own, it has the intelligence of its own."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "It's beyond what you actually thought."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And that is, I think it's exactly spot on."},

point."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So in that sense, I think it's, that may be part of the joy actually."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But you mentioned creativity in this context, especially in the context of evolutionary computation."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "So, we don't often think of algorithms as creative."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So how do you think about creativity?"}, {"time": 1641,

defined."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "A couple of requirements has to be new."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It has to be useful and it has to be surprising."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And those certainly are true with, say, evolutionary computation discovering solutions."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "So maybe an example, for instance, we did this collaboration with MIT Media Lab, Caleb Harbus Lab, where they had a hydroponic food computer, they called it, environment that was completely computer controlled, nutrients, water, light, temperature, everything is controlled."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Now, what do you do if you can control everything?"}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Farmers know a lot about how to make plants grow in their own patch of land."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "But if you can control everything, it's too much."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And it turns out that we don't actually know very much about it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "So we built a system, evolutionary optimization system, together with a surrogate model of how plants grow and let this system explore recipes on its own."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And initially, we were focusing on light, how strong, what wavelengths, how long the light was on."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And we put some boundaries which we thought were reasonable."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "For instance, that there was at least six hours of darkness, like night, because that's what we have in the world."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And very quickly, the system, evolution, pushed all the recipes to that limit."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "We were trying to grow basil."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And we initially had some 200, 300 recipes, exploration as well as known recipes."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "But now we are going beyond that."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "And everything was pushed to that limit."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "So we look at it and say, well, we can easily just change it."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Let's have it your way."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And it turns out the system discovered that basil does not need to sleep."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "24 hours, lights on, and it will thrive."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "It will be bigger, it will be tastier."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "And this was a big surprise, not just to us, but also the biologists in the team that anticipated that there are some constraints that are in the world for a reason."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "It turns out that evolution did not have the same bias."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And therefore, it discovered something that was creative."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "It was surprising, it was useful, and it was new."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "That's fascinating to think about the things we think that are fundamental to living systems on Earth today, whether they're actually fundamental or they somehow fit the constraints of the system."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And all we have to do is just remove the constraints."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Do you ever think about, I don't know how much you know about brain computer interfaces in your link."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "The idea there is our brains are very limited."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And if we just allow, we plug in, we provide a mechanism for a computer to speak with the brain."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So you're thereby expanding the computational power of the brain."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "The possibilities there, from a very high level philosophical perspective, is limitless."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "But I wonder how limitless it is."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Are the constraints we have features that are fundamental to our intelligence?"}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Or is this just this weird constraint in terms of our brain size and skull and lifespan and senses?"}, {"time": 1844, "text": "It's just the weird little quirk of evolution."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And if we just open that up, like add much more senses, add much more computational power, the intelligence will expand exponentially."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Do you have a sense about constraints, the relationship of evolution and computation to the constraints of the environment?"}, {"time": 1869, "text": "Well, at first I'd like to comment on that, like changing the inputs to human brain."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And flexibility of the brain."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "I think there's a lot of that."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "There are experiments that are done in animals like Mikangazuru at MIT, switching the auditory and visual information and going to the wrong part of the cortex."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And the animal was still able to hear and perceive the visual environment."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "And there are kids that are born with severe disorders and sometimes they have to remove half of the brain, like one half, and they still grow up."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "They have the functions migrate to the other parts."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "There's a lot of flexibility like that."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So I think it's quite possible to hook up the brain with different kinds of sensors, for instance, and something that we don't even quite understand or have today on different kinds of wavelengths or whatever they are."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "And then the brain can learn to make sense of it."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "And that I think is this good hope that these prosthetic devices, for instance, work, not because we make them so good and so easy to use, but the brain adapts to them and can learn to take advantage of them."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And so in that sense, if there's a trouble, a problem, I think the brain can be used to correct it."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "Now going beyond what we have today, can you get smarter?"}, {"time": 1949, "text": "That's really much harder to do."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Giving the brain more input probably might overwhelm it."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "It would have to learn to filter it and focus and in order to use the information effectively and augmenting intelligence with some kind of external devices like that might be difficult, I think."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "But replacing what's lost, I think is quite possible."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Right, so our intuition allows us to sort of imagine that we can replace what's been lost, but expansion beyond what we have, I mean, we're already one of the most, if not the most intelligent things on this earth, right?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So it's hard to imagine."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "But if the brain can hold up with an order of magnitude greater set of information thrown at it, if it can do, if it can reason through that."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Part of me, this is the Russian thing, I think, is I tend to think that the limitations is where the superpower is, that immortality and a huge increase in bandwidth of information by connecting computers with the brain is not going to produce greater intelligence."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "It might produce lesser intelligence."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "So I don't know, there's something about the scarcity being essential to fitness or performance, but that could be just because we're so limited."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "No, exactly, you make do with what you have, but you don't have to be a genius but you don't have to pipe it directly to the brain."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "I mean, we already have devices like phones where we can look up information at any point."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And that can make us more productive."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "You don't have to argue about, I don't know, what happened in that baseball game or whatever it is, because you can look it up right away."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "And I think in that sense, we can learn to utilize tools."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "And that's what we have been doing for a long, long time."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "And we are already, the brain is already drinking the water, firehose, like vision."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "There's way more information in vision that we actually process."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So brain is already good at identifying what matters."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that we can switch that from vision to some other wavelength or some other kind of modality."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "But I think that the same processing principles probably still apply."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "But also indeed this ability to have information more accessible and more relevant, I think can enhance what we do."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "I mean, kids today at school, they learn about DNA."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "I mean, things that were discovered just a couple of years ago."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "And it's already common knowledge and we are building on it."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "And we don't see a problem where there's too much information that we can absorb and learn."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "Maybe people become a little bit more narrow in what they know, they are in one field."}, {"time": 2120,

point of saturation."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "We have still this process that allows us to be selective and decide what's interesting, I think still works even with the more information we have today."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Yeah, it's fascinating to think about like Wikipedia becoming a sensor."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "Like, so the fire hose of information from Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "So it's like you integrated directly into the brain to where you're thinking, like you're observing the world with all of Wikipedia directly piping into your brain."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So like when I see a light, I immediately have like the history of who invented electricity, like integrated very quickly into."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So just the way you think about the

think it's wonderful."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "I think it's great that we could do something like that."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "I mean, there are devices that read your EEG for instance, and humans can learn to control things using just their thoughts in that sense."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "And I don't think it's that different."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "I mean, those signals would go to limbs, they would go to thumbs."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Now the same signals go through a sensor to some computing system."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "It still probably has to be built on human terms, not to overwhelm them, but utilize what's there and sense the right kind of patterns that are easy to generate."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "But, oh, that I think is really quite possible and wonderful and could be very much more efficient."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Is there, so you mentioned surprising being a characteristic of creativity."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "Is there something,

account necessarily like there's folding and interactions that are other than just the sequence itself."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "And lots of that is not yet captured and we don't know whether they are really crucial."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "Evolution, biological evolution has produced wonderful things, but if you look at them, it's not necessarily the case that every piece is irreplaceable

like that that are not really that useful."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "If you try to explain them now, it would make no sense, very hard."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "But if you think of us as productive evolution, you can see where they came from."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "They were useful at one point perhaps and no longer are, but they're still there."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "So that process is complex and your representation should support it."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And that is quite difficult if we are limited with strings or trees, and then we are pretty much limited what can be constructed."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And one thing that we are still missing in evolutionary computation in particular is what we saw in biology, major transitions."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So that you go from, for instance, single cell to multi cell organisms and eventually societies."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "There are transitions of level of selection and level of what a unit is."},

2670, "text": "Is that what that is?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Most likely it does, but it's quite, we don't even understand it in biology very well where it's coming from."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "So it would be really good to look at major transitions in biology, try to characterize them a little bit more in detail, what the processes are."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "How does a, so like a unit, a cell is no longer evaluated alone."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "It's evaluated as part of a community, a multi cell organism."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "Even though it could reproduce, now it can't alone."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "It has to have that environment."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "So there's a push to another level, at least a selection."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "And how do you make that jump to the next level?"}, {"time": 2704, "text": "Yes, how do you make the jump?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "As part of the algorithm."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "So we haven't really seen that in computation yet."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "And there are certainly attempts to have open ended evolution."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Things that could add more complexity and start selecting at a higher level."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But it is still not quite the same as going from single to multi to society, for instance, in biology."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So there essentially would be, as opposed to having one agent, those agent all of a sudden spontaneously decide to then be together."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "And then your entire system would then be treating them as one agent."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "Some kind of weird merger building."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "But also, so you mentioned, I think you mentioned selection."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "So basically there's an agent and they don't get to live on if they don't do well."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "So there's some kind of measure of what doing well is and isn't."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "And does mutation come into play at all in the process and what in the world does it serve?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Yeah, so, and again, back to what the computational mechanisms of evolution computation are."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "So the way to create variation, you can take multiple individuals, two usually, but you could do more."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And you exchange the parts of the representation."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "You do some kind of recombination."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Could be crossover, for instance."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "In biology, you do have DNA strings that are cut and put together again."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "We could do something like that."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And it seems to be that in biology, the crossover is really the workhorse in biological evolution."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "In computation, we tend to rely more on mutation."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "And that is making random changes into parts of the

years."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "I mean, evolution computation has been around for 50 years, but a lot of the recent..."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Success comes from mutation."}, {"time": 2836,

computation."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "And in that sense, it has diverged a bit from biological evolution."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And that's one of the things I think we could look at again, having a weaker selection, more crossover, large populations, more time, and maybe a different kind of creativity would come out of it."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "We are very impatient in evolution computation today."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "We want answers right now, right, quickly."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And if somebody doesn't perform, kill it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And biological evolution doesn't work quite that way."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And it's more patient."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Yes, much more patient."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So I guess we need to add some kind of mating, some kind of like dating mechanisms, like marriage maybe in there."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "So into our algorithms to improve the combination as opposed to all mutation doing all of the work."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Yeah, and many ways of being successful."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "Usually in evolution computation, we have one goal, play this game really well compared to others."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "But in biology, there are many ways of being successful."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "You can build niches."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "You can be stronger, faster, larger, or smarter, or eat this or eat that."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So there are many ways to solve the same problem of survival."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "And that then breeds creativity."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "And it allows more exploration."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "And eventually you get solutions that are perhaps more creative rather than trying to go from initial population directly or more or less directly to your maximum fitness, which you measure as just one metric."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So in a broad sense, before we talk about neuroevolution, do you see evolutionary computation as more effective than deep learning in a certain context?"}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Machine learning, broadly speaking."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Maybe even supervised machine learning."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "I don't know if you want to draw any kind of lines and distinctions and borders where they rub up against each other kind of thing, where one is more effective than the other in the current state of things."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Yes, of course, they are very different and they address different kinds of problems."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "And the deep learning has been really successful in domains where we have a lot of data."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And that means not just data about situations, but also what the right answers were."},

today and what it will be tomorrow."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So they are very effective deep learning methods on that kind of tasks."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "But there are other kinds of tasks where we don't really know what the right answer is."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Game playing, for instance, but many robotics tasks and actions in the world, decision making and actual practical applications, like treatments and healthcare or investment in stock market."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Many tasks are like that."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We don't know and we'll never know what the

don't and get stronger."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "And then that's how you learn."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "And evolution is also a mechanism like that at a different timescale because you have a population, not an individual during his lifetime, but an entire population as a whole can discover what works."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "And there you can afford individuals that don't work out."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "They will, you know, everybody dies and you have a next generation and they will be better than the previous one."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "So that's the big difference between these methods."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "They apply to different kinds of problems."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And in particular, there's often a comparison that's kind of interesting and important between reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "And initially, reinforcement learning was about individual learning during their lifetime."}, {"time":

apply to different kinds of problems."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And now that boundary is starting to blur a bit."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "You can use evolution as an online method and reinforcement learning to create engineering solutions, but that's still roughly the distinction."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "And from the point of view of what algorithm you wanna use, if you have something where there is a cost for every trial, reinforcement learning might be your choice."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "Now, if you have a domain where you can use a surrogate perhaps, so you don't have much of a cost for trial, and you want to have surprises, you want to explore more broadly, then this population based method is perhaps a better choice because you can try things out that you wouldn't afford

computation?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Yeah, yeah, very much."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And indeed, there are fascinating videos of that."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "And that's actually one of the examples where you can contrast the difference."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Between reinforcement learning and evolution."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Yes, so if you have a reinforcement learning agent, it tries to be conservative because it wants to walk as long as possible and be stable."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "But if you have evolutionary computation, it can afford these agents that go haywire."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "They fall flat on their face and they could take a step and then they jump and then again fall flat."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "And eventually what comes out of that is something like a falling that's controlled."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "You take another step and another step and you no longer fall."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "Instead you run, you go fast."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "So that's a way of discovering something that's hard to discover step by step incrementally."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Because you can afford these evolutionist dead ends, although they are not entirely dead ends in the sense that they can serve as stepping stones."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "When you take two of those, put them together, you get something that works even better."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "And that is a great example of this kind of discovery."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "Yeah, learning to walk is fascinating."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "I talked quite a bit to Russ Tedrick who's at MIT."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "There's a community of folks who just roboticists who love the elegance and beauty of movement."}, {"time": 3249, "text":

3281, "text": "I wonder what other spaces where you have to discover those kinds of things in."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "Yeah, another interesting direction is learning for virtual creatures, learning to walk."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "We did a study in simulation, obviously, that you create those creatures, not just their controller, but also their body."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So you have cylinders, you have muscles, you have joints and sensors, and you're creating creatures that look quite different."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "Some of them have multiple legs."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "Some of them have no legs at all."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And then the goal was to get them to move, to walk, to run."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "And what was interesting is that when you evolve the controller together with the body, you get movements that look natural because they're optimized for that physical setup."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And these creatures, you start believing them that they're alive because they walk in a way that you would expect somebody with that kind of a setup to walk."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "Yeah, there's something subjective also about that, right?"}, {"time": 3343, "text": "I've been thinking a lot about that, especially in the human robot interaction context."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "You know, I mentioned Spot, the Boston Dynamics robot."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "There is something about human robot communication."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "Let's say, let's put it in another context, something about human and dog context, like a living dog, where there's a dance of communication."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "First of all, the eyes, you both look at the same thing and the dogs communicate with their eyes as well."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "Like if you're a human, if you and a dog want to deal with a particular object, you will look at the person, the dog will look at you and then look at the object and look back at you, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "But there's also just the elegance of movement."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "I mean, there's the, of course, the tail and all those kinds of mechanisms of communication and it all seems natural and often joyful."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And for robots to communicate that, it's really difficult how to figure that out because it's almost seems impossible to hard code in."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "You can hard code it for demo purpose or something like that, but it's essentially choreographed."}, {"time": 3418, "text": "Like if you watch some of the Boston Dynamics videos where they're dancing, all of that is choreographed by human beings."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "But to learn how to, with your movement, demonstrate a naturalness and elegance, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "Of course, in the physical space, that's very difficult to do to learn the kind of scale that you're referring to, but the hope is that you could do that in simulation and then transfer it into the physical space if you're able to model the robot sufficiently naturally."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "Yeah, and sometimes I think that that requires a theory of mind on the side of the robot that they understand what you're doing because they themselves are doing something similar."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And that's a big question too."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "We talked about intelligence in general and the social aspect of intelligence."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And I think that's what is required that we humans understand other humans because we assume that they are similar to us."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "We have one simulation we did a while ago."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "Ken Stanley did that."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Two robots that were competing simulation, like I said, they were foraging for food to gain energy."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "And then when they were really strong, they would bounce into the other robot and win if they were stronger."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "And we watched evolution discover more and more complex behaviors."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "They first went to the nearest food and then they started to plot a trajectory so they get more, but then they started to pay attention what the other robot was doing."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "And in the end, there was a behavior where one of the robots, the most sophisticated one, sensed where the food pieces were and identified that the other robot was close to two of a very far distance and there was one more food nearby."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So it faked, now I'm using anthropomorphizing terms, but it made a move towards those other pieces in order for the other robot to actually go and get them because it knew that the last remaining piece of food was close and the other robot would have to travel a long way, lose its energy and then lose the whole competition."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "So there was like emergence of something like a theory of mind, knowing what the other robot would do, to guide it towards bad behavior in order to win."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "So we can get things like that happen in simulation as well."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "But that's a complete natural emergence of a theory of mind."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But I feel like if you add a little bit of a place for a theory of mind to emerge like easier, then you can go really far."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "I mean, some of these things with evolution, you know, you add a little bit of design in there, it'll really help."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "And I tend to think that a very simple theory of mind will go a really long way for cooperation between agents and certainly for human robot interaction."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "Like it doesn't have to be super complicated."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "I've gotten a chance in the autonomous vehicle space to watch vehicles interact with pedestrians or pedestrians interacting with vehicles in general."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "I mean, you would think that there's a very complicated theory of mind thing going on, but I have a sense,

human driver and a human crossing the road where the human crossing the road trusts that the human in the car is not going to murder them."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And there's something about,

currently just afraid of everything."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "They're more, they're not the kind that fall and discover how to run."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "They're more like, please don't touch

a reason and that's a solution."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And also more recently, now when we have all this deep learning literature, it turns out that we can use evolution to optimize many aspects of those designs."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "The deep learning architectures have become so complex that there's little hope for us little humans to understand their complexity and what actually makes a good design."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "And now we can use evolution to give that design for you."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "And it might mean optimizing hyperparameters, like the depth of layers and so on, or the topology of the network, how many layers, how they're connected, but also other aspects like what activation functions you use where in the network during the learning process, or what loss function you use, you could generalize that."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "You could generate that, even data augmentation, all the different aspects of the design of deep learning experiments could be optimized that way."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "So that's an interaction between two mechanisms."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "But there's also, when we get more into cognitive science and the topics that we've been talking about, you could have learning mechanisms at two level timescales."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "So you do have an evolution that gives you baby neural networks that then learn during their lifetime."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "And you have this interaction of two timescales."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "And I think that can potentially be really powerful."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Now, in biology, we are not born with all our faculties."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "We have to learn, we have a developmental period."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "In humans, it's really long and most animals have something."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "And probably the reason is that evolution of DNA is not detailed enough or plentiful enough to describe them."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "We can describe how to set the brain up, but we can, evolution can decide on a starting point and then have a learning algorithm that will construct the final product."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "And this interaction of intelligent, well, evolution that has produced a good starting point for the specific purpose of learning from it with the interaction with the environment, that can be a really powerful mechanism for constructing brains and constructing behaviors."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "I like how you walk back from intelligence."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So optimize starting point, maybe."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "Yeah, okay, there's a lot of fascinating things to ask here."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And this is basically this dance between neural networks and evolution and computation could go into the category of automated machine learning to where you're optimizing, whether it's hyperparameters of the topology or hyperparameters taken broadly."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "But the topology thing is really interesting."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "I mean, that's not really done that effectively or throughout the history of machine learning has not been done."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "Usually there's a fixed architecture."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "Maybe there's a few components you're playing with, but to grow a neural network, essentially, the way you grow an organism is really fascinating space."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "How hard is it, do you think, to grow a neural network?"}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And maybe what kind of neural networks are more amenable to this kind of idea than others?"}, {"time": 4144, "text": "I've seen quite a bit of work on recurrent neural networks."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Is there some architectures that are friendlier than others?"}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And is this just a fun, small scale set of experiments or do you have hope that we can be able to grow powerful neural networks?"}, {"time": 4160, "text": "I think we can."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "And most of the work up to now is taking architectures that already exist that humans have designed and try to optimize them further."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And you can totally do that."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "A few years ago, we did an experiment."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "We took a winner of the image captioning competition and the architecture and just broke it into pieces and took the pieces."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "And that was our search base."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "See if you can do better."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "And we indeed could, 15% better performance by just searching around the network design that humans had come up with, Oreo vinyls and others."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "So, but that's starting from a point that humans have produced, but we could do something more general."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "It doesn't have to be that kind of network."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "The hard part is, there are a couple of challenges."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "One of them is to define the search base."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "What are your elements and how you put them together."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And the space is just really, really big."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "So you have to somehow constrain it and have some hunch what will work because otherwise everything is possible."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "And another challenge is that in order to evaluate how good your design is, you have to train it."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "I mean, you have to actually try it out."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "And that's currently very expensive, right?"}, {"time": 4237, "text": "I mean, deep learning networks may take days to train while imagine you having a population of a hundred and have to run it for a hundred generations."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "It's not yet quite feasible computationally."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "It will be, but also there's a large carbon footprint and all that."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "I mean, we are using a lot of computation for doing it."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "So intelligent methods and intelligent, I mean, we have to do some science in order to figure out what the right representations are and right operators are, and how do we evaluate them without having to fully train them."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "And that is where the current research is and we're making progress on all those fronts."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "So yes, there are certain architectures that are more amenable to that approach, but also I think we can create our own architecture and all representations that are even better at that."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "And do you think it's possible to do like a tiny baby network that grows into something that can do state of the art on like even the simple data set like MNIST, and just like it just grows into a gigantic monster that's the world's greatest handwriting recognition system?"}, {"time": 4302, "text": "Yeah, there are approaches like that."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Esteban Real and Cochlear for instance, I worked on evolving a smaller network and then systematically expanding it to a larger one."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "Your elements are already there and scaling it up will just give you more power."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "So again, evolution gives you that starting point and then there's a mechanism that gives you the final result and a very powerful approach."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "But you could also simulate the actual growth process."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "And like I said before, evolving a starting point and then evolving or training the network, there's not that much work that's been done on that yet."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "We need some kind of a simulation environment so the interactions at will, the supervised environment doesn't really, it's not as easily usable here."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "Sorry, the interaction between neural networks?"}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Yeah, the neural networks that you're creating, interacting with the world and learning from these sequences of interactions, perhaps communication with others."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "We would like to get there, but just the task of simulating something is at that level is very hard."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "I love the idea."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "I mean, one of the powerful things about evolution on Earth is the predators and prey emerged."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And like there's just like, there's bigger fish and smaller fish and it's fascinating to think that you could have neural networks competing against each other in one neural network being able to destroy another one."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "There's like wars of neural networks competing to solve the MNIST problem, I don't know."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "Oh, totally, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "And we actually simulated also that prey and it was interesting what happened there, Padmini Rajagopalan did this and Kay Holkamp was a zoologist."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "So we had, again, we had simulated hyenas, simulated zebras."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And initially, the hyenas just tried to hunt them and when they actually stumbled upon the zebra, they ate it and were happy."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "And then the zebras learned to escape and the hyenas learned to team up."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "And actually two of them approached in different directions."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And now the zebras, their next step, they generated a behavior where they split in different directions, just like actually gazelles do when they are being hunted."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "They confuse the predator by going in different directions."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "That emerged and then more hyenas joined and kind of circled them."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "And then when they circled them, they could actually herd the zebras together and eat multiple zebras."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "So there was like an arms race of predators and prey."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "And they gradually developed more complex behaviors, some of which we actually do see in nature."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And this kind of coevolution, that's competitive coevolution, it's a fascinating topic because there's a promise or possibility that you will discover something new that you don't already know."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "You didn't build it in."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "It came from this arms race."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "It's hard to keep the arms race going."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "It's hard to have rich enough simulation that supports all of these complex behaviors."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "But at least for several steps, we've already seen it in this predator prey scenario, yeah."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "First of all, it's fascinating to think about this context in terms of evolving architectures."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "So I've studied Tesla autopilot for a long time."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "It's one particular implementation of an AI system that's operating in the real world."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "I find it fascinating because of the scale at which it's used out in the real world."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "And I'm not sure if you're familiar with that system much, but, you know, Andre Kapathy leads that team on the machine learning side."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And there's a multitask network, multiheaded network, where there's a core, but it's trained on particular tasks."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "And there's a bunch of different heads that are trained on that."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "Is there some lessons from evolutionary computation or neuroevolution that could be applied to this kind of multiheaded beast that's operating in the real world?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Yes, it's a very good problem for neuroevolution."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And the reason is that when you have multiple tasks, they support each other."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So let's say you're learning to classify X ray images to different pathologies."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So you have one task is to classify this disease and another one, this disease, another one, this one."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And when you're learning from one disease, that forces certain kinds of internal representations and embeddings, and they can serve as a helpful starting point for the other tasks."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "So you are combining the wisdom of multiple tasks into these representations."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "And it turns out that you can do better in each of these tasks when you are learning simultaneously other tasks than you would by one task alone."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "Which is a fascinating idea in itself, yeah."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "Yes, and people do that all the time."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "I mean, you use knowledge of domains that you know in new domains, and certainly neural network can do that."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "When neuroevolution comes in is that, what's the best way to combine these tasks?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "Now there's architectural design that allow you to decide where and how the embeddings, the internal representations are combined and how much you combine them."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And there's quite a bit of research on that."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And my team, Elliot Meyerson has worked on that in particular, like what is a good internal representation that supports multiple tasks?"}, {"time": 4637, "text": "And we're getting to understand how that's constructed and what's in it, so that it is in a space that supports multiple different heads, like you said."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And that I think is fundamentally how biological intelligence works as well."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "You don't build a representation just for one task."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "You try to build something that's general, not only so that you can do better in one task or multiple tasks, but also future tasks and future challenges."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "So you learn the structure of the world and that helps you in all kinds of future challenges."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And so you're trying to design a representation that will support an arbitrary set of tasks in a particular sort of class of problem."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Yeah, and also it turns out, and that's again, a surprise that Elliot found was that those tasks don't have to be very related."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "You know, you can learn to do better vision by learning language or better language by learning about DNA structure."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "No, somehow the world."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "Yeah, it rhymes."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "The world rhymes, even if it's very disparate fields."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "I mean, on that small topic, let me ask you, because you've also on the competition neuroscience side, you worked on both language and vision."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "What's the connection between the two?"}, {"time": 4724, "text": "What's more, maybe there's a bunch of ways to ask this, but what's more difficult to build from an engineering perspective and evolutionary perspective, the human language system or the human vision system or the equivalent of in the AI space language and vision, or is it the best as the multitask idea that you're speaking to that they need to be deeply integrated?"}, {"time": 4747, "text": "Yeah, absolutely the latter."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "Learning both at the same time, I think is a fascinating direction in the future."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "So we have data sets where there's visual component as well as verbal descriptions, for instance, and that way you can learn a deeper representation, a more useful representation for both."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "But it's still an interesting question of which one is easier."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "I mean, recognizing objects or even understanding sentences, that's relatively possible, but where it becomes, where the challenges are is to understand the world."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Like the visual world, the 3D, what are the objects doing and predicting what will happen, the relationships."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "That's what makes vision difficult."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And language, obviously it's what is being said, what the meaning is."}, {"time": 4792, "text": "And the meaning doesn't stop at who did what to whom."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "There are goals and plans and themes, and you eventually have to understand the entire human society and history in order to understand the sentence very much fully."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "There are plenty of examples of those kinds of short sentences when you bring in all the world knowledge to understand it."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And that's the big challenge."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Now we are far from that, but even just bringing in the visual world together with the sentence will give you already a lot deeper understanding of what's happening."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And I think that that's where we're going very soon."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "I mean, we've had ImageNet for a long time, and now we have all these text collections, but having both together and then learning a semantic understanding of what is happening, I think that that will be the next step in the next few years."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Yeah, you're starting to see that with all the work with Transformers, was the community, the AI community starting to dip their toe into this idea of having language models that are now doing stuff with images, with vision, and then connecting the two."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "I mean, right now it's like these little explorations we're literally dipping the toe in, but maybe at some point we'll just dive into the pool and it'll just be all seen as the same thing."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "I do still wonder what's more fundamental, whether vision is, whether we don't think about vision correctly."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Maybe the fact, because we're humans and we see things as beautiful and so on, and because we have cameras that are taking pixels as a 2D image, that we don't sufficiently think about vision as language."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Maybe Chomsky is right all along, that vision is fundamental to, sorry, that language is fundamental to everything, to even cognition, to even consciousness."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "The base layer is all language, not necessarily like English, but some weird abstract representation, linguistic representation."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "Yeah, well, earlier we talked about the social structures and that may be what's underlying the language, and that's the more fundamental part, and then language has been added on top of that."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "Language emerges from the social interaction."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "Yeah, that's a very good guess."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "We are visual animals, though."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "A lot of the brain is dedicated to vision, and also, when we think about various abstract concepts, we usually reduce that to vision and images, and that's, you know, we go to a whiteboard, you draw pictures of very abstract concepts."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "So we tend to resort to that quite a bit, and that's a fundamental representation."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "It's probably possible that it predated language even."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "I mean, animals, a lot of, they don't talk, but they certainly do have vision, and language is interesting development in from mastication, from eating."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "You develop an organ that actually can produce sound to manipulate them."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "Maybe that was an accident."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "Maybe that was something that was available and then allowed us to do the communication, or maybe it was gestures."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "Sign language could have been the original proto language."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "We don't quite know, but the language is more fundamental than the medium in which it's communicated, and I think that it comes from those representations."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Now, in current world, they are so strongly integrated, it's really hard to say which one is fundamental."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "You look at the brain structures and even visual cortex, which is supposed to be very much just vision."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "Well, if you are thinking of semantic concepts, you're thinking of language, visual cortex lights up."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "It's still useful, even for language computations."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "So there are common structures underlying them."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "So utilize what you need."}, {"time": 5029, "text": "And when you are understanding a scene, you're understanding relationships."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "Well, that's not so far from understanding relationships between words and concepts."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "So I think that that's how they are integrated."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "Yeah, and there's dreams, and once we close our eyes, there's still a world in there somehow operating and somehow possibly the visual system somehow integrated into all of it."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "I tend to enjoy thinking about aliens and thinking about the sad thing to me about extraterrestrial intelligent life, that if it visited us here on Earth, or if we came on Mars or maybe another solar system, another galaxy one day, that us humans would not be able to detect it or communicate with it or appreciate, like it'd be right in front of our nose and we were too self obsessed to see it."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "Not self obsessed, but our tools, our frameworks of thinking would not detect it."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "As a good movie, Arrival and so on, where Stephen Wolfram and his son, I think were part of developing this alien language of how aliens would communicate with humans."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "Do you ever think about that kind of stuff where if humans and aliens would be able to communicate with each other, like if we met each other at some, okay, we could do SETI, which is communicating from across a very big distance, but also just us, if you did a podcast with an alien, do you think we'd be able to find a common language and a common methodology of communication?"}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I think from a computational perspective, the way to ask that is you have very fundamentally different creatures, agents that are created, would they be able to find a common language?"}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Yes, I do think about that."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "I mean, I think a lot of people who are in computing, they, and AI in particular, they got into it because they were fascinated with science fiction and all of these options."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "I mean, Star Trek generated all kinds of devices that we have now, they envisioned it first and it's a great motivator to think about things like that."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "And I, so one, and again, being a computational scientist and trying to build intelligent agents, what I would like to do is have a simulation where the agents actually evolve communication, not just communication, we've done that, people have done that many times, that they communicate, they signal and so on, but actually develop a language."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "And language means grammar, it means all these social structures and on top of that, grammatical structures."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And we do it under various conditions and actually try to identify what conditions are necessary for it to come out."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "And then we can start asking that kind of questions."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "Are those languages that emerge in those different simulated environments, are they

ashigurami to another over time."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "So that as your opponent's lines of resistance to an initial attack change, you can accommodate those by switching to another form of ashigurami so that your mechanism of control is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs, you can completely change the nature of leg locking and take it away from what it was in the 1990s an opportunistic method of attack based upon surprise, speed and power into one based on control."}, {"time":

people."}, {"time": 6828, "text": "So there is no positional loss."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "You're already underneath them."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "And so that criticism was null and void."},

basic."}, {"time": 8000, "text": "No, the outlines of Hodger's game were basic, but the degree of sophistication and the application was extraordinary, and his ability to refine existing technology

who don't know, Hodger Gracie basically used, just like you said, a very simple techniques on the surface from the outsider's perspective that most people learn when they start jiu jitsu, like passing guard in a very simple way, taking mount and choking from mount."}, {"time": 8049, "text": "Also, when he's on his back, it's closed guard and all the basic submissions from closed guard, arm bar and triangle, and just, that's it."}, {"time": 8060, "text": "And being able to dominate, shut down, and submit."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "So control and submit the best people in the world for many,

story."}, {"time": 8083, "text": "Is there some lessons about his systems that you learn in developing your own systems?"}, {"time": 8092, "text": "Excellent question."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodger was his relentless pursuit of position to submission."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "Everything was done with the belief that no victory was

cases, a lot more skill."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "What I always liked about Hodger is he never tried to play tactics."}, {"time": 8165, "text": "It was always just go out there and try to win by submission."}, {"time": 8171, "text": "And that more than anything, that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory rather than the victory that takes the least skill and the least effort is

position."}, {"time": 8240, "text": "This means that he can play a game between upper body and lower body, which was not really a part of Hodges game."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities."}, {"time": 8252, "text": "He's got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount and a very strong and crushing passing game to the back."}, {"time": 8262,

focuses almost entirely on the classical notion of getting past the legs to the upper body and the other one works between the two as alternatives and sees them as competing alternatives where the stronger you become at one, the more your opponent has to overreact and become vulnerable to the second."}, {"time": 8296, "text": "So they have strong similarities in top position but are very different in bottom."}, {"time": 8302, "text": "He has, from an outsider's perspective, a calm to him in the heat of battle that's inspiring and confusing."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "Is there

can look at soccer, Robocup, and then you can look at grappling."}, {"time": 9082, "text": "There's something about when you start to think, how would I build an AI system, a robot that defeats

"So essentially, your question is, can a talented group of engineers create a robot which could defeat Gordon Ryan?"}, {"time": 9138, "text": "On the face of it, as you just pointed out, that's the easiest project in the world, just create a robot that carries a nine millimeter automatic and shoot them five times in the chest."}, {"time": 9148, "text": "Okay, that's it, Gordon Ryan's done."},

physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan, not inferior and not superior, what would it take to create a mind inside that robot that would beat Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?"}, {"time": 9173, "text": "Yeah, and there's two ways to build AI systems."}, {"time": 9176, "text": "This is true for autonomous driving, for example, which has been quite contested recently."}, {"time": 9183, "text": "So one is you basically, one way to describe it is you have a giant set of rules."}, {"time": 9189, "text": "It's like this tree of rules where you apply in different condition when there's a pattern you see, you apply a rule and they're hard coded in."}, {"time": 9197, "text": "You basically get like a John Donr type of character who tries to encode, hard code into the system, all the moves you should do in every single case."}, {"time": 9209, "text": "Of course, you can't actually do that fully."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "So you're going to be taking shortcuts, what are called heuristics, just a basic kind of generalizations and apply your own expertise as an expert of, in this case, grappling, to see how that can be coded as a rule."}, {"time": 9229, "text": "Now, the other approach, Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach, which is called machine learning, which is create a basic framework of the kind of things you should be observing and what are the measures, metrics of success, and then just observe and see which things lead to success, more success and which lead to less success."}, {"time": 9256, "text": "And there's a delta."}, {"time": 9257,

it actually turns out and if it's worse or better, you adjust your expectations."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "And through that process, you can learn quite a lot."}, {"time": 9279, "text": "The challenge is, and this might be a very true challenge in grappling, is like in driving, you can't crash."}, {"time": 9292, "text": "So there's a physical world."}, {"time": 9295, "text": "In chess, for example, where this approach has been exceptionally successful, you can work in simulation."}, {"time": 9302, "text": "So you can have AI system that, for example, as in the case with AlphaZero by

measured in the billions."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "Like, the number of atoms, that's just a number so mind blowing it's impossible, okay?"}, {"time": 9552, "text": "So no computer is ever going to be able to work with those kinds of numbers, okay?"}, {"time": 9559, "text": "I didn't even know future generations of quantum computers could work with those kinds of numbers."}, {"time": 9564,

available options and make decisions in a given timeframe."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "So that's the fundamental problem."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "So as Lex correctly pointed out, the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "These are rules of thumb, which give general guidelines to action."}, {"time": 9591, "text": "So for example, in jiu jitsu, I could give you a general rule of thumb."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "Don't turn your back on your opponent, okay?"}, {"time": 9597, "text": "That's a solid piece of advice."}, {"time": 9599, "text": "There are obviously some exceptions to that rule, but it's a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner."}, {"time": 9604, "text": "The moment you give that heuristic rule, you rule out a lot of options, okay?"}, {"time": 9609, "text": "You've already told someone don't turn your back, don't turn your back on someone."}, {"time": 9612, "text": "So a lot of possibilities have just been turned away right there."}, {"time": 9616, "text": "So you've cut the number of options in half right there just by giving one heuristic rule, okay?"}, {"time": 9622, "text": "If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent, and you knew enough to give say 10 heuristic rules, you could chop that initially vast number of options down by a vast amount."}, {"time": 9636, "text": "And now you're starting to get to a point where if a computer had sufficient computational power, it could start getting through the number of options in that acceptable timeframe."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "So that's the

the matches."}, {"time": 9698, "text": "But they did, Deep Blue unequivocally won the confrontation."}, {"time": 9703, "text": "And it was seen as like this watershed moment where a computer beat the

moments in computing history, is really when the first time a machine beat a human at a thing that humans really care about in the domain of intellectual pursuits."}, {"time": 9726, "text": "Yeah, it was a powerful, powerful moment."}, {"time": 9730, "text": "Now, not only was that a powerful moment, but things started getting truly interesting from that moment forward, because then you started having different areas of development."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "The general way in which the progress is made from those early starts in 1968, all the way through to Deep Blue's victory, was of the use of heuristic rules that brought down the number of potential options to a manageable level."}, {"time": 9764, "text": "As computer power increased, then it could make faster and faster and wiser and wiser decisions, and make them at a rate which no human, even the best human, could keep up with."}, {"time": 9774, "text": "So that was the general way in which the debate went."}, {"time": 9778,

out a program, AlphaZero, which can look at the basic rule structures of chess, and then ultimately play itself in trials, and make trial and error assessment of what are good and bad strategies, so that with no human intervention, a computer could start doing remarkable things."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "Not only did this company create AlphaZero, and there were some other ones too, they fought not only in chess, but in the much more complex Asian game of Go, which has far more potential options than chess does, by a very significant margin."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "These machine learning programs, not only easily defeat any human in chess, but in Go as well."}, {"time": 9848, "text": "And what's truly remarkable is they weren't just beating them."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "When

second most powerful chess program in the world."}, {"time": 9874, "text": "That's literally like taking a human, telling the rules of chess, they play some games with themselves for four hours, and they go out and beat Garry Kasparov."}, {"time": 9884, "text": "This is, I don't know, this is, to me, this is a truly exciting development, far beyond even what Deep Blue did."}, {"time": 9895,

topic."}, {"time": 9986, "text": "So to wind things up here, we've got this fascinating initial question from Lex, the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot which doesn't have any special physical properties?"}, {"time": 10002, "text": "This is mind versus mind because the bodies negate each other."}, {"time": 10006, "text": "The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan."}, {"time":

talking now at a level where the machine learning of defeating world champions in chess and Go in four hours, like just from starting from the rules of the sport, this is gonna be difficult for humans to keep up with."}, {"time": 10067, "text": "Now in humans favor, could we take Gordon Ryan and put a chip inside his brain that created the same cyborg effect as we saw in centaur chess and cyborg chess, and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level and suddenly his computational powers were massively increased."}, {"time": 10085, "text": "He still has his heuristic insight, but he has vastly augmented computational powers."}, {"time": 10091, "text": "That's the interesting battle."}, {"time": 10095, "text": "You asked a great question, Lex."}, {"time": 10096, "text": "Let me give you my initial push for an answer would be that if it's just Gordon Ryan versus your robot technology, in 10 years, I would say with machine learning, I'd say you guys win every time."}, {"time": 10111,

being able to communicate between a computer and the brain."}, {"time": 10153, "text": "So you preserve most of what there is in the human body, including the nervous system and the computing system we currently have that's biological and expanding over the computer."}, {"time": 10166, "text": "There's also on the cyborg chess front, like Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion in chess, he studies AlphaZero games."}, {"time": 10178, "text": "Like it's not a regular thing for high level grandmasters."}, {"time": 10182, "text": "From what I understand, almost every chess master now studies computer games for inspiration."}, {"time": 10188, "text": "Like just as great chess players from the past used to go back into old leather bound books of previous grandmasters and study games and books."}, {"time": 10200, "text": "Nowadays, most people, when they wanna study the most perfect games, they actually study programs like AlphaZero."}, {"time": 10206, "text": "Yeah, and it's not just for inspiration, it's education."}, {"time": 10209, "text": "I mean, it's literally part of their training regimen."}, {"time": 10212, "text": "This isn't like a fun side thing."}, {"time": 10214, "text": "This is the main way to get better."}, {"time": 10218, "text": "So there's a certain element there where even our human brains can be trained by observing the partial explorations of

those folks are currently not that interested in the grappling world."}, {"time": 10288, "text": "So they kind of stop there."}, {"time": 10290, "text": "But it's very possible in simulation to then develop ideas."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "In fact, this is something that I should probably do, but it's pretty natural to do it easy, is ideas of control and submission and all the, you add the ability to, I don't know how to put it nicely, but to choke your opponent and to break their body parts off, which is what jiu jitsu is."}, {"time": 10320, "text": "Add that in and what kind of ideas it'll come up with is very fascinating."}, {"time": 10325, "text": "I actually don't know, until this conversation, I don't know why I never even thought about that."}, {"time": 10328, "text": "I've been very obsessed with just like walking and running and all those kinds of things, like evolving different strategies for when you have a bunch of, so one difficult thing for robots is when you have uneven terrain and there's uncertainty about the terrain is how to keep walking."}, {"time": 10345, "text": "Or when there's a bunch of things being thrown at you, all that kind of stuff, and you learn through self play how to be able to navigate those uncertain environments when there's a lot of weird objects and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 10358, "text": "There's no reason why you can't just do that with submissions and so on in simulation."}, {"time": 10363, "text": "That'll be actually fascinating."}, {"time": 10364, "text": "But once we might be surprised by the kind of strategies in simulation these AI systems will develop, and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan and much better John Donahar in asking the Dean Lister question of like, why are we only using, why are we not doing X?"}, {"time": 10386, "text": "But on the actual sort of grappling event in the physical space, I've been very surprised and a little bit disappointed by how difficult it's to

difficult to build a system that's able to experience the world and act onto the world as richly as we humans can."}, {"time": 10470, "text": "Yeah, if picking up a cup is a seemingly insurmountable challenge, then taking someone down, controlling them, getting past their legs, that's going to be one hell of a project."}, {"time": 10482, "text": "Exactly, I mean, there could be shortcuts, but I

weird."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "Like how precisely it was able to sort of remove the distractions of the world and really help my mind."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "Obviously, like the mind is trying

should definitely try it if you're listening to this."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Maybe it's just my own mind, but it's funny, like it made me, brown noise made me realize that there's probably hacks

still carrying the burdens of that decision."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "But yeah, sleep is one of those things that's making me wonder about the variability between humans a little bit and how science

doing stuff I love."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "You should get more love in your life, bro."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "So, but that said, in aggregate, when you look at the full span of life, is probably you should be getting a consistent amount of sleep."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "And it seems like it's in that seven, eight hour range."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "Yeah, but it's similar to food."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "It's the quality, not the quantity, right?"}, {"time": 4449, "text": "And when you get it."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So I look at my data pretty often."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "And what makes a difference to me is not the amount of hours, but the quality, the depth and the deep sleep is what will do it."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "So if I have a lot of alcohol

as a society decide is acceptable in the realms of academia, government or private industry?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And if we decide as a society that it's perfectly okay for people with varying research agendas to create pathogens that if released could wipe out humanity, if we think that's fine and if that kind of work starts happening in one lab, five labs, 50 labs, 500 labs in one country, then 10 countries, then 70 countries or whatever, that risk of a boo boo starts rising astronomically."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And this won't be a spoiler alert based on the way that I presented those two things, but I think it's unbelievably important to manage both of those risks."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "The easier one to manage, although it wouldn't be simple by any stretch

perspective we need to have."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "We'd have to collectively agree that there's no line of research that justifies that."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "The reason why I believe that would be a highly rational conclusion is even the highest level of biosafety lab in the world, biosafety lab level four."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "And there are not a lot of BSL four labs in the world."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "There are things can and have leaked out of BSL four labs and some of the work that's been done with potentially annihilating pathogens, which we can talk about, it's

impervious to leaks."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "So why in the world would we create something where if God forbid it leaked, could annihilate us all."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And by the way, almost all of the measures that are taken in biosafety level anything labs are designed to prevent accidental leaks."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "What happens if you have a malevolent insider?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "We could talk about the psychology and the motivations of what would make a malevolent insider who wants to release something and not annihilating in a bit."}, {"time": 1507, "text":

and four are about preventing somebody hijacking the process."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Some of them are, but they're mainly designed against accidents."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "They're imperfect against accidents."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "And if this kind of work starts happening in lots and lots of labs with every lab you add, the odds of there being a malevolent inside are naturally increased arithmetically as the number of labs goes up."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And I think we do both of those things, decide that no, we're not going to experimentally make annihilating pathogens in leaky labs, and B, yes, we are going to take countermeasures that are going to cost a fraction of our annual defense budget to preclude their creation, then I think both risks get managed down."},

1601, "text": "So can we talk about this kind of research and what's actually done and what are the positives and negatives of it?"}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So if we look at gain of function research and the kind of stuff that's happening in level three and level four BSL labs, what's the whole idea here?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Is it trying to engineer viruses to understand how they behave?"}, {"time": 1621, "text": "You want to understand the dangerous ones."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So that would be the logic behind doing it."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And so gain of function can mean a lot of different things."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Viewed through a certain lens, gain of function research could be what you do when you create, you know, GMOs, when you create, you know, hearty strains of corn that are resistant to pesticides."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "I mean, you could view that as gain of function."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So I'm going to refer to gain of function in a relatively narrow sense, which is actually the sense that the term is usually used, which is in some way magnifying capabilities of microorganisms to make them more dangerous, whether it's more transmissible or more deadly."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "And in that line of research, I'll use an example from 2011 because it's very illustrative and it's also very chilling."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "Back in 2011, two separate labs independently of one another, I assume there was some kind of communication between them, but they were basically independent projects, one in Holland and one in Wisconsin, did gain of function research on something called H5N1 flu."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "H5N1 is, you know, something that, at least on a lethality basis, makes COVID look like a kitten."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "You know, COVID, according to the World Health Organization, has a case fatality rate somewhere between half a percent and one percent, H5N1 is closer to 60 percent, six zero."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And so that's actually even slightly more lethal than Ebola."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "It's a very, very, very scary pathogen."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "The good news about H5N1 is that it is barely, barely contagious."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "But I believe it is in no way contagious human to human."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "It requires, you know, very, very, very deep contact with birds, in most cases chickens."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And so if you're a chicken farmer and you spend an enormous amount of time around them and perhaps you get into situations in which you get a break in your skin and you're interacting intensely with fowl who, as it turns out, have H5N1, that's when the jump comes."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "But it's not, there's no airborne transmission that we're aware of human to human."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "I mean, not that it just doesn't exist."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "I think the World Health Organization did a relentless survey of the number of H5N1 cases."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "I think they do it every year."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "I saw one 10 year series where I think it was like 500 fatalities over the course of a decade."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And that's a drop in the bucket."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "Kind of fun, fun fact, I believe the typical lethality from lightning over 10 years is 70,000 deaths."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So we think getting struck by lightning, pretty low risk, H5N1 much, much lower than that."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "What happened in these experiments is the experimenters in both cases set out to make H5N1 that would be contagious, that could create airborne transmission."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "And so they basically passed it, I think in both cases, they passed it through a large number of ferrets."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "And so this wasn't like CRISPR, there wasn't even any CRISPR back in those days."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "This was relatively straightforward, selecting for a particular outcome."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And after guiding the path and passing them through, again, I believe it was a series of ferrets."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "They did in fact come up with a version of H5N1 that is capable of airborne transmission."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Now they didn't unleash it into the world."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "They didn't inject it into humans to see what would happen."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "And so for those two reasons, we don't really know how contagious it might have been."},

the people who did it were good guys."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "They were virologists."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "I believe their agenda as they explained it was much as you said, let's figure out what a worst case scenario might look like so we can understand it better."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "But my understanding is in both cases, it was done in BSL3 labs."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And so potential of leak, significantly nonzero, hopefully way below 1% but significantly nonzero."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And when you look at the consequences of an escape in terms of human lives, destruction of a large portion of the economy, et cetera, and you do an expected value calculation on whatever fraction of 1% that was, you would come up with a staggering cost, staggering expected cost for this work."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "So it should never have been carried out."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "Now you might make an argument if you said, if you believed that H5N1 in nature is on an inevitable path to airborne transmission, and it's only going to be a small number of years, A."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "And B, if it makes that transition, there is one set of changes to its metabolic pathways and its genomic code and so forth, one that we have discovered."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So it is going to go from point A, which is where it is right now, to point B."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "We have reliably engineered point B."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "That is the destination."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And we need to start fighting that right now because this is five years or less away."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Now that'd be a very different world."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "That'd be like spotting an asteroid that's coming toward the earth and is five years off."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "And yes, you marshal everything you can to resist that."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "But there's two problems with that perspective."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "The first is, in however many thousands of generations that humans have been inhabiting this planet, there has never been a transmissible form of H5N1."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "And influenza has been around for a very long time."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So there is no case for inevitability of this kind of a jump to airborne transmission."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So we're not on a freight train to that outcome."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "And if there was inevitability around that, it's not like there's just one set of genetic code that would get there."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "There's all kinds of different mutations that could conceivably result in that kind of an outcome, unbelievable diversity of mutations."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And so we're not actually creating something we're inevitably going to face, but we are creating something, we are creating a very powerful and unbelievably negative card and injecting it in the deck that nature never put into the deck."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "So in that case, I just don't see any moral or scientific justification for that kind of work."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And interestingly, there was quite a bit of excitement and concern about this when the work came out."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "One of the teams was going to publish their results in Science, the other in Nature."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And there were a lot of editorials and a lot of scientists are saying, this is crazy."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "And publication of those papers did get suspended."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "And not long after that, there was a pause put on US government funding, NIH funding on gain of function research."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "But both of those speed bumps were ultimately removed."}, {"time": 2021, "text":

understanding is resumed their funding, got their government funding back."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "I don't know why a Dutch project is getting NIH funding, but whatever, about a year and a half ago."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So as far as the US government and regulators are concerned, it's all systems go for gain of function at this point, which I find very troubling."}, {"time": 2047,

my colleagues, my colleagues, friends, as far as I can tell, people in the AI community are not really talking about autonomous weapon systems as now US and China full steam ahead on the development of both."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "And that seems to be a similar kind of thing on gain of function."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "I've, you know, have friends in the biology space and they don't want to talk about gain of function publicly."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And I don't, that makes me very uncomfortable from an outsider perspective in terms of gain of function."}, {"time": 2091, "text":

relatively narrow context of over assessing because you could say almost, you know, anything that you do to make biology more effective as gain of function."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "So within the narrow confines of what we're discussing, I think it would be easy enough for level headed people in all of the countries, level headed governmental people in all the countries that realistically could support such a program to agree, we don't want this to happen because all labs leak."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "I mean, and you know, an example that I use, I actually didn't use it in the piece

bit further off, but it wouldn't cost tens of billions in research dollars, it would be a relatively modest and affordable budget in relation to the threat at home diagnostics that can really, really

tier system where clinicians in the field could very rapidly determine do you have one of the infections of acute interest here, either because it's very common in this region, so we want to diagnose as many things as we can at the front line, or because it's uncommon but unbelievably threatening like Ebola."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "So front line worker can make that determination very, very

powerful early warning system."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "There's a guy named Bill Lampos at University College London who basically did a very rigorous analysis that showed that symptom searches

"16 days of forewarning can be monumentally important in the early days of an outbreak."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "And this is a very, very talented, but nonetheless very resource constrained academic

requires is it requires trust in institutions to carry out these kinds of programs and requires trust in science and engineers and sort of centralized organizations that would operate at scale here."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "And much of that trust has been, at least in the United States, diminished."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Like they're trying to, in a self preserving way, control the

scientists make, that institutions make."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "The leak from the lab is a perfect example where we have imperfect systems that make all the progress we see in the world."},

disappointing because I do think just like you mentioned, the solutions require people to trust the institutions with their data."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And I think part of the problem is it seems to me as an outsider that there was a bizarre unwillingness on the part of the CDC and other institutions to admit to, to frame and to contextualize uncertainty."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "Maybe they had a patronizing idea that these people need to be told and when they're told, they need to be told with authority and a level of definitiveness and certain certitude that doesn't actually exist."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And so when they whipsaw on recommendations like what you should do about masks, when the CDC is kind of at the very beginning of the pandemic saying, masks don't do anything."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Don't wear them."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "When the real driver for that was we don't want these clowns going out and depleting Amazon of masks because they may be needed in medical settings and we just don't know yet."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "I think a message that actually respected people and said, this is why we're asking you not to do masks yet and there's more to be seen would be less whipsawing and would bring people like they feel more like they're part of the conversation and they're being treated like adults than saying one day definitively masks suck."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "And then X days later saying, nope, they haven't wear masks."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And so I think framing things in terms of the probabilities, which most people are easy to parse."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "I mean, a more recent example, which I just thought was batty was suspending the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for a very low single digit number of days in the United States based on the fact that I believe there had been seven ish clotting incidents in roughly seven million people who had had the vaccine administered, I believe one of which resulted in a fatality."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And there was definitely suggestive data that indicated that there was a relationship."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "This wasn't just coincidental because I think all of the clotting incidents happened in women as opposed to men and kind of clustered in a certain age group."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "But does that call for shutting off the vaccine or does it call for leveling with the American public and saying we've had one fatality out of seven million?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "This is, let's just assume substantially less than the likelihood of getting struck by lightning."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "Based on that information, and we're going to keep you posted because you can trust us to keep you posted, based on that information, please decide whether you're comfortable with a Johnson and Johnson vaccine."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "That would have been one response and I think people would have been able to parse the simple bits of data and make their own judgment."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "By turning it off, all of a sudden there's this dramatic signal to people who don't read all 900 words in the New York

off."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And then all the people who sat on the fence or are sitting on the fence about whether or not they trust vaccines, that is going to push an incalculable number of people."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "That's going to be the last straw for we don't know how many hundreds of thousands or more likely millions of people to say, okay, tipping point here, I don't trust these vaccines."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "By pausing that for whatever it was, 10 or 12 days, and then flipping the switch as everybody who knew much about the situation knew was inevitable."},

fear and hope in this world."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "I tend to believe that in terms of competence and malevolence, that people who are, maybe it's in my interactions, I tend to see that, first of all, I believe that most people are good and want to do good and are just better at doing good and more inclined to do good on this world, and more than that, people who are malevolent are usually incompetent at building technology."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So I've seen this in my life, that people who are exceptionally good at stuff, no matter what the stuff is, tend to, maybe they discover

meditation."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "For me, like there's a bunch of mechanisms which take my mind into a very particular place that looks a whole lot like meditation."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "For example, when I've been running over the past couple years, and especially when I listen to certain kinds of audio books, like I've listened to the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "I've listened to a lot of sort of World War II, which at once, because I have a lot of family who's lost in World War II and so much of the Soviet Union is grounded in the suffering of World

6223, "text": "And so you're also running, like it clears the mind from all the concerns of the world and somehow it takes you to this place where you were like deeply appreciative to be alive in the sense that as opposed to listening to your breath or like feeling your breath and thinking about your consciousness and all those kinds of processes that Sam's app does."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "Well, this does that for me, the running and flossing may do that for you."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "So maybe Herman Hesse is onto something."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "So I hope flossing is not my

editing."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "I definitely enter a flow state when I'm mixing and mastering music."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "I enter a flow state when I'm doing heavy, heavy research to either

YouTube lecture and going through this presentation and so forth."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "So maybe because there's a lot of things that bring me into a flow state in my normal weekly life, not

do with like the frequencies."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "Like the white noise is usually less bassy, brown noise is very bassy."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "So it's more like versus like, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "So there's like a deepness to it."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "I think everyone is different, but for me, when I was a research scientist at MIT, especially when there's a lot of students around, I remember just being annoyed at the noise of people talking."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And one of my colleagues said, well, you should try listening to brown noise."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "Like it really knocks out everything."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "Because I used to wear earplugs to it, like just see if I can block it out."}, {"time": 6400, "text":

that, it just goes, the mind just focuses in, it's kind of incredible."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "So I see that as a kind of meditation, maybe I'm using a performance enhancing sound to achieve that meditation, but I've been doing that for many years now and running and walking and doing, Cal Newport was the first person that introduced me to the idea of deep work."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "Just put a word to the kind of thinking that's required to sort of deeply think about a problem, especially if it's mathematical in nature."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "I see that as a kind of meditation

you from all over the place."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "And the whole process is you slowly let them kind of move past you."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "And that's a meditative process."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "It's very meditative."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "That sounds a lot like what Sam talks about in his meditation app, which I did use to be clear for a while, of just letting the thought

interesting point is, and the same with the fasting and the diet, is I long ago stopped trusting experts or maybe taking the word of experts as the gospel truth and only using it as an inspiration to try something, to try thoroughly something."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "So fasting was one of the things when I first discovered I've been many times eating just once a day, so that's a 24 hour fast."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "It makes me feel amazing."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "And at the same time, eating only meat, putting ethical concerns aside, makes me feel amazing."}, {"time": 6572,

what was it?"}, {"time": 6617, "text": "Well, the noticeable impact is day one."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "So for me, folks, cause I eat a very low carb diet."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "So the hunger wasn't the hugest issue."}, {"time": 6625, "text": "Like there wasn't a painful hunger, like wanting to eat."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "So I was already kind of primed for it."}, {"time": 6631,

music industry was, look, what you need to do to fight piracy, you can't put the genie back in the bottle."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "You can't switch off the internet."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "Even if you all shut your eyes and wish very, very, very hard, the internet is not going away."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "And these peer to peer technologies are genies out of the bottle."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "And if you don't, whatever you do, don't shut down Napster because if you do, suddenly that technology is going to splinter into 30 different nodes that you'll never, ever be able to shut off."}, {"time": 7492, "text": "We suggested to them is like, look, what you want to do is to create a massively better experience to piracy, something that's way better, that you sell at a completely reasonable price."}, {"time": 7504, "text": "And this is what it is."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "Don't just give people access to that very limited number of songs that they happen to have acquired and paid for or pirated and have on their hard drive."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Give them access to all of the music in the world for a simple low price."}, {"time": 7519, "text": "And obviously, that doesn't sound like a crazy suggestion, I don't think, to anybody's ears today because that is how the majority of music is now being consumed online."}, {"time": 7526, "text": "But in doing that, you're going to create a much, much better option to this kind of crappy, kind of rickety, kind of buggy process of acquiring MP3s."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "Now, unfortunately, the music industry was so angry about Napster and so forth that for essentially three and a half years, they folded their arms, stamped their feet, and boycotted the internet."}, {"time": 7549, "text": "So they basically gave people who were fervently passionate about music and were digitally modern, they gave them basically one choice."}, {"time": 7557, "text": "If you want to have access to digital music, we, the music industry, insist that you steal it because we are not going to sell it to you."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "So what that did is it made an entire generation of people morally comfortable with swiping the music because they felt quite pragmatically, well, they're not giving me any choice here."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "It's like a 20 year old violating the 21 drinking age."}, {"time": 7578, "text": "If they do that, they're not going to feel like felons."}, {"time": 7581, "text": "They're going to be like, this is an unreasonable law and I'm skirting it, right?"}, {"time": 7585, "text": "So they make a whole generation of people morally comfortable with swiping music, but also technically adept at it."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "And when they did shut down Napster and kind of even trickier tools and like tweakier tools like Kazaa and so forth came along, people just figured out how to do it."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "So by the time they finally, grudgingly, it took years, allowed us to release this experience that we were quite convinced would be better than piracy, we had this enormous hole had been dug where lots of people said, music is a thing that is free and that's morally okay and I know how to get it."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "And so streaming took many, many, many more years to take off and become the gargantuan thing the juggernaut is today than would have happened if they'd made, pivoted to let's sell a better experience as opposed to demand that people want digital music, steal it."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "Like what lessons do we draw from that?"}, {"time": 7641, "text": "Cause we're probably in the midst of living through a bunch of similar situations in different domains currently."}, {"time": 7647, "text": "We just don't know."}, {"time": 7648, "text": "There's a lot of things in this world that are really painful."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "Like, I mean, I don't know if you can draw perfect parallels, but fiat money versus cryptocurrency, there's a lot of currently people in power who are kind of very skeptical about cryptocurrency, although that's changing."}, {"time": 7663, "text": "But it's arguable it's changing way too slowly."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "There's a lot of people making that argument where there should be a complete like Coinbase and all this stuff switched to that."}, {"time": 7672, "text": "There's a lot of other domains that where a pivot, like if you pivot now, you're going to win big, but you don't pivot because you're stubborn."}, {"time": 7685, "text": "And it's so, I mean, like, is this just the way that companies are?"}, {"time": 7689, "text": "A company succeeds initially and then it grows and there's a huge number of employees and managers that don't have the guts or the institutional mechanisms to do the pivot."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "Is that just the way of companies?"}, {"time": 7703, "text": "Well, I think what happens, I'll use the case of the music industry."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "There was an economic model that had put food on the table and paid for marble lobbies and seven and even eight figure executive salaries for many, many decades, which was the physical collection of music."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "And then you start talking about something like unlimited streaming and it seems so ephemeral and like such a long shot that people start worrying about cannibalizing their own business and they lose sight of the fact that something illicit is cannibalizing their business at an extraordinarily fast rate."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "And so if they don't do it themselves, they're doomed."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "I mean, we used to put slides in front of these folks, this is really funny, where we said, okay, let's assume Rhapsody, we want it to be 9.99 a month and we want it to be 12 months, so it's $120 a year from the budget of a music lover."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And then we were also able to get reasonably accurate statistics that showed how many CDs per year the average person who bothered to collect music, which was not all people, actually bought."}, {"time": 7764, "text": "And it was overwhelmingly clear that the average CD buyer spends a hell of a lot less than $120 a year on music."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "This is a revenue expansion, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "But all they could think of, and I'm not saying this in a pejorative or patronizing way, I don't blame them, they've grown up in this environment for decades, all they could think of was the incredible margins that they had on a CD."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "And they would say, well, if this CD, by the mechanism that you guys are proposing, the CD that I'm selling for $17.99, somebody would need to stream those songs."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "We were talking about a penny of playback then, it's less than that now that the record labels get paid."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "But would have to stream songs from that 1,799 times, it's never gonna happen."}, {"time": 7810, "text": "So they were just sort of stuck in the model of this, but it's like, no, dude, but they're gonna spend money on all this other stuff."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "So I think people get very hung up on that."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "I mean, another example is really the taxi industry was not monolithic, like the music labels."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "There was a whole bunch of fleets and a whole bunch of cities, very, very fragmented, it's an imperfect analogy."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "But nonetheless, imagine if the taxi industry writ large upon seeing Uber said, oh my God, people wanna be able to hail things easily, cheaply, they don't wanna mess with cash, they wanna know how many minutes it's gonna be, they wanna know the fare in advance, and they want a much bigger fleet than what we've got."}, {"time": 7846, "text": "If the taxi industry had rolled out something like that with the branding of yellow taxis, universally known and kind of loved by Americans and expanded their fleet in a necessary manner, I don't think Uber or Lyft ever would have gotten a foothold."}, {"time": 7861, "text": "But the problem there was that real economics in the taxi industry wasn't with fares, it was with the scarcity of medallions."}, {"time": 7870, "text": "And so the taxi fleets, in many cases, owned gazillions of medallions whose value came from their very scarcity."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "So they simply couldn't pivot to that."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "So I think you end up having these vested interests with economics that aren't necessarily visible to outsiders who get very, very reluctant to disrupt their own model, which is why it ends up coming from the outside so frequently."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "So you know what it takes to build a successful startup, but you're also an investor in a lot of successful startups."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Let me ask for advice."}, {"time": 7903, "text": "What do you think it takes to build a successful startup by way of advice?"}, {"time": 7908, "text": "JS Well, I think it starts, I mean, everything starts and even ends with the founder."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "And so I think it's really, really important to look at the founder's motivations and their sophistication about what they're doing."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "In almost all cases that I'm familiar with and have thought hard about, you've had a founder who was deeply, deeply inculcated in the domain of technology that they were taking on."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "Now, what's interesting about that is you could say, no, wait, how is that possible because there's so many young founders?"}, {"time": 7941, "text": "When you look at young founders, they're generally coming out of very nascent emerging fields of technology where simply being present and accounted for and engaged in the community for a period of even months is enough time to make them very, very deeply inculcated."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "I mean, you look at Marc Andreessen and Netscape."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "Marc had been doing visual web browsers when Netscape had been founded for what, a year and a half, but he'd created the first one in Mosaic when he was an undergrad."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "And the commercial internet was pre nascent in 1994 when Netscape was founded."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "So there's somebody who's very, very deep in their domain."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "Mark Zuckerberg also, social networking, very deep in his domain, even though it was nascent at the time."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "Lots of people doing crypto stuff."}, {"time": 7987, "text": "I mean, 10 years ago, even seven or eight years ago, by being a really, really vehement and engaged participant in the crypto ecosystem, you could be an expert in that."}, {"time": 7999, "text": "You look, however, at more established industries, take Salesforce.com."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "Salesforce automation, pretty mature field when it got started."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "Who's the executive and the founder?"}, {"time": 8008, "text": "Marc Benioff, who has spent 13 years at Oracle and was an investor in Siebel Systems, which ended up being Salesforce's main competition."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "So more established, you need the entrepreneur to be very, very deep in the technology and the culture of the space because you need that entrepreneur, that founder to have just an unbelievably accurate intuitive sense for where the puck is going."}, {"time": 8036, "text": "And that only comes from being very deep."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "So that is sort of factor number one."}, {"time": 8041, "text": "And the next thing is that that founder needs to be charismatic and or credible, or ideally both in exactly the right ways to be able to attract a team that is bought into that vision and is bought into that founder's intuitions being correct and not just the team, obviously, but also the investors."}, {"time": 8061, "text": "So it takes a certain personality type to pull that off."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "Then the next thing I'm still talking about the founder is a relentlessness and indeed a monomania to put this above things that might rationally, should perhaps rationally supersede it for a period of time to just relentlessly pivot when pivoting is called for and it's always called for."}, {"time": 8088, "text": "I mean, think of even very successful companies like how many times did Facebook pivot?"}, {"time": 8093, "text": "Newsfeed was something that was completely alien to the original version of Facebook and came foundationally important."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "How many times did Google, how many times at any given, how many times has Apple pivoted?"}, {"time": 8104, "text": "That founder energy and DNA when the founder moves on the DNA that's been inculcated with a company has to have that relentlessness and that ability to pivot and pivot and pivot without being worried about sacred cows."}, {"time": 8118, "text": "And then the last thing I'll say about the founder before I get to the rest of the team and that'll be mercifully brief is the founder has to be obviously a really great hirer but just important a very good firer."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "And firing is a horrific experience for both people involved in it."}, {"time": 8137, "text": "It is a wrenching emotional experience."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "And being good at realizing when this particular person is damaging the interests of the company and the team and the shareholders and having the intestinal fortitude to have that conversation and make it happen is something that most people don't have in them."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "And it's something that needs to be developed in most people or maybe some people have it naturally."}, {"time": 8168, "text": "But without that ability, that will take an A plus organization into B minus range very, very quickly."}, {"time": 8175, "text": "And so that's all what needs to be present in the founder."}, {"time": 8179, "text": "Can I just say?"}, {"time": 8181, "text": "How damn good you are, Rob."}, {"time": 8182, "text": "That was brilliant."}, {"time": 8184, "text": "The one thing that was kind of really kind of surprising to me is having a deep technical knowledge because I think the way you expressed it, which is that allows you to be really honest with the capabilities of what like what's possible."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "Of course, you're often trying to do the impossible."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "But in order to do the impossible, you have to be quote unquote impossible."}, {"time": 8211, "text": "But you have to be honest with what is actually possible."}, {"time": 8214, "text": "And it doesn't necessarily have to be the technical competence."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "It's got to be, in my view, just a complete immersion in that emerging market."}, {"time": 8222, "text": "And so I can imagine there are a couple of people out there who have started really good crypto projects who themselves are right in the code, but they're immersed in the culture and through the culture and a deep understanding of what's happening and what's not happening."}, {"time": 8236, "text": "They can get a good intuition of what's possible, but the very first hire, I mean, a great way to solve that is to have a technical co founder and dual founder companies have become extremely common for that reason."}, {"time": 8250, "text": "And if you're not doing that and you're not the technical person, but you are the founder, you've got to be really great at hiring a very damn good technical person very, very fast."}, {"time": 8263, "text": "Can I on the founder ask you, is it possible to do this alone?"}, {"time": 8270, "text": "There's so many people giving advice and saying that it's impossible to do the first few steps, not impossible, but much more difficult to do it alone."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "If we were to take the journey, especially in the software world where there's not significant investment required for it to build something up, is it possible to go to a prototype to something that essentially works and already has a huge number of customers alone?"}, {"time": 8295, "text": "There are lots and lots of loan founder companies out there that have made an incredible difference."}, {"time": 8301, "text": "I mean, I'm not certainly putting rhapsody in the league of Spotify."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "We were too early to be Spotify, but we did an awful lot of innovation."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "And then after the company sold and ended up in the hands of real networks and MTV, you know, got to millions of subs, right?"}, {"time": 8315, "text": "I was a loan founder and I studied Arabic and Middle Eastern history undergrad, so I definitely wasn't very, very technical."}, {"time": 8322, "text": "But yeah, loan founders can absolutely work."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "And the advantage of a loan founder is you don't have the catastrophic potential of a falling out between founders."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "I mean, two founders who fall out with each other badly can rip a company to shreds because they both have an enormous amount of equity and enormous amount of power."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "And the capital structure is a result of that."}, {"time": 8346, "text": "They both have an enormous amount of moral authority with the team as a result of each having that founder role."}, {"time": 8354, "text": "And I have witnessed over the years many, many situations in which companies have been shredded or have suffered near fatal blows because of a falling out between founders."}, {"time": 8367, "text": "And the more founders you add, the more risky that becomes."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "I don't think there should ever almost, I mean, you never say never, but multiple founders beyond two is such an unstable and potentially treacherous situation that I would never, ever recommend going beyond two."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "But I do see value in the non technical sort of business and market and outside minded founder teaming up with the technical founder."}, {"time": 8394, "text": "There is a lot of merit to that, but there's a lot of danger in that less those two blow apart."}, {"time": 8399, "text": "Was it lonely for you?"}, {"time": 8400, "text": "Unbelievably."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "And that's the drawback."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "I mean, if you're a lone founder, there is no other person that you can sit down with and tackle problems and talk them through who has precisely or nearly precisely your alignment of interests."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "Your most trusted board member is likely an investor and therefore at the end of the day has the interest of preferred stock in mind, not common stock."}, {"time": 8426, "text": "Your most trusted VP, who might own a very significant stake in the company, doesn't own anywhere near your stake in the company."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "And so their long term interests may well be in getting the right level of experience and credibility necessary to peel off and start their own company."}, {"time": 8444, "text": "Or their interests might be aligned with jumping ship and setting up with a different company, whether it's a rival or one in a completely different space."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "So, yeah, being a lone founder is a spectacularly lonely thing."}, {"time": 8457, "text": "And that's a major downside to it."}, {"time": 8459, "text": "What about mentorship?"}, {"time": 8460, "text": "Because you're a mentor to a lot of people."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "Can you find an alleviation to that loneliness in the space of ideas with a good mentor?"}, {"time": 8469, "text": "With a good mentor or like a mentor who's mentoring you?"}, {"time": 8472, "text": "Yeah, you can a great deal, particularly if it's somebody who's been through this very process and has navigated it successfully and cares enough about you and your well being to give you beautifully unvarnished advice."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "That can be a huge, huge thing."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "That can assuage things a great deal."}, {"time": 8488, "text": "And I had a board member who was not an investor, who basically played that role for me to a great degree."}, {"time": 8495, "text": "He came in maybe halfway through the company's history, though."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "I would have needed that the most in the very earliest days."}, {"time": 8503, "text": "Yeah, the loneliness, that's the whole journey of life."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "We're always alone, alone together."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "It pays to embrace that."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "You were saying that there might be something outside of the founder

8524, "text": "And great founder is thing number one, but then thing number two, and it's ginormous, is a great team."}, {"time": 8530, "text": "And so I said so much about the founder because one hopes or one believes that a founder who is a great hirer is going to be hiring people and in charge of critical functions like engineering and marketing and biz dev and sales and so forth, who themselves are great hirers."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "But what needs to radiate from the founder into the team that might be a little bit different from what's in the gene code of the founder?"},

the team needs to have a slightly different thing, which is, you know, it's 99% obsession is execution, is to relentlessly hit the milestones, hit the objectives, hit the quarterly goals."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "That is, you know, 1% vision."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "You don't want to lose that."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "But execution machines, you know, people who have a demonstrated ability and a demonstrated focus on, yeah, I go from point to point to point."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "I try to beat and raise expectations relentlessly, never fall short, and, you know, both sort of blaze and follow the path."}, {"time": 8602, "text": "Not that the path is going to, I mean, blaze the trail as well."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "I mean, a good founder is going to trust that VP of sales to have a better sense of what it takes to build out that organization, what the milestones be."}, {"time": 8614, "text": "And it's going to be kind of a dialogue amongst those at the top."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "But, you know, execution obsession in the team is the next thing."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "Yeah, there's some sense where the founder, you know, you talk about sort of the space of ideas, like first principles thinking, asking big difficult questions of like future trajectories or having a big vision and big picture dreams."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "You can almost be a dreamer, it feels like, when you're like not the founder, but in the space of sort of leadership."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "But when it gets to the ground floor, there has to be execution, there has to be hitting deadlines."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And sometimes those are attention."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "There's something about dreams that are attention with the pragmatic nature of execution."},

execution in the software world, that would be the programmer or the designer."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "Amongst many other things, you're an incredible conversationalist, a podcast, you host a

deliberately and methodically and willfully, as when I do it, or whether that just emerges from the conversation."}, {"time": 8721, "text": "But something that's beautifully architected, that can create something that's incredibly powerful and memorable, or something where there's just extraordinary chemistry."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "And so with All In, or I'll go way back."}, {"time": 8735, "text": "You might remember the NPR show Car Talk, I couldn't care less about auto mechanics myself."}, {"time": 8743, "text": "But I love that show because the banter between those two guys was just beyond, it was without any parallel, right?"}, {"time": 8750, "text": "And some kind of edgy podcasts like Red Scare is just really entertaining to me because the banter between the women on that show is just so good, and All In and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 8759, "text": "So I think it's a combination of sort of the arc and the chemistry."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "And I think because the arc can be so important, that's why very, very highly produced podcasts like This American Life, obviously a radio show, but I think of a podcast because that's how I always consume it, or Criminal, or a lot of what Wondery does and so forth."}, {"time": 8781, "text": "That is real documentary making, and that requires a big team and a big budget relative to the kinds of things you and I do, but nonetheless, then you got that arc, and that can be really, really compelling."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "But if we go back to conversation, I think it's a combination of structure and chemistry."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "Yeah, and I've actually personally have lost, I used to love This American Life, and for some reason because it lacks the possibility of magic, it's engineered magic."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "I've fallen off of it myself as well."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "I mean, when I fell madly in love with it during the aughts, it was the only thing going."}, {"time":

that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 8851, "text": "Is there something that stands out in your mind that you can draw an insight from?"}, {"time": 8855, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this no way diminishes the episodes that will not be the answer to these two questions, but an example of something that was really, really challenging to prepare for was George Church."}, {"time": 8868, "text": "So as I'm sure

company, Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies is making it so that there's just gonna be an enormous amount of investigations into all these different psychedelics."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "But what we're gonna see is the development of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about that have not existed yet because a lot of these for profit companies are gonna wanna invent and patent and have composition of matter patents on new molecules."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So I think we'll see a lot of that

think that that's a possibility."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "There was Stan Groff, who's the world's leading LSD researcher and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "They were talking about stories that they had heard about MDMA that people take and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And so you get this ego dissolution, but underneath it, you have this sense of ego, sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance, kind of grounds it."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry, that you can watch without the terror of the ego dissolution, the sense that you're losing your mind or you're going crazy or you're dying, or that you have this grounded sense of safety while you're dissolving your normal sense of how you see things."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person, as opposed to sort of this manual potion that's through experiment."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Although I don't know about fine tuning things to the person in the sense that we believe there's this inner healer, this kind of inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "We talked about it, the body repairs itself."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "So I think we more need to create safety for people and then what emerges will be customized to what they need to be looking at from this inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "At the same time, we will move to, we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents and you do like personalized chemotherapy."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I think we will have more like personalized psychedelic therapy, but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs that people go through over an extended period of time and then you kind of customize what's next and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations or psilocybin MDMA combinations."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Chemistry is not my strength."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "I'm more into clinical applications and policy, but I can say that from what I've learned from reading from others and research done by others that different psychedelics have an impact on different neurotransmitters, different other parts of energies in the brain."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "The default mode network is what's considered to be like our sense of self and it's part of the brain that sort of is what I described before, scanning the world and filtering information for what's really important to us and both focusing us on things and also helping us to ignore a lot of things."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD and first synthesized psilocybin on what they call structure activity relationships."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "What is the structural molecule and then how do you predict what that new molecule that never existed before is going to do once you actually take it?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And you can get close, but you never really know until you actually take the drug."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And the way that Sasha ran his experiments is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses and he would sort of step up the doses to have more experiences."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "If he thought it was valuable, he'd share it with his wife, Ann, but then what they would do is if they both thought it was valuable, they had a group of 12 people that they were with for many, many years and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people and they would get the different perspectives."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "So there's still a lot of mysteries as far as structure activity relationships and it's not gonna be the case that people go into the lab and they tinker with molecules and they know exactly what they're gonna get."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And a lot of it has to do with not so much chemistry as morphology."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "You could say the shape of the molecule and how does that interact with receptor sites."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And so we're getting better at modeling all of that."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And how does that interaction relate to the morphing of the human experience and deeply understanding that perhaps there's no equations yet for that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And over time and sort of subjective self report, like trying to build an understanding of the effects of the different chemistries."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982 and this was after I had done lots of LSD and mescaline and mushrooms, I was shocked at how different it was than these other substances and yet how profound it was."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So are there whole new kind of categories of classes of drugs that we're not aware of that would be not so much this like eco dissolution or emotional?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala, the fear processing part of the brain."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy throughout the brain in a different way."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "So you think more logically, that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA."},

longterm memory."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past, it's always about to happen."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So will we one time develop drugs that would even be specific to certain kinds of memories?"}, {"time": 2023, "text": "We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda, who is at the Bronx VA, and she's done some studies that are with the epigenetics of

generations."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Sort of like set points for anxiety, fear, certain things like that."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "But the question is, can you actually transmit memories from one generation to the next?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "Now, this is not DNA changes which happen over a very long period of time and evolutionary scale."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "But within one lifetime,

generation to generation, either by the father or the mother through the sperm or the egg."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "So it's pretty remarkable."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So what Rachel's gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD and look at these epigenetic markers before and after and see if they change as a consequence of therapy."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals that will be able to bring certain kind of memories to the surface?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "That's not inconceivable."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "The epigenetic angle is fascinating, that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations that lead to memories living from one generation to the other and then bringing those memories to the surface and using that as signal to

we store all these memories and in the stories that we get passed out."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Especially with a lot of shared, you talk about the Holocaust or World War II, where it's deeply ingrained in the culture, the impact of those events and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives on that particular event create a set of stories that you can plug into."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you that creates a memory that's connected to, like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust, I think about my own family, but in some sense, it's also resonating with stories of many others."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So it's like somehow the two echo each other and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top."}, {"time":

people can be incredibly vicious and can be very motivated by irrational factors."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And so I just feel that this kind of multi generational transmission of this story of the

journey that reveals so much?"}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Well, I was with a group of people."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT, have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes, and everybody else was just chatting, and then the person who did the DMT would come back and tell their story of what happened."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And then we'd think about it for a bit and then pass the pipe to the next person."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And so this was like a whole evening."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "So even the, sorry to interrupt, even the conversations themselves then is part of the experience."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Exactly, yes, yes, because it's also what you bring back."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "It's not so much about what the experience is, but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "And then also, how do you learn how to do these things on your own without the drugs?"}, {"time": 2574, "text": "There is this way, because we're saying it's sort of a core human experience, the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And once you've seen it and felt it, then you have a little bit better sense to recreate it on your own."}, {"time": 2588,

{"time": 2599, "text": "So there's this way in which we do that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I would say that from the DMT experience, the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at with this, the group of us and this group of friends trying to do this common exploration, that if you have this sense of safety, you're incredibly vulnerable because you are giving up your awareness really of what's happening around you."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I think there's, what we're finding is that in our psychedelic research for PTSD and what we see with the vaccines, that even African Americans are reluctant to volunteer for vaccines because they haven't had that sense of safety from the medical establishment."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So the overlay has to be this sense of safety as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "And so one of the, Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work on helping people in prison with trauma, potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "But one of the exercises was teaching people to, okay, here's how you deal with stress, just close your eyes and deep breathe."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes in prison, you don't feel safe to do that."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So all that is just to say is that the context is the most important factor."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "So while I'll talk about the DMT experience, the context was this supportive sense of safety that I could be completely vulnerable and out of any kind of controlled women, I think often are less safe in this way than men because of all the sexual assaults."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline to some extent, it opens you up to much more."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And to make a bigger point of that, we could say that it's very similar to the

"Father Bruno burned at the stake."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Actually, one of the things he said, I think that's worth all these years later saying is that when the inquisition sentenced him to burn at the stake for espousing this idea that the earth was not really the center of the universe, he said to the inquisition, he said, your fear in sentencing me is greater than my fear in being sentenced."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "That their worldview was so rigid that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "And so this idea of psychedelics displacing

"text": "So in that place of safety and vulnerability in that fascinating group of people, when their ego was dissolved in this way, did they have similar experiences?"}, {"time": 2829, "text": "Is there different places that their minds went?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience that Hitler's part of me, no one else in the group had that."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before or they realized that they're not just the good, the white hat, good people and that they're all good and we got to fight against the bad people."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So no, people will go in different places."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And not only that, if you do it again, you'll go into a different place than you went to the first time."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Unless you have not resolved the issue."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult, but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum, the same challenge that I was unable to overcome."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving, letting the ego fully go."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And I would have this sequence of trips over a couple of months where I would reach this point where I was too scared to move forward and I would just be holding on."}, {"time": 2891, "text":

emotion."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And what that means is if you can fully let in something, then the essence of life has changed, is that it moves on, that everything's in motion."}, {"time": 2915,

"text": "This full experience of something is this funeral pyre of that emotion."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And so that runs against a lot of what modern psychiatry is doing too, which is to suppress symptoms."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "Instead of supporting people to kind of explore these insecurities so that then they can contain them and then they can move on."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "Although one of the reasons why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA or why there's advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience is that you have a lot of opportunities to come up against this resistance that may be too difficult to deal with and then you kind of push it aside and then a couple hours later you come back to it or you come back to it."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Press snooze every once in a while if you're not ready."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "It's hard to do that."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "I think with MDMA, you can negotiate."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "That's, I think, a part of its safety in a sense."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this or I'm feeling this, but it's too much for me now."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "You can push it away."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "But with the classic psychedelics, this kind of membrane between the conscious and the unconscious, that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane and things are coming up, it's very difficult to negotiate with it."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "The key to successful classic psychedelic trips is surrender."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "You've talked about that you first began to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part under the influence of LSD."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey, in writing that incredible book?"}, {"time": 3039, "text": "Yeah, there's a process that's called semantic priming."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "And so what that means is that I say night, you say day."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "There's kind of normal patterns of kind of, you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And so they've done some research."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "They, meaning scientists, have done some research where you give people a psychedelic and then you do this semantic priming."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "And what you find is they have a wider range of associations than they normally would when they're not under psychedelics."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So I think for Ken Kesey, he was able with psychedelics to get a deeper kind of emotional connection to some of these states of mind that people were in this mental institution and that he could explore them more in depth and more eloquently."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And also one of the things he talked about was the fog machine, was how people's minds were sort of clouded by the people that ran the institution and the fog machine would be coming in."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "So I think the imagery and the metaphors that he used a lot in the book could come to him during LSD experiences."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And then now he wasn't doing very, when you're writing, you have to be literate."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "You have to be able to write."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips instead of at the peak."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "But I think you would get a lot of these, the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors, I think he would get these extent, also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended focus and you can really elaborate on images."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And so much of psychedelic experiences are poetic and metaphorical."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "I mean, you could take veterans who've never read a book of poetry in their lives."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And under the influence of MDMA, just what they describe, the imagery and the way they describe their experiences, metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel what LSD did to his mind in a way that most people couldn't do, that he did because he was trying to write this novel and because he was so brilliant."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics and treating, in bringing some of trauma to the surface and dealing with all those kinds of things, but there's something also to the opening up of creativity for whether it's for writing purposes or for in my world for engineering, for invention, innovation and invention itself is a very, is a deeply creative process."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics, what kind of ideas can be brought to life?"}, {"time": 3237, "text": "Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley and else microdosing psychedelics in order to have a little touch more of this creative approach to things."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "I think, of course, you start with helping people deal with trauma, and then the next step is people who have moved past their trauma and are trying to do something, create something special in their life."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "How can then psychedelics empower that?"}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Yeah, now, that also, just to not shy away from anything controversial, that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest, particularly for younger people."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "You know, when you're sort of moving into this adulting kind of phase and you have to figure out what are you gonna do with your life, there's so many options."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "A lot of people, of course, feel constrained that they have very few options, but I think this idea of psychedelics as a way to help you find your calling or find your vision or find your unique leverage point, I think we'll see that more and more as our culture evolves and gets healthier around the use of psychedelics."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So it's both the science, having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely and the culture catching up to the fact that this is both safe and very useful."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "So we can understand physiological risks and we can minimize them."},

"Psychological risks are harder to address, but we can do that through the sense of safety and support."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "But I think there's a level of risk there that we shouldn't overlook."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "And so to make a drug into a medicine, what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies that things are safe and efficacious."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "But even though they use those words, proving safety and safe and efficacious, it's in relationship to the disease that you're trying to treat and you accept a certain amount of risk."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "So it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer because fascinating him being."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "He was also part of Project MKUltra."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "What was Project MKUltra and what lessons we should take away from it?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "What they were looking at was, can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs, and weaponize them in different ways for interrogation, for true serums, for exposing somebody before they give a big talk to something like LSD and then they can't talk or make a fool of themselves?"}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons and then you just walk up and nobody dies and you've won the battle?"}, {"time": 3484, "text": "So it's a fascinating concept."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance and I think that's how it's."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "One way to win a war is to enforce peace."}, {"time": 3496,

into your friend."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "Yeah, but MKUltra was really nefarious and it was part of our military and it was done in secret and they would dose people against their will."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "I mean, one of the most infamous things was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco and they would have one way mirrors, all this stuff and then they would just dose people with LSD and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD and observe what they would do and how they would act."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And the CIA actually for a while was dosing each other secretly and that there's a famous case of this fellow Olson that either jumped out of a window or was pushed, he might've been killed."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "He was a CIA guy and they gave him LSD and then they're trying to see can they break him down and get him to tell secrets."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him while he was under the influence of LSD and whether he was pushed or not, I don't know if we'll ever know."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "But MKUltra was violating people's human rights."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "It was done in secret and the irony of it is that Ken Kesey is one of the people, one of the main early people that got LSD in this context and then he was one of the main people that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics to oppose the Vietnam War."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "So I think the CIA kind of in many cases, things get out of their control, what they think they can do and it turned in to be a disaster for them."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "I think there was some thought that some of the people at the CIA had is that if you can turn people inside, take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience, they're not gonna be involved politically."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "It's a way to sort of take people offline."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And what I don't think they counted on is that when you're offline and you have these unit of special experiences and you realize how we're all connected, then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese and put one dictator over another dictator, dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Why are we doing that?"}, {"time": 3642, "text": "So MKUltra has just a very disreputable."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "We're learning more and more about what they did and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping to organize and out of that emerged, you could say just this incredible psychedelic culture."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "And you look at the bands that began in the 60s and which ones have really survived to this day and the Grateful Dead has survived longer than most any other band."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "But can we talk about the darkness a little bit?"}, {"time": 3716, "text": "So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly part of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Do you think this is true?"}, {"time": 3725, "text": "Do you think it had an impact on him psychologically, intellectually and so on?"}, {"time": 3729, "text": "I do think it's true and I do think it had an impact."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "So we talked before about are these drugs somehow or other producing a certain kind of drug experience or do they bring out what's within?"}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So we have this experience, yeah, on the one hand, Ken Kesey and he sort of took positive things out of this."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "On the other hand, we can get this opposition to the modern world, to technology and to the point of creating bombs to try to go after it."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "So that the experience is not in the drug, it's this interaction between the drug, the person, the context."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "And so we can heal people with psychedelics or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "It depends again on the context."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "And so I think both these things can be true."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And I think it was really good that you kind of highlighted this, that there is this polarities and that it's not in the drug, it's in the other factors and it's who they were beforehand and then how you use that experience."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water and everybody were to get it, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden everybody's gonna have a mystical experience and then that's all we need to do and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "It's not about the drug."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "And that actually is why for me, we've also talked about engineering new psychedelics and all the people that are gonna be trying for profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "For me, the most important challenge is new cultural contexts that can create legality, safety, support for the existing psychedelics that we already have."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "I mean, we have so much incredible tools in these existing psychedelics that it's more about creating context for them to be used in safe medical or personal growth or recreational even with harm reduction, all these different ways."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "That's more important to me than finding some new molecule that's somewhat similar or somewhat different but it can be patented."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "So it's the social context."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra and I think it affected him in a negative way and that's a cautionary tale that it's not in the drug, it's in the context."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "The context, the person, still it feels like if viewed from a therapy perspective, perhaps there was a way to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path out of the darkness."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "I think so and I think that this is where I think MDMA comes in in a way that MDMA is, he felt very isolated and very much out of society in some ways."},

MDMA, they're solitary creatures except mating season, which is not very often but you give them MDMA and they become more interested in hanging out with other octopuses."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "So I think this, for people that have had difficult psychedelic experiences, MDMA helps them integrate them."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "We've worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience 40 years before and are still able to get back to that under the influence of MDMA and work out some of the conflicts that they weren't able to resolve all those decades before."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "So I think that psychedelics could have been helpful in a different context for Ted Kaczynski."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "But the other big part of it is that people have to be willing to cooperate with the experience."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "We talked about resistance."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "So people can resist these things."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "It's the saying is you can bring a

this idea of empowering people to heal themselves."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "And so if Ted Kuznicki had been in a therapeutic setting with psychedelics and if they'd had something like MDMA available

{"time": 4198, "text": "And LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting, not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "Sometimes he used to say that if they never got into LSD, they'd still be at Harvard with the psilocybin."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "So he was a great American psychologist, but then he got tired of the psychology game, you could say, or he would say that."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "He got more and more interested in cultural change and various musicians and artists and all sorts of people started coming to him for the psychedelic experience that they are in a way for creativity, for other things."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "So he started hanging out with all sorts of famous people or creative people and he stopped going to classes a lot."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "And Ram Dass, Richard Alpert had given LSD to a student that Ram Dass was courageous enough to admit that he had a sexual interest in."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "They weren't supposed to give it undergraduates."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "That was about the only time that they ever did it."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "And psychedelics just getting more and more controversial even in the early 60s, eventually got kicked out of Harvard and then he became kind of a cultural icon for the counterculture and was hounded by the police and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail."},

4308, "text": "It's a spectrum of sorts."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Yeah, I think that Leary was someone who a little bit got addicted to media attention."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "But I think that overall he gets blamed a lot for the backlash against the 60s, the shutdown of psychedelic research."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "I think when you look back at the 60s, the common narrative is that it was because psychedelics going wrong."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "People took psychedelics, they weren't prepared, they had emotional breakdowns, they weren't psychotic, they killed themselves, they did this or that, different problems of people taking psychedelics in context that they didn't feel fairly safe in or just they weren't prepared or they didn't know how much they were taking or all this."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "But I think the real reason, while that did happen, I think the real reason is psychedelics going right and people having this sense of connection."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping that it would kind of turn people inward and take them away from political struggles, it actually motivated people."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences, your attitude towards death changes also this idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life, it's a natural cycle, it's not so much."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "So I think people realize that, while there's this billions of years of evolution, infinity, whatever that means in terms of time, that we're here for a very limited time and they end up wanting to use their time well, they have a lessened fear of death and they wanna build this paradise on earth here now instead of later."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "So a lot of people really did get motivated to challenge the Vietnam War, to work on the environmental movement, civil rights movement, women's rights movement, anti militarism."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And it was that challenge to the status quo that caused the backlash."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "So Leary is someone who in 1990, we had the maps I started in 86."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So in 1990, we had this conference to raise money out in California and Leary was there and Ram Dass was there and Ralph Metzner was there and Andy Weil was there and Terrence McKenna was there and Dennis McKenna was there and all these."}, {"time": 4444,

far past asking for permission for anything, but I'm glad that you're doing it."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "And then he held up my hand like passing the torch."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "So it was, and that's one of my favorite photographs of me and Tim where he's sort of like, but it was after this, fuck the government."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "I'm so far past asking for permission for anything, but I'm glad that you are."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "Now I did follow ups to the Good Friday experiment and I did follow ups, 25 year follow up to the Good Friday experiment, about a 34 year follow up to the Concord Prison experiment."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "What I discovered in some ways I would say is the key to the 60s, what I just told you, but in the follow up to the Good Friday

enormous challenge because their names were all lost and it just took forever years and years and years to find them all."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "But I discovered that those people that had the psilocybin experience in the midst of 25 years later with Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan, and if there ever were there a social pressure to disavow the validity of the psychedelic experience, that was then."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "And instead they affirmed it, that they thought with all of this years of hindsight, now looking back, they thought it was a valid mystical experience."}, {"time":

their strategy."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "But he was interested in the political implications of the mystical experience."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "So he permitted this experiment to take place."},

the court of public opinion and winning in the court."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "The DEA freaked out and the emergency scheduled MDMA in 85."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "The handwriting was on the wall that they were not gonna permit the therapeutic use to continue because it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war and these are terrible drugs."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "So in 86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma because the strategy that I realized is that Americans are open to medicines, that tools to ease suffering, that was the opening wedge, the opening door to changing attitudes."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "And it would be through science."}, {"time": 4878, "text": "I would say that my religion is more science than anything else."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "And

that we're all connected."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "And then if we realize that we're all connected, we're not gonna blow up the world."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "So a lot of people say that if we could just give LSD all to the world leaders, that would be, then they'd have these spiritual experiences, the world would be better."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "But I actually had a ketamine

would just sort of ratchet up in intensity like these vibrations."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "And I realized there's no way to get into his head."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "This idea we've talked about before about you have to be willing."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "So what that sort of helped me understand is that the strategy has to be mass mental health."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "It's not about changing a few leaders."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "We need to change the mass of humanity to this new mode of thinking, this new spiritual way."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "So MAPS was a nonprofit

in December of 2014, we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "So MAPS is a nonprofit, but in our 35 years, we've raised about $110 million in donations."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "What I didn't know when I started MAPS, and it took me quite a few years, I didn't even know this till about eight, nine years ago, was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill to create incentives for developing drugs that were off patent."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "It's in the public domain."}, {"time": 5163,

generic."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And that will effectively be, well, it's five years, you do pediatric studies, you get six months extension, and we are being required, if we succeed in adults, to work with adolescents with PTSD."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "It blocks a generic competitor from applying till that five and a half years is over, takes FDA at least six months to review."}, {"time": 5193, "text": "So more or less six years of data exclusivity, 10 years in Europe is data exclusivity."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "So the story then became to the donors that you're not gonna have to give us money forever because we can make money selling MDMA, but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, but the other is marketing drugs."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "When you market it with the profit maximization motive, we end up in the extreme getting the distortions that we have in America, where we have the

people or so don't have insurance, and it's just very inequitable."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "So what we're trying to do is show a different way to market drugs."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "And it's a modification of capitalism that's called the benefit corporation, where you maximize public benefit, not profit."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "You still make a profit."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "So selling MDMA for a profit is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit because it's taxable, it's a business."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "So we've created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation, which is 100% owned by the nonprofit."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "And the mission of that pharma company is to maximize not profit, but maximize benefit for society."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Although there still will be profits, and the profits that we're gonna make are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS, which is again, is this mass mental health and ending the drug war."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group to help us plot our commercialization strategy."},

insurance companies will cover it."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "But there's the possibility of somewhere in the range of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits during this period of data exclusivity, just from the US and we're talking about trying to do this research around the world as well."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "So that's what the Benefit Corporation is."}, {"time": 5325,

passed the Oregon psilocybin initiative."}, {"time": 5358, "text": "So in those areas where maybe more people are gonna gravitate to do psychedelics, we want there to be harm reduction so that we

demonstrate safety."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "We also figured out that our measure, the CAPS, the Clinician Administrative PTSD Scale, that it's the gold standard all over the world for measuring

we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA, that people do score fairly high on the scales of mystical experience, not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics, but they do score pretty high on average."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "And a significant number of them have over the cutoff for what would be considered a full mystical experience."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "So enough to say that we could look at a correlation and we didn't find any."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "The other thing that we discovered, and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally, is that my

how to do the double blind study."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And I thought I'd solve the problem and I persuaded my dissertation committee that I'd solve the problem."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "And everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA, most of these people have never done it before, they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "And then the challenge is to pick a dose that's high enough so that there is this confusion, but not so high that it's so therapeutic that we can't tell the difference between the groups."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams, 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 125 and 150."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong and that there is no good solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "What we found is that, to our surprise actually, was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "We didn't think that."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "I mean, the normal dose is like, full dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "But 75 milligrams was an effective dose."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "And we discovered that the lower doses, so I was half right, you could say, the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50, they could produce enough confusion that you could say that they were successful at blinding, not perfectly, but enough confusion so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "But what we discovered, again, to our surprise, was that the low doses made people uncomfortable."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "And so people still got better with the therapy with low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo, they did even better than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA."},

"People didn't like it."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "But we would still help them make some progress."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So we had the blinding, but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "And so the real question is, if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?"}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So we went to the FDA, and so this was what we discovered during phase two."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting, and we said, we can give you blinding, but it will make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "That will cause a problem because most people will be able to tell what they've got."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "What Tom Loughran, a doctor who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA is our main advisor."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So the first thing he said is that the double blind fails in practice a lot, even with SSRIs, because there's certain side effects that you have with these drugs."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "And the doctors who are doing these research when you're reporting your side effects, they can say, oh, that's probably, you got the active drug instead of the placebo."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So the double blind is in theory is terrific, but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches that they think are important to reduce bias."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "The first one is easy to do."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "It's called random assignment."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "So sometimes there are studies where you'll treat a bunch of people with something and some fraction of them will get better and some won't."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better, who volunteers to get this new treatment?"}, {"time": 6631, "text": "And then you give them the new treatment, but the people that volunteer are more likely to wanna get better."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "They're not representative sample of everybody that has."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "So when you have random assignment, everybody is similarly motivated and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "So that's what we told, of course we need random assignment."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "The other part was when the bias double blind doesn't work as well, then the system of independent raters is especially important of how you do that."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them, and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests to make sure that they evaluate this, so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient and then they're supposed to rate them according to their symptoms."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And then we sort of make sure that we've got this calibrated rater pool and it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine, and they're randomly assigned to the next person that needs a rating."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "So they said 20 raters."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "So we've got like 20 raters and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater sees each patient only once, maybe twice, but not tracking them through the study."}, {"time": 6707, "text": "So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters that they don't know where this person is in the study."}, {"time": 6714, "text": "And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple, who's like the old wise man at the FDA."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "He's been there since 1972."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy and they brought him into the final meeting of this process where we are trying to design phase three."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three, that was November 29th, 2016, we then negotiated for eight months on the design of phase three and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "This process of design."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "To the extent that I have any artistic creativity, it's in protocol design."},

biased."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And so how do you, there's something beautiful about the scientific process designed to get you to the truth."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Especially when that scientific process is trying to get to the truth of the human organism, which is so complicated."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So it's very difficult to dissect, to get the strong effects."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "And when you're analyzing, when you have like raters, they're watching a video."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "Yeah, very much so."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "And so we came to this agreement with FDA though that we would use this independent rater pool."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so we learned in phase two again, that the double blind, there was no solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in the end agreed that the best design was therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA, accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "Most therapists will be able to tell the difference, but that makes a harder test for us to show a difference between the two groups because we're giving them inactive placebo and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "So once we started phase three, so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out was the results of our first phase three study."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "We came to agreement with FDA that we would do two phase three studies, each would have 100 persons in them."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "And what the FDA said to us is that they thought that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers than they wanted to see for safety."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "The reason they said that is it in phase two, we had a large effect size."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "So from a statistical point of view, the bigger of an effect that you're looking for, the fewer number of people you need to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "When you're trying to find small differences, you need large numbers of people to sort of work out the noise."}, {"time": 6899, "text": "So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "And the idea is that it's very possible that the first study would show the efficacy because the effect is so strong."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "So one of the things we also realized when you work with a highly stigmatized drug in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition that we need highly sympathetic subjects and we need to make the best case we can, which means we need to work with the hardest cases so that this is really needed."}, {"time": 6938, "text": "And so we end up enrolling people."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "The first study was chronic severe PTSD."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "And unlike many studies of PTSD, we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "So we have multiple people that have tried to kill themselves that we felt like if we were to exclude them, what are we doing?"}, {"time": 6958, "text": "Those are the people that need it the most."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "So we came to this agreement with FDA."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients, including those that had attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And we would do these two 100 person studies."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis."}, {"time": 6979, "text": "So what that means is that when the study is underway, and often big, big studies, they have this kind of interim analysis where what you do is, and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people had reached the primary outcome measure and all 100 had been enrolled, then we would take a look at the data."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "And if the statistical analysis that we did was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose based on what we saw in phase two, the interim analysis is for what's called sample size reestimation."}, {"time": 7019, "text": "So what it means is if the results aren't as good as you thought they would, you can add more people."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "And then you'll get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it, but FDA will still approve it because FDA also believes that these are group averages."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "There may be some people that will later figure out respond better than others."},

"So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "And what we discovered to our delight was that we did not need to add any subjects."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "That's all we were told."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "We weren't told like, what is the results?"}, {"time": 7065, "text": "We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero, or you need to add X numbers of people to the study to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "That's right around the time that COVID hit and lockdowns happened."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "And we ended up negotiating with FDA that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "It took a while for us to end up doing that."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "So the paper that we just published is on the results of 90 people."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "I think it was 46 in the MDMA group, 44 in the placebo group."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "And what we discovered was that the study worked better than we had even hoped."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "So the first thing is that you look at statistical significance."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "You have to get 0.05, which basically means a nickel out of a dollar, a one in 20 chance that the difference between the two groups is due to some random factor rather than to your intervention."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy and then with inactive placebo and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "So you have to get 0.05."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "There's another measure that the FDA uses sometimes called robust, which means one in a thousand, instead of one in 20, one in a thousand."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "And if you get a robust results, 0.001, and you meet some other criteria, they might agree to approve the drug on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "Because when you think about it, a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study, a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study, you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "So that's pretty good."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "So robust 0.001 is even better than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "Outrageous, incredibly."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "So that's a measure of both the difference between the two groups and the variability."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability, that most people who got the MDA got quite a large amount of benefit from it."}, {"time": 7203, "text": "And most people who got the placebo were more or less in the same range as well."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "That's really exciting, by the way."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "I mean, I suppose it's exciting from a perspective of approval by the FDA."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it, but it's also exciting because it has a chance to help people that are truly suffering, yeah."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "Well, if we can get one in 10,000 in the first phase three study, chances are we can get one in 20 in the second."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "So it's really gonna be about safety for us in the second phase three study."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance, but you could have an effect that's not very significant."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "It's not clinically significant."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "You can have statistical significance without clinical significance."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And as I said, the more people you get in the study, you can find smaller and smaller differences between two groups."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size."}, {"time": 7267, "text": "So effect size is based on... That scale you mentioned?"}, {"time": 7271, "text": "Well, the scale of the effect size is based on standard deviations."}, {"time": 7277, "text": "So an effect size of one means that your results are one standard deviation away from the norm."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "That's considered very large."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size, that's considered small effect size."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "Medium is starting to be around 0.6 and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "There's two different ways to look at it."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference between your two groups."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And what that is for us, since one group had therapy and one had therapy plus MDMA, the placebo subtracted effect size is basically the effect of just the MDMA because you've kind of washed out the therapy."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "That was 0.91."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "So we had a large effect size, which was different."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Now, when we do the within group, meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy, look at their baseline and their outcomes."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "That's another way to look at it."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "That's 2.1 effect size."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "Two standard deviations away from the norm is enormous effect size."}, {"time": 7358, "text": "The other part is that we had no effect by site, which is very important."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada, 11 throughout the United States."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?"}, {"time": 7373, "text": "Because what that might mean is maybe you've got all your patients or most of your patients going to this one site, which is these highly experienced therapists and they're like hippies from way back and they're super experienced with psychedelics and they're getting great results, but nobody else gets good results."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "So we had no effect by site."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "That we've been able to train all these new therapists."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "We also discovered that there's a group that's considered to be very difficult to treat, which is called the dissociative subtype."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So when people are traumatized, one of the ways to psychologically survive that is you dissociate."}, {"time": 7418, "text": "It's like you're not there."}, {"time": 7421, "text": "When you do that though, it's hard to come back because when you come back, then you get all these painful memories and fearful."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "And so the extreme of that is called dissociative identity disorder, kind of like schizophrenia, almost dissociative identity."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype and those are considered to be the hardest to treat because the theory is that you need to be ego intact."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated with therapeutic outcomes."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And you need to be talking about what traumatized you and working through that and expressing it, letting it out, not keeping it in."}, {"time": 7458, "text": "So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder for them to get back into the event because they're so dissociated."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "What we showed is that those people did even better on average than everybody else."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "So that MDMA is integrative."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "It helps people who are so separate that they make even more rapid progress."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult for them to dissociate."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "Yeah, or you could say it made it easier for them to remember."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "To reverse the dissociation."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma so that you can have these unconscious memories or memories that you cannot remember or that you've suppressed so much, but they distort your view."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "Your filter of the world is distorted by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "People can't be trusted."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "It's always about to happen."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma, but by reducing the fear, then the memories can come to the surface."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "Then you can process them, let out the emotions, cry, scream, shake, whatever."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "And then through this MDMA effect on the amygdala and the hippocampus, it helps you store these memories into longterm storage so that they're not always about to happen."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "They're in the past."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "They're part of your story, but they're not the whole story."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Now, none of this would be enough unless safety."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "So from a safety perspective, what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study that attempted to kill herself twice during the study."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "There was another woman that was so worried that she might kill herself, that the therapy brought these things to the surface that she's been pushing away, that she checked herself into a hospital in order to avoid self harm."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "At the end of the study, what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group."}, {"time": 7571, "text": "We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group attempt to kill themselves."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "So the MDMA is really helpful for giving people a sense of hope and that they can somehow process this."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide."}, {"time": 7590, "text": "That's our big concern in the second phase three study."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "As I said, it's more gonna be about safety than about efficacy."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "We think we'll get the efficacy, but we're very concerned about safety."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "Because we had problems in the first phase three study of somebody trying to kill herself twice in the placebo group, it's the background for having PTSD."}, {"time": 7612, "text": "So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people in the MDMA group try to kill themselves or succeed in killing themselves than in the placebo group for the FDA to say, oh, this MDMA, it's too dangerous."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "We don't think that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "So the other findings from safety is that the side effects are transitory."}, {"time": 7633, "text": "They're minor, they're sweating or jaw clenching or a slight temperature increase."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And everybody that's been to a rave knows about it."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "Take an ecstasy, there are some side effects."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "But they're minor, they're transitory and there has been this massive problem of during the eighties, the nineties, NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic and that you take it and it's gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "It's gonna be major brain damage."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "It's gonna be significant functional consequences."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous."}, {"time": 7668, "text": "It should never even be researched."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "Nobody should even get it once because it's poison and brain damage."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "Well, we no longer believe that, that was exaggerated."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "That was in service of the drug war."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests before and after in two of our different sites and showed no decline in cognitive functioning."}, {"time": 7689, "text": "So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening and the doses that we use."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "There's no obvious functional consequences."},

"text": "So what we showed is the durability of the effect."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "We showed that 32% of the people that got the therapy without MDMA at two months after the last experimental session no longer had PTSD."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Just with the therapy, which is phenomenal because these are on average 14 years PTSD, one third had PTSD over 20 years."}, {"time": 7728,

more than twice as good."}, {"time": 7742, "text": "In phase two and in phase three, we're also gonna do the 12 month followup."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "That's not for the FDA."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "That's not for approvability."}, {"time": 7750, "text": "That's more for insurance companies because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "If it fades, if it's great results initially but then it fades after six months, what's the point?"}, {"time": 7760, "text": "And what we showed in phase two is that people keep getting better."}, {"time": 7768, "text": "At the two month followup, they're doing pretty well but at the 12 month followup, they're even better."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "So it's durable."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "People have learned how to process trauma."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "They keep getting better."}, {"time": 7779, "text": "So we've not reached that point in this phase three study where everybody's got their one year followup."}, {"time": 7783, "text": "But we have also done three and a half year followups to some of the groups that were in phase two and showed that it was durable."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "And we're doing a long term followup now to many of the people in phase two, some of them treated 15 years ago."}, {"time": 7797, "text": "So that's all more for the insurance companies."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "So basically what we found in the paper that we just published is that it was highly efficacious, highly significant, no effect by sight, works in the hardest cases and the safety record was great."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "That's an incredible success."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "And that's really exciting, especially given that the people who've committed, who attempted to commit suicide were let into the study."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "And so these are people who are truly suffering."}, {"time": 7830, "text": "I mean, that's incredibly exciting."}, {"time": 7836, "text": "And I mean, just to speak to the frustration why things can't move faster, but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "Is there other studies of this nature that you foresee enabling that same kind of positive impact, whether it's MDMA for other things like treating addiction, or maybe it's psilocybin for other conditions?"}, {"time": 7859, "text": "Is there something else that's promising?"}, {"time": 7861, "text": "Yeah, I think that what we've discovered I don't think is unique to MDMA."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "So it's MDMA assisted psychotherapy."},

it."}, {"time": 921, "text": "And that's like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration or exploring a scientific question."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And it's cool how the very thing that probably earned people the Nobel prize or, or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after they've won the prize."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's cool to see."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And they're rare humans, it seems."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last birthday, he was really into number theory and primes."}, {"time": 954, "text": "So what I did is I took like a photo of him picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I converted the picture into a bunch of one and eights."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I sent him that."}, {"time": 973, "text": "Oh, so the, the visual, like it's still look like the picture, it's made up of a prime."}, {"time": 978, "text": "That's tricky to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It's hard to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It looks harder than it actually is."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So the way you do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in ones."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And then there's... And then just keep flipping numbers until..."}, {"time": 990, "text": "But there's like some primality tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But what it gives you is like it excludes numbers that are not prime."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know if they are prime or not."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And then you run the full primality test on that."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So you just have to keep iterating on that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And it was, it's funny because when you got the picture, it was like, how did you do that?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "It was super curious too."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And then we got into the details."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And again, this was, it was already 90, I think 92 or something."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And that curiosity was still there."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So you can really see that in some of these scientists."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So could we talk about Fermat's library?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the main goal?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the dream?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence, right?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there and generally pretty hard to understand at times."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And the idea is that you can make them more accessible and easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the site, right?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step that is not completely obvious."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And then you can add more context to it."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way."}, {"time": 1084, "text":

come from different backgrounds, right?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "I studied CS, we studied physics."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so we'd read papers and present them to the each other."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And then we tried to bring some of that online."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And then over time, it kind of grew into something with a broader goal."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And really, what we're trying to do is trying to help move science in the right direction."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Well, so there's a lot to be said."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So first of all, for people who haven't seen it, the interface is exceptionally well done."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Execution is really important here."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me, don't know what LaTeX is."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So it's spelled like LaTeX."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So be careful googling it if you haven't before."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Type setting language?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "It's a type setting language where you're basically program, writing a program that then generates something that looks, from a typography perspective, beautiful."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And so a lot of academics use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I think there's like a bunch of communities that use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "That's, yeah, that's the main."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Because I'm collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And they don't know LaTeX."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And I'm being very zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's a little heartbreaking actually, because it actually, it's funny to say, but, and we'll talk about open science, actually, the bigger mission behind Fermat's library is like, really opening up the world of science to everybody."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Is these silly two facts of like one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word, is actually a barrier between them."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "That's like, it's like boring and practical in a sense, but it makes it very difficult to collaborate."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Just on that, like, I think there are some people that should have received like a Nobel Prize, but will never get it."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth, because of tech and LaTeX."},

was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book and yeah, with tech that people don't know."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "The reason why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's Last Theorem."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem,

a, b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the power of n equals to c to the power of n, if n is bigger than two."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So there's no solutions."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And a lot of the most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem."},

that you can release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And that was the origin story for for the name."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could inspire a solution or a communication that then leads to a solution."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And if you think about papers, like papers are, as Joan was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can read."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific

annotations."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But we've made that available for free to anybody that wants to use it."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And so folks use it at universities and for running journal clubs."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And so we've just made that freely available."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And then librarian is a browser extension that we developed that is sort of an overlay on top of archive."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So it's about bringing some of the same functionality around comments, plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able to very easily extract the references of a paper that you're looking at or being able to extract the bib deck in order to cite that paper yourself."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So it's an overlay on top of archive."}, {"time":

that would kind of maybe ruin it."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And so there's a subtle balance there."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And I don't know what aspects you can change about it."}, {"time": 1557,

who don't know."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science."}, {"time":

than physics and math on archive."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And there's also, which I don't know very much about, like a biology, medical version of that."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Bioarchive."},

the website of the journal."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So this is literally the longest upload period on the internet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And during those three years, their content is just locked."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites that are open to people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "And then you have other fields like machine learning, for instance, where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don't even wait before the papers go to journals before they start working on top of those papers."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "So they publish them on archive, then other people see them, they start working on that."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And archive did a really good job at building that core platform to host papers."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "But I think there's a really, really big opportunity in building more features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting papers."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So collaboration, annotations, and having other things apart from papers like code and other things."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Because, for instance, in the field like machine learning, there's a really big, as I mentioned, people start working on top of preprints, and they are assuming that preprint is correct."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "But you really need a way, for instance, to maybe, it's not peer review, but distinguish what is good work from bad work on archive."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "So like a commenting interface like librarian, it's useful for that so that you can distinguish that in a field that is growing so fast as machine learning."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And then you have platforms that focus, for instance, on just biology."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is a good example."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is also super interesting because there's actually an interesting experiment that was run in the 60s."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in the 60s, the NIH supported this experiment called the Information Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for researchers to share biology preprints via mail or using libraries."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "And that project in the 1960s got canceled six years after it started."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And it was due to intense pressure from the journals to kill that project because they were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal industry."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Crick was one of the famous scientists that opposed to the Information Exchange Group."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And it's interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers that appear first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And this was almost 50 years after that first experiment."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So you can see that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial version of a preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in biology as preprints."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So it delayed a lot that revolution."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "But now platforms like BioArchive are doing that work."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "But there's still a lot of room for growth there."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I think it's super important because those are the papers that are open that everyone can read."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "But if we just look at the entire process of science as a big system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So you have an idea, depending on the field, you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few experiments in computer science, there might be some code, there'd be a data set for, you know, some of the more sort of biology, psychology, you might be collecting the data set that's called, you know, a study, right?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So that's part of that, that's part of the methodology."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And so you are putting all that into a paper form."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you have some results."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you submit that to a place for review through the peer review process."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And there's a process where, how would you summarize the peer review process?"}, {"time": 1883, "text": "But it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And based on that, decide whether your paper is good or not."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "So there's a whole broken nature to it."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "At the same time, I love the peer review process when I buy stuff on Amazon, like for like the commenting system, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So there's a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And then there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the low effort collaboration, which is a comment."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Sometimes, as you've talked about, a comment can change everything."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe annotations, or even like contributing to the paper, you can think of like, collaborative updating of the paper over time."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "So there's all these possibilities for doing things better than they've been done."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Can we talk about some ideas in this space?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Some ideas that you're working on, some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Because it does seem that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Like, like, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I'm very grateful that we have it."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "But it just feels like, it's like 10 to 20 years."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Like, it doesn't feel like that's a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "The simplicity of it is a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It feels like it's a, it's a bug."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity to it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So I'm sorry, there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "Let's just pick random things that we can talk about."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Wikipedia, you know, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "It's, I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "Because if someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited encyclopedia, like a couple of years ago, like it would be, I don't know how many people would have said that that would have survived."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "I mean, it makes almost no sense."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It's like having a Google doc that everybody on the internet can edit."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And I don't know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And like you have, and then you have users, like there's one single

what makes Wikipedia successful."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could happen."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "And so that's one thing."}, {"time": 2058,

the discussion of everything else."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I also believe, I've seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of individuals contribute or revolutionized most of the community."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like if you create a really powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting for one person who is like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2097,

papers."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "No, Stack Overflow is another great example of that."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "And it's just, and those are both to do incredibly productive communities that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "And it's in a way, it's almost like, it's very counterintuitive that these communities would exist and thrive."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So how do we do that for science?"}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Do you have ideas there?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "Like what are the biggest problems that you see?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "You're working on some of them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "An example would be like the Polymath projects."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "So this is a kind of a social experiment that was created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And his idea was to try to prove that, is it possible to do mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So he decided to pick a couple of problems and test that."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And they found out that it actually is possible for specific types of problems, namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and go step by step."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind of reorganizing the house every once in a while."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then you make some progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "But they were actually able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress in terms of mathematics."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And so

review, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture here of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So if you look at what publishing means in a traditional journal, you have journals that pay authors for their articles, and then they might pay reviewers to review those articles."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And finally, they pay people or distributors to distribute the content."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "In the scientific publishing world, you have scientists that are usually backed by government grants."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "They are giving away their work for free in the form of papers."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And then you have other scientists that are reviewing their work."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "This process is known as the peer review process, again for free."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "And then finally, we have government backed universities and libraries that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So this is, for me, it's bizarre."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "You have the government that is funding the research, it's paying the salaries of the scientists, it's paying the salaries of the reviewers, and it's buying back all that product of their work again."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "And I think the problem with this system and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium is because of the way academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so in a lot of fields, the competition in academia is really insane."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So you have hundreds of PhD students, they are trying to get to a professor position and it's hyper competitive."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And the only way for you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals with a high impact factor."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "In computer science, it's often conferences are also very prestigious or actually more prestigious than journals now."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So that's the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "But like NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least as prestigious as the journals."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "But it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "The process is what it is."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "But so you can really think that the problem with the impact factor is that it's a way to turn papers into accounting units."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And let me unpack this because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "Because papers are born with impact even before anyone reads them."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So the researchers, they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper is going to have a long term impact on the world."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published so that they get that value upfront."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "So for me, that is one of the problems of that."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And that really creates a tyranny of metrics."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you want to hire is people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact factors because that will increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge more for tuition, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas, that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "There's a really interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "It's a book by a researcher called Mario Biagioli."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "It goes a lot into how the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early work of looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations from a descriptive point of view."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So what they wanted to create was a map."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And that map would create a visual representation of influence."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So citations would be links between papers."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And ideally, what they would show, they would represent is that you read someone else's paper and it had an impact on your research."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "They weren't supposed to be counted."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I think this inspired Larry and Sergey's work for Google."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I think they even mentioned that."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "But what happens is, as you start counting citations, you create a market."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And the work of Eugene Garfield was a big inspiration for Larry and Sergey and for the PageRank algorithm that led to the creation of Google."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "And they even recognized that."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "And if you think about it, it's like the same way there's a gigantic market for search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the PageRank and how a web page will rank on Google."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The same will happen for papers."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "People will try to optimize the impact factors and the citations that they get."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And that creates a really big problem."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And it's super interesting to actually analyze them."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "If you look at the distribution of the impact factors of journals, you have like Nature."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Nature, I believe, is in the low 40s."},

2600, "text": "And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And you can really see two economies here."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known, where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "What I want to do is increase the ranking of my university."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And so they end up publishing as many papers as they can in journals with low impact factor."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the global south."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And then you have the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And there are also problems here in the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So if you look at the journal like Nature, so with impact factor in the low 40s, there's no way that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor by just grabbing the attention of scientists."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "What I mean by that is for the journals, the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So they need to make it to the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "They need to be captured by the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And because that's the only way for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And that, of course, creates problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or abstracts or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be, you know, sustained by the data or the content of the paper."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And you'll have clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And again, this is all a consequence of science or metrics."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And this is a very dangerous cycle that

significantly improved?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing, I don't know, computer parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones, which are not."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "In that same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas, in the space of science, it feels like that those metrics would be a little bit better."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Sort of when it's significantly more open to the crowdsource nature of the internet, of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to, like my biggest problem with peer review has always been that it's like five, six, seven people, usually even less."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And it's often, nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole process."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Meaning it's anonymous in a way that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or incentivize great work."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And also it doesn't necessarily have to be anonymous."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Like there has to be, the entire system is, doesn't encourage actual sort of rigorous review."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "For example, like open review does kind of incentivize that kind of process of collaborative review, but it's also imperfect."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "But it just feels like the thing that Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product, it feels like that could be applied to science where the same kind of thing you're doing with Fermat's library, but doing at a scale that's much larger."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "It feels like that should be possible given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that's getting, for example, I personally, as a person

of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only reviewer, one of five, then I better be like an expert in the thing."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "But if I, and I've learned this with COVID, which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst to contribute to the review process and a particular little aspect of a paper and be able to comment, be able to sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented or to enrich the ideas that are presented."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process would be able to allow you to have metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much better representative of its actual impact in the world, of its actual value to the world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary, gamified version of its impact."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "I think there's definitely the possibility, at least for a more resilient system than what we have today."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And I think that's kind of what you're describing, Alex."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I mean, to an extent, we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg uncertainty principle."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "When you pick a metric, as

metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they'll work as a better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "But I guess down the line, the underlying problem you're saying is there's a shortage of positions in academia."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "That's a big problem for me."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And that, and so they're going to be constantly

mentioning, breaking it down, maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "But this is definitely a problem."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "And the peer review

hard to break it."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "There are a couple of really interesting things that are being done right now."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "There are a couple of, for instance, journals

problem there is getting to critical mass."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So it's again, convincing the researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those

high profile scientists of people like Tim Gowers."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "They are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And so that you can try to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by force, like ban paid journals."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like what exactly are they contributing to the world?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like basically making it illegal to forget the fact that it's mostly

{"time": 4611, "text": "And so they decided to build a tunnel, and they decided to try to do it quickly."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "And so they started digging from both ends at the same time through the mountain."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult problem."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And this is like sixth century BC, so you had very limited access to the mathematical tools that you had at the time, were very limited."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And so what this paper is about is about the story of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years, kind of the accepted explanation of how they built it was actually wrong."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And so this tunnel has been famous for a while."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "There are a number of historians that talked about it since ancient Egypt."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "And the method that they described for building it was just wrong."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "And so these researchers went there and were able to figure that out."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And so basically, kind of the way that they thought they had built it was basically, if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top, and you have the mountain and then you have both entrances."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And the way they did it is like they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each entrance that are proportional to that big triangle."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "And then you kind of have arrows pointing in each way."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "And then you know at least that you have a line going through the mountain that connects both entrances."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "The issue with that is like once you go to this mountain and you start thinking of doing this, you realize that especially given that the tools that they had at the time, that your error margin would be too small."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "You wouldn't be able to do it."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Just the fact of trying to build this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you would end up missing."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "You'd start building these tunnels and they would miss each other."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So the task ultimately is to figure out like really perfectly as close as possible the direction you should be digging."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "First of all that it's possible to have a straight line through and then what that the direction would be."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle by doing."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "I'm not exactly sure about how to do that rigorously like by tracing the mountain, by walking along the mountain."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "You said grids?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Yeah you kind of walk as if you were in a grid and so you just walk in right angles."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "But then you have to walk really precisely then."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "You have to use tools to measure this and the terrain is probably a mess."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "So this makes more sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "So okay gotcha."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "But so this method was described by like an ancient Egyptian historian."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "I think hero of Alexandria."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And then for about like yeah for about 2000 years that's how we thought that they had built this tunnel."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "And then these researchers went there and found out that actually they must have had to use other methods."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "And then in this paper they describe these other methods and of course they can't know for sure."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "But there's they present a bunch of plausible alternatives."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "The one that for me was is the most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that is similar to an iron sight on a rifle."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "The way you can line up your rifle with a target off in the distance by having an iron sight."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "And they must have done something similar to that effectively with three sticks."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain that were all on the same height."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "And so that then you could get to the other side and you could and then you could draw that line."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So this for me is the most plausible way that they might have done that."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "But then they described this in detail and other possible approaches in this paper."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So this is a mathematician doing this?"}, {"time": 4894, "text": "Yeah this is a mathematician that did this."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "Which I suppose is the right

have computers or drones or lidar back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for the civil engineering."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Another fascinating thing is that like you know after effectively after the the downfall of the Roman civilization people didn't build tunnels for about a thousand years."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "We go a thousand years without tunnels and then like

this way."}, {"time": 660, "text": "How do you find that line?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "How do you operate in that gray area?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "So this is why being a teacher is so hard and

it's so important to have this multi dimensional approach to maths."}, {"time": 681, "text": "We've really offered it in one way, which is here's some numbers in a method."}, {"time": 687, "text": "You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it."}, {"time": 691, "text": "And so there are some kids who like doing that and they do well."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And a lot of kids who don't like doing it and don't do well."}, {"time": 699, "text": "But when you open up maths and you give, you let kids experience it in different ways, maybe visually with numbers, with words."}, {"time": 707, "text": "What happens is kids, there are many more kids who can access it."}, {"time": 712, "text": "So those different brain wirings you're talking about, where some people are just more able to do something in a particular way."}, {"time": 720, "text": "That's why we want to, that's one of the reasons we want to open it up so that there are different ways of accessing it."},

math early and fell in love through force."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Well, good that you fell in love about the force."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Well, but something we talked about a little bit is there is such a value for excellence."}, {"time": 753, "text": "It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up the definition of success is being in a particular class is being really good at it."}, {"time": 767, "text": "And like, it's not improving."}, {"time": 769, "text": "It's like being really good."}, {"time": 770, "text": "I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example."}, {"time": 773, "text": "We're not, it's like, it's understood, you're going to star on the basketball team if you're gonna start on the basketball team if you're going to be better than the

could win a Nobel prize."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I don't even know what that entails."}, {"time": 811, "text": "But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand and it always stuck with me

great is like, struggle is good."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Right, pushes you on, yeah."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And so the other thing about the Soviet system that I'd love to hear your comments about is just the sheer like hours of math."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Like the number of courses, you're talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I think in the

going to get there."}, {"time": 964, "text": "So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge."}, {"time": 969, "text": "And it seems from what you've said that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there if you work hard is that thought that if you're not getting there, it's your fault."}, {"time":

into these mathematical patterns."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "We couldn't stop them."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So yeah, if maths was more like that, then I think having more of it would be a really good thing."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So what age are you talking about?"}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Is there, could you comment on what age is like the most important when people quit math or give up

math."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves and maths around from about fifth grade."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And then those middle school years are really

important."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "So what's the role of the teacher in this?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So one is the explanation of the subject, but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one, you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Like that energy of like."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Turns out it's really important."}, {"time": 1145,

"I finished, what can I have next?"}, {"time": 3333, "text": "And so that was where we made our website."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "But so yeah, I think online education can be great."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "They're just a talking head."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And you can actually engage people in more active ways, even in online learning."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "So I learned from the Udacity principle when I was working at Udacity, never to talk more than like five minutes."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "And then to ask people to do something."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have is a little bit of presenting something and then people do something and there's a little bit more."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Because I think if you have a half hour video, you just switch off and start doing other things."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute, like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And then there's like a quiz almost."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Then you answer a question, yeah."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "Yeah, no, that's really effective."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "You mentioned Ucubed, so what's the mission?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "You mentioned how it started, but what's yeah, where are you at now?"}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And what's your dream with it?"}, {"time": 3404, "text": "What are the kind of things that people should go and check out?"}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Yeah, we started Ucubed, I guess it was about five years ago now and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "So I'm very happy about that."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching with teachers, students, parents in maths and to help."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "We have a sort of sub goal of a raising maths anxiety."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "That's important to us, but also to share maths as this beautiful creative subject."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And it's been really great."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "We have lessons on the site, but one of the reasons I thought this was needed is there's a lot of knowledge in the academy about how to teach maths well."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "Loads and loads of research and journals and lots of things written up, but teachers don't read it."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "They don't have access to it."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "They're often behind pay walls, they've written in really inaccessible ways."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "So people wouldn't want to read them or understand them."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So this actually is a big problem."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "You have this whole industry of people finding out how to teach well, not sharing it with the people who are teaching."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "So that's why we made Ucubed."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "And instead of just putting articles up saying, here's some things to read about how to teach well, we translated what was coming from research into things that teacher could use."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "So lessons, there were videos to show kids and there were tips for parents."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "There were all sorts of things on the site."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And it's been amazing."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "As we took inspiration from the week of code, which got teachers to focus on coding for a week."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "And we have this thing called the week of inspirational maths."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And we say, just try it for a week."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "Just give us one week and try it and see what happens."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And so it's been downloaded millions of times."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Teachers use it every year."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "They start the school year with it."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And what they tell us is it was amazing."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "The kids lights were on, they were excited, they loved it."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks and the lights went out and they were not interested."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "It is, I wish, I mean, what I would love is if we could actually extend that for the whole year."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "We're a small team at Stanford and we're trying to keep up with great things to put on the site."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "We haven't the capacity to produce these creative visual maths tasks for every year group for every day, but I would love to do that."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "How difficult is it to do?"}, {"time": 3568, "text": "I mean, it's to come up with visual formulations of these big important topics you need to think about in a way that you could teach."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "I mean, we can do it."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths and we made K8 maths books with exactly that."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "Big ideas, rich activities, visuals."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "We just finished the last one."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "We've been doing it for five years and it's been exhausting and we just finished."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "So now there's a whole K8 set of books and they're organized in that way."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "These are the big ideas."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "Here are rich, deep activities."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "They're not though what you can do every day for a year."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement to their boring textbook."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And some people have said, okay, this is the year."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "This book tells us what the year is and then we'll supplement these big activities with."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "So they're being used and teachers really like them and are really happy about them."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "I just always want more."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And I guess one of the things I would like for YouCubed, one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths knows about YouCubed."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us are really happy they found it but there's a lot of other teachers who don't know that it exists."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "I hope this helps."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "From a student perspective and not in the classroom but at home studying, is there some advice you can give on how to best study mathematics?"}, {"time": 3669, "text": "So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?"}, {"time": 3673, "text": "Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people when they review material, whether it's maths or anything else, don't do it in the best way."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "I think a problem a lot of people have is they read through maybe a teacher's explanation or a way of doing maths and it makes sense."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And they think, oh yeah, I've got that."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And they move on."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "But then it's not until you come to try and work on something and do a problem that you actually realize you didn't really understand it, just seemed to make sense."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "So I would say, this is also something that neuroscientists talk about, to keep giving yourself questions is a really good way to study."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "Rather than looking through lots of material, it's always like giving yourself lots of tests is a good way to actually deeply understand things and know what you do and you don't understand."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "So would the questions be in the form of the material you're reviewing is the answer to that question?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "Or is it almost like beyond, it's the polygon thing they mentioned for a square."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "Is it almost like, I wonder what is the bigger picture?"}, {"time": 3742, "text": "I was kind of asking like, how is this extended and so on?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "Yeah, that would be great."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "And it's a similar, I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?"}, {"time": 3754, "text": "And one of the recommendations I give is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework, but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like, what was the big idea you learned today?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Or what did you find difficult?"}, {"time": 3771, "text": "What did you struggle with?"}, {"time": 3773, "text": "What was something that was exciting?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect in a deeper way."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "A lot of times, I don't know if you had this experience as a math student, lots of people do."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "Kids are going through math questions, they're successful, they get them right, but they don't even really know what they're about."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that, doing lots of questions, but that really knowing what even the topic is or what it's about, what it's important for."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "So having students go back and think at the end of a day, what was the big idea from this maths lesson?"}, {"time": 3811, "text": "Why is it important?"}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Where would I find that in real life?"}, {"time": 3816, "text": "Those are really good questions for kids to be thinking about."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "It's probably for everybody to be thinking about."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "I think most of us go through life never asking the bigger question, always those layers of why questions that kids ask when they're very young."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "We need to keep doing that."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Like whatever the term is, you call first principles thinking, some people call it that, which is like, why are we doing it this way?"}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So one nice thing is to do that because there's usually a good answer."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "The reason we did it this way is because it works for this reason."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "But then if you want to do something totally novel, you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way because of historical reasons, but really this is not the best way to do it."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "There might be other ways."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And that's how invention happens."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "And then you get, that's really useful in every aspect of life, like choosing your career, choosing your, I don't know, where you live, who your romantic partner is, like everything."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "Everything, yeah."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And I think it probably starts doing that in math class."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "That would be good if we started doing that."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that for most of my education, asking why,

problem really outside the classroom, they have to publish on it."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "It's the first time you think, wait, why are these things interesting, useful?"}, {"time": 3927, "text": "Which are the things that are useful?"}, {"time": 3929, "text": "And yeah, I guess that would be nice if we did that much earlier, the quest of invention."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data I think about is the questions kids ask in school goes down like in a linear progression from, in the early years, you can't stop kids asking those questions, but they learn not to ask the questions."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "I think you told somewhere about an early memory you had in your own education where you asked the question, or maybe that was an example you gave, but it was shut down."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "You've listened to something I said, yeah."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "I don't remember where it was, but it caught me."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "Yeah, I remember it really vividly."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Or can you tell the memory?"}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Yeah, I was, it's funny, I can remember."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "It must've really impacted me in that moment because you know how there's lots of hours of school you don't remember at all, but anyway, I can remember where I was sitting and everything."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "I was in a high school maths class, although they don't call it that in England, and the teacher said, and it was like the first class of this teacher's class, and he said, ask if you have any questions."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "So at one point I put my hand up and I said, I have a question, and he said something like, that's your question?"}, {"time": 4013, "text": "And I was like, oh, okay, I'm not asking any more questions in this class."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna, the lesson you learn from that is I'm not gonna ask."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "Yeah, that was absolutely the last question I'm asking."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "I remember that really well."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So maybe because of that experience, one of the things we encourage when we teach kids is asking questions, and we value it when they ask questions and we put them up on walls and celebrate."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "It's funny because I wish there was a feedback signal because he probably, to put a positive spin on it, he probably didn't realize the negative impact he's had in that moment, right?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "If he only knew, see, this is probably when you're more mature in grad school."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "I had an amazing professor named Ali Shakafande in computer science, and he would get, he would encourage questions, but then he would tell everybody how dumb their questions are."}, {"time": 4074,

"Yeah, it's an art, right, to do it, to write."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And then you have to time it right because that kind of humor is probably better for when you're in grad school versus when you're in the early education."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Well, and I guess kids or young people get whether somebody's doing it to be funny or, you know, I mean, this is why teaching is so hard."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "Even your tone can be impactful."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "It's so sad because for that particular human, the teacher, you just had a bad day, and one statement can have a profound negative impact."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "I know, sadly, that there's a lot of maths teachers who have that kind of approach, and I think they're suffering from the fact that they think people are math people, not math people, and that comes across in their teaching."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "But on the flip side, one positive statement."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "Keep them going."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "That is the flip side of that."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject."},

my A level maths teacher."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "So I was in England."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "You do lots of subjects till you're 16, and then you choose like three or four subjects."},

anyways, she was my teacher, and for the first time in my whole career in maths, she would give us problems and tell us to talk about them with each other."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "And so here I was sitting there at like 17, talking with friends about how to solve a math problem, and that was it."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "That was the change that she made, but it was profound for me because like those calculus students, I started to hear other people's ways of thinking and seeing it, and we would talk together and come up with solutions."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And I was like, that was it."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "That changed maths for me."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "It wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "It was more like she was the catalyst for that collaborative experience."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "I mean, sometimes it's a personal message, but it can be your teaching approach that changes maths for kids."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work, and he's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist, and he talks about the kind of the focus required to do that kind of work."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "Is there something you can comment on?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "You know, we live in a world full of distractions."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "That seems like one of the elements that makes studying, and especially the studying of subjects that require thinking like maths does, difficult."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "Is there something from a student perspective, from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work that you can comment on?"}, {"time": 4281, "text": "Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems, and we have some on our website, is a really important experience for them."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "Even if they only do it occasionally, but it's really important."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "They actually realise, I do, I give a problem out often when I'm working with teachers, and I say to them, all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "And they're like, an hour?"}, {"time": 4311, "text": "They think it's shocking."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "And then they work on this problem, and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?"}, {"time": 4317, "text": "They're like, an hour's gone by?"}, {"time": 4320, "text": "How is this possible?"}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And so everybody needs those like rich deep problems."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Most kids go through their whole maths experience of however many years, never once working on a problem in that kind of deep way."}, {"time": 4336, "text": "So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "We work on these deep problems every session."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "And the students come away going, okay, I never wanna go back to that maths relationship I had where it was just all about quick answers."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "I just don't wanna go back to that."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate those problems in their classrooms."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Maybe they don't do them every day, but they at least give kids some experience of being able to work slowly and deeply and to go to deeper places and not be told they've got five minutes to finish 20 questions."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Well, part of it is also just the exercise of sitting there and maintaining focus for prolonged periods of time."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "That's not often, I mean, that's a skill."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "It's a skill that also could be discouraging."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Like if you don't practice it, just sitting down for 10 minutes straight and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "Like if you're really thinking about a problem and I think it's really important to realize that that's a skill that you can just like a muscle, you can build, you can start with five minutes and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "And to be successful, I think in certain subjects like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "Otherwise you're not going to get to the really rewarding experience of solving these problems."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "There was a survey done of kids in school where they were asked, how long will you work on a maths problem before you give up and decide it's not possible to solve it?"}, {"time": 4442, "text": "And the result on average across the kids was two minutes."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Yeah, that's a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign that they need to learn to not give up so quickly."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "Yeah, we mentioned offline because we've been talking so much about visualization, Grant Sanderson, Three Blue One Brown."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So he's inspired millions of people with exactly the kind of way of thinking that you've been talking about."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "Yeah, I love his work."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Converting sort of mathematical concepts into visual, like visually representing them, exploring them in ways that help you illuminate like the concepts."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "What do you think is the role of that?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "So he uses mostly programmatic visualization."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations created by writing computer programs."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "Like what do you think, how scalable is that approach?"}, {"time": 4508, "text": "But in general, what do you think about his approach?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "I think it's amazing."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "I should work with him."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "I can share some of our visuals and he can make them in that amazing way."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "So part of his storytelling, part of it is creating the visuals and then weaving a story with those visuals that kind of builds, like there's also, I mean, there's also drama in it."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "You start with a small example and then you kind of, all of a sudden there's a surprise."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love with the concept."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "He does talk about that."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "His sense is like some of the stuff, he doesn't feel like he's teaching like the core curriculum, which is something, he sees himself as an inspirational figure."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "But because I think it's too difficult to kind of convert all of the curriculum into those elements."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "And probably you don't need to."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas in the way that he shares them, that will change them."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "And it will change the way they think."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "And maybe they could go on to take some other mathematical idea and make it that beautiful."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "Well, he does that."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "He created a library called Manim and he open sourced it."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "And that library is the, people should check it out."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "It's written in Python and it uses some of those same elements."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "Like it allows you to animate equations and animate little shapes."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "Like people that, you know, he has a very distinct style in his videos and what that resulted in, even though from a software engineer perspective, the code he released is not like super well documented or perfect, but him releasing that, now there's all of these people educating it."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And the cool, to me personally, the coolest thing is to see like people they're not, you know, don't have like a million subscribers or something is they have just a few views in the video, but it just seems like the process of them creating a video where they teach is like transformative to them from a student perspective."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "It's the old Feynman thing, the best way to learn is to teach."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "And then him releasing that into the wild is, it shows that that impact."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "I think just giving people that idea that you can do that with maths and other subjects, there's bound to be people all around who can create more, which is cool."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "So I recommend that people do like JavaScript or Python."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "You can build like visualizations of most concepts in high school math."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "You can do a lot of kinds of visualizations and doing that yourself."}, {"time": 4681,

something in us that loves patterns, loves figuring out difficult things and the patterns in there then are unexpected in some way."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "Have you ever noticed that hotels are

an infant in a neighboring group."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And this was the start of my interest because it was such chilling evidence of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Now, at that time, we didn't know very much about how chimpanzees and humans were related."},

hunting meat."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "She had seen that they were sharing the meat among each other."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "She had seen that the societies were dominated politically by males, coalitions of males."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "All of these things, of course, resonate so closely with humans."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And then it turns out that in contrast to conventional wisdom at the time, the chimpanzees were capable of hunting and killing members of neighboring groups."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Well, at that point, the similarities between chimps and humans become less a matter of sort of sheer intellectual fascination than something that has a really deep meaning about our understanding of ourselves."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans as a species apart from the rest of nature because we are so peculiar."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "But when it turns out that, as it turns out, one of our two closest

fan of these topics."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration of violence and the relations between chimps so interesting?"}, {"time": 1460, "text": "What can they teach us about ourselves?"}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Until we had this information about chimpanzees, it was possible to believe that the psychology behind warfare was totally the result of some kind of recent cultural innovation."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "It had nothing to do with our biology."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Or if you like, that it's got something to do with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully about it is that it seems undoubtedly the case that our evolutionary psychology has given us the same kind of attitude towards violence as has occurred in chimpanzees and in both species."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "It has evolved because of its evolutionary significance."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "In other words, because it's been helpful to the individuals who have practiced it."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "And now we know that, as I mentioned, other species do this as well."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind of ironical observation, Conrad Lorentz, who I mentioned had been the person who thought that human aggression in the form of killing members of our own species was unique to our species, he was a great fan of wolves."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "He studied wolves."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely to harm each other in spats among members of the same group."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "What happens is that one of them will roll over and present their neck, much as you see in a dog park nowadays, and the other might put their jaws on the neck but will not bite."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting for each other, they are in fierce competition, and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "So it's a really serious business."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern of understanding animals in which you don't have an instinct for violence, what you have is an instinct, if you like, to use violence adaptively."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive, if the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent than others because of things like the frequency with which a large party of males is likely to meet a lone victim, and that's going to depend on the local ecology."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "But, you know, so the overall answer to the question of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take very seriously the notion that in humans, the tendency to make war is a consequence of a long term evolutionary adaptation and not just a military ideology or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And of course, you know, a reading of history, a judicious reading of history fits that very easily because war is so commonplace."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "It's not an accident, so it's not a constraint."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "It's not an accident, so it's not a construction of human civilization."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "It's deeply within us, violence."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So what's the difference between violence on the individual level versus group is, it seems like with chimps and with wolves, there's something about the dynamic of multiple chimps together that increase the chance of violence."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?"}, {"time": 1721, "text": "Like would an individual be as violent as they might be as part of a group?"}, {"time": 1727, "text": "If we're talking about killing, then violence in the sense of killing is very much associated with a group."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And the reason is that individuals don't benefit by getting into a fight in which they risk being hurt themselves."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So it's only when you have overwhelming power that the temptation to try and kill another victim rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it."}, {"time": 1763, "text":

one."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one, but that's getting risky."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "But if you have eight, you can see what can happen."}, {"time":

immobilized victim with four individuals capable of just doing the damage."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax and tear off his testicles and twist an arm until it breaks and do this appalling damage with no weapons."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?"}, {"time": 1823, "text": "Is there something to be said about the actual process of it?"}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Is there an artistry to it?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "So if you look at human warfare, there's different parts in history prefer different kind of approaches to violence."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "But just the nature of violence itself, sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence, is it basically the same?"}, {"time": 1849, "text": "You improvise, you immobilize the victim, and they just rip off different parts of their body kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1856, "text": "Yeah, you have to understand that these things are happening at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly, so that they have not been filmed carefully."}, {"time": 1868,

hard for me to imagine that there are styles that vary between communities, cultural styles, but it is possible."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It is possible, and one thing that is striking is that the number of times that an individual victim has been killed immediately has been higher in Kibale forest in Uganda than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "It's conceivable that's just chance."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?"}, {"time": 1914, "text": "I can't remember the exact numbers, but 10 versus 15 or something."},

differences in the numbers of attackers."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "You know, human beings are able to conceive of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Is there any of that for chimps when they're thinking about violence?"}, {"time": 1950, "text": "Is violence, like what is the nature of their conception of violence, do you think?"}, {"time": 1956, "text":

sex."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "So when males are interested in having sex with a female, whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans, they don't think about the fact that what this is going to do is to lead to a baby, mostly."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "Mostly what they're thinking about is, I wanna get my end away."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "And I think that it's a similar kind of process with the

aggression."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And that suggests that what's happening with Homo sapiens is that that is the point at which there is selection against the alpha males."}, {"time": 2795,

support males and take advantage of the fact that they have political power at the expense of females."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "And I would say that that all goes back to what happened three to

awkward because it includes some unpleasant features that when we sit back and reflect about them, we would like them to go away."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "But it remains the fact that men are hugely

{"time": 6501, "text": "Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "And there are various signals in the food such as the amount of sugar there, the amount of free amino acids because the amino acids can be tasted."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "And the physical qualities of the food be particularly important, how tough the food is."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "Always prefer softer food, provided it feels safe, tastes safe."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "And these kinds of sensory cues are all there in

it spontaneously."}, {"time": 6551, "text": "Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food."}, {"time": 6554, "text": "Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence of domestication, but even, as I say, all of the great apes, you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked if they can."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "So then obvious, once you have fire, you're going to accidentally discover that food changes when you apply fire to it and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "You took the words out of my mouth."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "I mean, if they have fire at all and their food rolls into it, five minutes later it tastes better than it did before."}, {"time": 6586, "text": "How big of an invention from an engineering perspective do you think is the

fire has been ultimately responsible for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here, the entire human story, going back to homo."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "It is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "So the story here is that the constraints on brain size are energetic."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "You and I have brains that are something like 2.5% of our body weight."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "It consumes around 25% of all of our calories."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "So it's disproportionate."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "There are other expensive organs in our body as well, such as the heart."},

brain, whereas we don't want an even bigger heart."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "So what those reasons are is unclear."}, {"time": 6691, "text": "But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain, cooking makes it possible because it's supplying more calories and it is enormously reducing the amount of time that it takes to chew your food."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "So if you were a gorilla and you wanted to have a bigger brain, you might say, okay, well, let's just eat some more."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day in the sense that they are eating for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "That's just chewing."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And then they've got to sit around and digest their food because they can't just eat all the time."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "They've got to take a break while the food is digested in the stomach and then passed into the gut."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So the stomach is already full."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "So basically gorillas are eating about the maximum rate already."}, {"time": 6751, "text": "So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?"}, {"time": 6753, "text": "It doesn't, it's actually got a smaller brain relative to its body size than a chimpanzee does."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "And that's the basic problem for our ancestors."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "Then you come along and cook and all of a sudden you can get an increased amount of energy from your food."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "You are spending much less energy on digesting your food."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "You know, there are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food, making the acid that takes the proteins apart, maintaining the brush border where the molecules are taken across the gut wall and so on."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "That all costs."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "It costs you to digest your food."}, {"time": 6797, "text": "It costs less if you cook your food."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "So you get a net gain in the amount of energy and you are reducing the amount of time from in our case, our ancestors, probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things and to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain and famously, throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo, you have a steadily increasing size of brain until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "Which end is this?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?"}, {"time": 6846, "text": "Yeah, with Homo sapiens, you've got a smaller brain from, people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining."}, {"time": 6857, "text": "And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains than their wild ancestors."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "And I."}, {"time": 6870, "text": "The domestication is intricately connected to this brain size, you think?"}, {"time": 6874, "text": "And exactly, so I think what we're seeing in humans is that same manifestation."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "And then the fascinating question is why?"}, {"time": 6883, "text": "And the only point I would want to make about this is that there's no evidence that in the small brain domesticates, they're losing say an average about 15% of brain size."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "In the small brain domesticates compared to their wild ancestors, there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "It's a more pedomorphic brain, looking like the juveniles of the ancestor."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "But just as our kids are very smart and can learn amazing things compared to adults, all they lack is wisdom and maturity, but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "And I think that's the same with domesticated animals compared to their wild ancestors, and probably therefore with Homo sapiens, say 30,000 years ago,

connection between fire, cooking, and the eating of meat?"}, {"time": 6950, "text": "Which came first, do you think?"}, {"time": 6953, "text": "Humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?"}, {"time": 6961, "text": "I think that fire increased the using of meat."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "But the fact that chimpanzees really like to

Australopithecine line."}, {"time": 6984, "text": "It's very likely therefore Australopithecines were eating meat when they could get it, which wouldn't be very often because they wouldn't be very good sprinters."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "But nevertheless, they would occasionally be able to get some meat, and I bet they loved it all the time, and basically all primates like meat if they can get it, almost all of them."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "But I think fire would have been very important for a couple of reasons."}, {"time": 7007, "text": "One is that once you eat your food cooked, then you're saving yourself time."}, {"time": 7015, "text": "By saving yourself time, you can free up the opportunity to go and hunt more."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "Because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "There's every risk that you will get nothing on one particular afternoon that you go off looking for opportunities to kill."}, {"time": 7036, "text":

saving from not having to chew their food?"}, {"time": 7052, "text": "I think that in the case of males, it's very reasonable to think they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month, and the average hunt length is 20 minutes."}, {"time": 7067, "text": "With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month, and the average hunt length is six hours."}, {"time": 7077, "text": "So, and that's possible because the time was available, because they were cooking."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "Less chewing, more hunting."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "You got it."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey, and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "They're so excited about going into the hunt, and when they make the kill, then there's screams everywhere, and some don't like to seize it and capture it and take it away from the others, and eventually the strongest one has it, and the others sit around begging and trying to get some and tear it off, and so they all love it."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "I mean, they love it, but it takes them a lot of time to chew it."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies, and there sometimes comes a time when they just say, I've had enough of this, I need real food, and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again because they can get fruit into their bodies so much faster than they can get meat."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "So once they're cooking, that problem is solved, and they can eat the meat much more readily."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "So I think that meat eating would become important for two reasons with cooking."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "So the key, not to oversimplify, but the key moments in human history are with Homo erectus, the discovery of fire and the use of fire for cooking, and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males killing off the alpha males so that the cooperation can exist, and cooperation leads to communication and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that is that you have to ask, how is it that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?"}, {"time": 7221, "text": "And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males within their own group sometimes, it's not a process of killing the alpha male."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "It's taking advantage of opportunity when some male gets into a bad position, but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "And you can see why, because they don't have language, and without language, it's very difficult to know how confident you can be of the support of

reinforcement setting."}, {"time": 324, "text": "And this is going to my analogy of the cake."}, {"time": 330, "text": "The cake as someone has called it, where when you try to figure out how much information you ask the machine to predict and how much feedback you give the machine at every trial, in reinforcement learning, you give the machine a single scalar."}, {"time": 343, "text": "You tell the machine you did good, you did bad."}, {"time": 345, "text": "And you only tell this to the machine once in a while."}, {"time": 349, "text": "When I say you, it could be the universe telling the machine, right?"}, {"time": 354, "text": "But it's just one scalar."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And so as a consequence, you cannot possibly learn something very complicated without many, many, many trials where you get many, many feedbacks of this type."}, {"time": 364, "text": "Supervised learning, you give a few bits to the machine at every sample."}, {"time": 371, "text": "Let's say you're training a system on recognizing images on ImageNet with 1000 categories, that's a little less than 10 bits of information per sample."}, {"time": 382, "text": "But self supervised learning, here is the setting."}, {"time": 384, "text": "Ideally, we don't know how to do this yet, but ideally you would show a machine a segment of video and then stop the video and ask the machine to predict what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 397, "text": "And so we let the machine predict and then you let time go by and show the machine what actually happened and hope the machine will learn to do a better job at predicting next time around."}, {"time": 409, "text": "There's a huge amount of information you give the machine because it's an entire video clip of the future after the video clip you fed it in the first place."}, {"time": 420, "text": "So both for language and for vision, there's a subtle, seemingly trivial construction, but maybe that's representative of what is required to create intelligence, which is filling the gap."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So it sounds dumb, but can you, it is possible you could solve all of intelligence in this way, just for both language, just give a sentence and continue it or give a sentence and there's a gap in it, some words blanked out and you fill in what words go there."}, {"time": 455, "text": "For vision, you give a sequence of images and predict what's going to happen next, or you fill in what happened in between."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Do you think it's possible that formulation alone as a signal for self supervised learning can solve intelligence for vision and language?"}, {"time": 473, "text": "I think that's the best shot at the moment."}, {"time": 476, "text": "So whether this will take us all the way to human level intelligence or something, or just cat level intelligence is not clear, but among all the possible approaches that people have proposed, I think it's our best shot."}, {"time": 489, "text": "So I think this idea of an intelligent system filling in the blanks, either predicting the future, inferring the past, filling in missing information, I'm currently filling the blank of what is behind your head and what your head looks like from the back, because I have basic knowledge about how humans are made."}, {"time": 513, "text": "And I don't know what you're going to say, at which point you're going to speak, whether you're going to move your head this way or that way, which way you're going to look, but I know you're not going to just dematerialize and reappear three meters down the hall, because I know what's possible and what's impossible according to intuitive physics."}, {"time": 531, "text": "You have a model of what's possible and what's impossible and then you'd be very surprised if it happens and then you'll have to reconstruct your model."}, {"time": 537, "text": "Right, so that's the model of the world."}, {"time": 539, "text": "It's what tells you, what fills in the blanks."}, {"time": 542, "text": "So given your partial information about the state of the world, given by your perception, your model of the world fills in the missing information and that includes predicting the future, re predicting the past, filling in things you don't immediately perceive."}, {"time": 558, "text": "And that doesn't have to be purely generic vision or visual information or generic language."}, {"time": 564, "text": "You can go to specifics like predicting what control decision you make when you're driving in a lane, you have a sequence of images from a vehicle and then you have information if you record it on video where the car ended up going so you can go back in time and predict where the car went based on the visual information."}, {"time": 586, "text": "That's very specific, domain specific."}, {"time": 589, "text": "Right, but the question is whether we can come up with sort of a generic method for training machines to do this kind of prediction or filling in the blanks."}, {"time": 599, "text": "So right now, this type of approach has been unbelievably successful in the context of natural language processing."}, {"time": 608, "text": "Every modern natural language processing is pre trained in self supervised manner to fill in the blanks."}, {"time": 613, "text": "You show it a sequence of words, you remove 10% of them and then you train some gigantic neural net to predict the words that are missing."}, {"time": 620, "text": "And once you've pre trained that network, you can use the internal representation learned by it as input to something that you train supervised or whatever."}, {"time": 632, "text": "That's been incredibly successful."}, {"time": 633, "text": "Not so successful in images, although it's making progress and it's based on sort of manual data augmentation."}, {"time": 642, "text": "We can go into this later, but what has not been successful yet is training from video."}, {"time": 647, "text":

well, let's kind of give a high level overview."}, {"time": 657, "text": "What's the difference in kind and in difficulty between vision and language?"}, {"time": 663, "text": "So you said people haven't been able to really kind of crack the problem of vision open in terms of self supervised learning, but that may not be necessarily because it's fundamentally more difficult."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Maybe like when we're talking about achieving, like passing the Turing test in the full spirit of the Turing test in language might be harder than vision."}, {"time": 686, "text": "So in your view, which is harder or perhaps are they just the same problem?"}, {"time": 691, "text": "When the farther we get to solving each, the more we realize it's all the same thing."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's all the same cake."}, {"time": 697, "text": "I think what I'm looking for are methods that make them look essentially like the same cake, but currently they're not."}, {"time": 704, "text": "And the main issue with learning world models or learning predictive models is that the prediction is never a single thing because the world is not entirely predictable."}, {"time": 719, "text": "It may be deterministic or stochastic."}, {"time": 720, "text": "We can get into the philosophical discussion about it, but even if it's deterministic, it's not entirely predictable."}, {"time": 727, "text": "And so if I play a short video clip and then I ask you to predict what's going to happen next, there's many, many plausible continuations for that video clip and the number of continuation grows with the interval of time that you're asking the system to make a prediction for."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And so one big question with self supervised learning is how you represent this uncertainty, how you represent multiple discrete outcomes, how you represent a sort of continuum of possible outcomes, et cetera."}, {"time": 760, "text": "And if you are sort of a classical machine learning person, you say, oh, you just represent a distribution, right?"}, {"time": 769, "text": "And that we know how to do when we're predicting words, missing words in the text, because you can have a neural net give a score for every word in the dictionary."}, {"time": 778, "text": "It's a big list of numbers, maybe 100,000 or so."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And you can turn them into a probability distribution that tells you when I say a sentence, the cat is chasing the blank in the kitchen."}, {"time": 793, "text": "There are only a few words that make sense there."}, {"time": 795, "text": "It could be a mouse or it could be a lizard spot or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "And if I say the blank is chasing the blank in the Savannah, you also have a bunch of plausible options for those two words, right?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Because you have kind of a underlying reality that you can refer to to sort of fill in those blanks."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So you cannot say for sure in the Savannah, if it's a lion or a cheetah or whatever, you cannot know if it's a zebra or a do or whatever, wildebeest, the same thing."}, {"time": 835, "text": "But you can represent the uncertainty by just a long list of numbers."}, {"time": 838, "text": "Now, if I do the same thing with video, when I ask you to predict a video clip, it's not a discrete set of potential frames."}, {"time": 847, "text": "You have to have somewhere representing a sort of infinite number of plausible continuations of multiple frames in a high dimensional continuous space."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And we just have no idea how to do this properly."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Fine night, high dimensional."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So like you, It's finite high dimensional, yes."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Just like the words, they try to get it down to a small finite set of like under a million, something like that."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I mean, it's kind of ridiculous that we're doing a distribution over every single possible word for language and it works."}, {"time": 882, "text": "It feels like that's a really dumb way to do it."}, {"time": 886, "text": "Like there seems to be like there should be some more compressed representation of the distribution of the words."}, {"time": 895, "text": "You're right about that."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And so do you have any interesting ideas about how to represent all of reality in a compressed way such that you can form a distribution over it?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "That's one of the big questions, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Right, I mean, what's kind of another thing that really is stupid about, I shouldn't say stupid, but like simplistic about current approaches to self supervised learning in NLP in text is that not only do you represent a giant distribution over words, but for multiple words that are missing, those distributions are essentially independent of each other."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And you don't pay too much of a price for this."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So you can't, so the system in the sentence that I gave earlier, if it gives a certain probability for a lion and cheetah, and then a certain probability for gazelle, wildebeest and zebra, those two probabilities are independent of each other."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And it's not the case that those things are independent."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Lions actually attack like bigger animals than cheetahs."}, {"time": 961, "text": "So there's a huge independent hypothesis in this process, which is not actually true."}, {"time": 967, "text": "The reason for this is that we don't know how to represent properly distributions over combinatorial sequences of symbols, essentially because the number grows exponentially with the length of the symbols."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And so we have to use tricks for this, but those techniques can get around, like don't even deal with it."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So the big question is would there be some sort of abstract latent representation of text that would say that when I switch lion for gazelle, lion for cheetah, I also have to switch zebra for gazelle?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Yeah, so this independence assumption, let me throw some criticism at you that I often hear and see how you respond."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So this kind of filling in the blanks is just statistics."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "You're not learning anything like the deep underlying concepts."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "You're just mimicking stuff from the past."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You're not learning anything new such that you can use it to generalize about the world."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Or okay, let me just say the crude version, which is just statistics."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's not intelligence."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "What do you have to say to that?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "What do you usually say to that if you kind of hear this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "I don't get into those discussions because they are kind of pointless."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So first of all, it's quite possible that intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It's just statistics of a particular kind."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Yes, this is the philosophical question."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "It's kind of is it possible that intelligence is just statistics?"}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Yeah, but what kind of statistics?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So if you are asking the question, are the models of the world that we learn, do they have some notion of causality?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So if the criticism comes from people who say, current machine learning system don't care about causality, which by the way is wrong, I agree with them."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Your model of the world should have your actions as one of the inputs."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "And that will drive you to learn causal models of the world where you know what intervention in the world will cause what result."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Or you can do this by observation of other agents acting in the world and observing the effect."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Other humans, for example."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So I think at some level of description, intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "But that doesn't mean you don't have models that have deep mechanistic explanation for what goes on."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The question is how do you learn them?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "That's the question I'm interested in."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Because a lot of people who actually voice their criticism say that those mechanistic model have to come from someplace else."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "They have to come from human designers, they have to come from I don't know what."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And obviously we learn them."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Or if we don't learn them as an individual, nature learn them for us using evolution."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So regardless of what you think, those processes have been learned somehow."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So if you look at the human brain, just like when we humans introspect about how the brain works, it seems like when we think about what is intelligence, we think about the high level stuff, like the models we've constructed, concepts like cognitive science, like concepts of memory and reasoning module, almost like these high level modules."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Is this serve as a good analogy?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like are we ignoring the dark matter, the basic low level mechanisms?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Just like we ignore the way the operating system works, we're just using the high level software."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "We're ignoring that at the low level, the neural network might be doing something like statistics."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Like meaning, sorry to use this word probably incorrectly and crudely, but doing this kind of fill in the gap kind of learning and just kind of updating the model constantly in order to be able to support the raw sensory information to predict it and then adjust to the prediction when it's wrong."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "But like when we look at our brain at the high level, it feels like we're doing, like we're playing chess, like we're like playing with high level concepts and we're stitching them together and we're putting them into longterm memory."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "But really what's going underneath is something we're not able to introspect, which is this kind of simple, large neural network that's just filling in the gaps."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Right, well, okay."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So there's a lot of questions and a lot of answers there."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Okay, so first of all, there's a whole school of thought in neuroscience, computational neuroscience in particular, that likes the idea of predictive coding, which is really related to the idea I was talking about in self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So everything is about prediction."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "The essence of intelligence is the ability to predict and everything the brain does is trying to predict, predict everything from everything else."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Okay, and that's really sort of the underlying principle, if you want, that self supervised learning is trying to kind of reproduce this idea of prediction as kind of an essential mechanism of task independent learning, if you want."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "The next step is what kind of intelligence are you interested in reproducing?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And of course, we all think about trying to reproduce sort of high level cognitive processes in humans, but like with machines, we're not even at the level of even reproducing the learning processes in a cat brain."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "The most intelligent or intelligent systems don't have as much common sense as a house cat."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So how is it that cats learn?"}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And cats don't do a whole lot of reasoning."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "They certainly have causal models."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "They certainly have, because many cats can figure out how they can act on the world to get what they want."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "They certainly have a fantastic model of intuitive physics, certainly the dynamics of their own bodies, but also of praise and things like that."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So they're pretty smart."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "They only do this with about 800 million neurons."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "We are not anywhere close to reproducing this kind of thing."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So to some extent, I could say, let's not even worry about like the high level cognition and kind of longterm planning and reasoning that humans can do until we figure out like, can we even reproduce what cats are doing?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Now that said, this ability to learn world models, I think is the key to the possibility of learning machines that can also reason."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "So whenever I give a talk, I say there are three challenges in the three main challenges in machine learning."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "The first one is getting machines to learn to represent the world and I'm proposing self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "The second is getting machines to reason in ways that are compatible with essentially gradient based learning because this is what deep learning is all about really."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And the third one is something we have no idea how to solve, at least I have no idea how to solve is can we get machines to learn hierarchical representations of action plans?"}, {"time": 1397, "text": "We know how to train them to learn hierarchical representations of perception with convolutional nets and things like that and transformers, but what about action plans?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Can we get them to spontaneously learn good hierarchical representations of actions?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Also gradient based."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Yeah, all of that needs to be somewhat differentiable so that you can apply sort of gradient based learning, which is really what deep learning is about."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So it's background, knowledge, ability to reason in a way that's differentiable that is somehow connected, deeply integrated with that background knowledge or builds on top of that background knowledge and then given that background knowledge be able to make hierarchical plans in the world."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So if you take classical optimal control, there's something in classical optimal control called model predictive control."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And it's been around since the early sixties."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "NASA uses that to compute trajectories of rockets."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And the basic idea is that you have a predictive model of the rocket, let's say, or whatever system you intend to control, which given the state of the system at time T and given an action that you're taking the system."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So for a rocket to be thrust and all the controls you can have, it gives you the state of the system at time T plus Delta T, right?"}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So basically a differential equation, something like that."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "And if you have this model and you have this model in the form of some sort of neural net or some sort of a set of formula that you can back propagate gradient through, you can do what's called model predictive control or gradient based model predictive control."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So you can unroll that model in time."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "You feed it a hypothesized sequence of actions."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And then you have some objective function that measures how well at the end of the trajectory, the system has succeeded or matched what you wanted to do."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Is it a robot harm?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Have you grasped the object you want to grasp?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "If it's a rocket, are you at the right place near the space station, things like that."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And by back propagation through time, and again, this was invented in the 1960s, by optimal control theorists, you can figure out what is the optimal sequence of actions that will get my system to the best final state."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's basically planning."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And a lot of planning systems in robotics are actually based on this."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And you can think of this as a form of reasoning."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So to take the example of the teenager driving a car, you have a pretty good dynamical model of the car."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "It doesn't need to be very accurate."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "But you know, again, that if you turn the wheel to the right and there is a cliff, you're gonna run off the cliff, right?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "You don't need to have a very accurate model to predict that."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And you can run this in your mind and decide not to do it for that reason."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Because you can predict in advance that the result is gonna be bad."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So you can sort of imagine different scenarios and then employ or take the first step in the scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process again."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "The scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process of planning."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "That's called receding horizon model predictive control."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So even all those things have names going back decades."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And so if you're not a classical optimal control, the model of the world is not generally learned."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Sometimes a few parameters you have to identify."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "That's called systems identification."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But generally, the model is mostly deterministic and mostly built by hand."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So the question of AI, I think the big challenge of AI for the next decade is how do we get machines to learn predictive models of the world that deal with uncertainty and deal with the real world in all this complexity?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So it's not just the trajectory of a rocket, which you can reduce to first principles."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's not even just the trajectory of a robot arm, which again, you can model by careful mathematics."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "But it's everything else, everything we observe in the world."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "People, behavior, physical systems that involve collective phenomena, like water or trees and branches in a tree or something or complex things that humans have no trouble developing abstract representations and predictive model for, but we still don't know how to do with machines."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Where do you put in these three, maybe in the planning stages, the game theoretic nature of this world, where your actions not only respond to the dynamic nature of the world, the environment, but also

defines a car door, this big philosophical question."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "But to me, it was interesting because it's obvious that the person opening the car doors, they're trying to get out,

right before AlphaGo that the best Go players thought there were maybe two or three stones behind an ideal player that they would call God."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "In fact, no, there are like nine or 10 stones behind."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I mean, we're just bad."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So we're not good at, and it's because we have limited working memory."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We're not very good at doing this tree exploration that computers are much better at doing than we are."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "But we are much better at learning differentiable models to the world."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "I mean, I said differentiable in a kind of, I should say not differentiable in the sense that we went back far through it, but in the sense that our brain has some mechanism for estimating gradients of some kind."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And that's what makes us efficient."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So if you have an agent that consists of a model of the world, which in the human brain is basically the entire front half of your brain, an objective function, which in humans is a combination of two things."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "There is your sort of intrinsic motivation module, which is in the basal ganglia, the base of your brain."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "That's the thing that measures pain and hunger and things like that, like immediate feelings and emotions."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And then there is the equivalent of what people in reinforcement learning call a critic, which is a sort of module that predicts ahead what the outcome of a situation will be."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And so it's not a cost function, but it's sort of not an objective function, but it's sort of a train predictor of the ultimate objective function."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And that also is differentiable."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And so if all of this is differentiable, your cost function, your critic, your world model, then you can use gradient based type methods to do planning, to do reasoning, to do learning, to do all the things that we'd like an intelligent agent to do."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "And gradient based learning, like what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 1935, "text": "That's probably at the core of what can solve intelligence."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So you don't need like logic based reasoning in your view."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I don't know how to make logic based reasoning compatible with efficient learning."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Okay, I mean, there is a big question, perhaps a philosophical question."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "I mean, it's not that philosophical, but that we can ask is that all the learning algorithms we know from engineering and computer science proceed by optimizing some objective function."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So one question we may ask is, does learning in the brain minimize an objective function?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "I mean, it could be a composite of multiple objective functions, but it's still an objective function."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Second, if it does optimize an objective function, does it do it by some sort of gradient estimation?"}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It doesn't need to be a back prop, but some way of estimating the gradient in efficient manner whose complexity is on the same order of magnitude as actually running the inference."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Because you can't afford to do things like perturbing a weight in your brain to figure out what the effect is."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And then sort of, you can do sort of estimating gradient by perturbation."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "To me, it seems very implausible that the brain uses some sort of zeroth order black box gradient free optimization, because it's so much less efficient than gradient optimization."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "So it has to have a way of estimating gradient."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "Is it possible that some kind of logic based reasoning emerges in pockets as a useful, like you said, if the brain is an objective function, maybe it's a mechanism for creating objective functions."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "It's a mechanism for creating knowledge bases, for example, that can then be queried."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Like maybe it's like an efficient representation of knowledge that's learned in a gradient based way or something like that."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "Well, so I think there is a lot of different types of intelligence."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "So first of all, I think the type of logical reasoning that we think about that we are maybe stemming from sort of classical AI of the 1970s and 80s."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I think humans use that relatively rarely and are not particularly good at it."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "But we judge each other based on our ability to solve those rare problems."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "It's called an IQ test."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "Like I'm not very good at chess."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "Yes, I'm judging you this whole time."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Because, well, we actually."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "With your heritage, I'm sure you're good at chess."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "No, stereotypes."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "Not all stereotypes are true."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Well, I'm terrible at chess."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So, but I think perhaps another type of intelligence that I have is this ability of sort of building models to the world from reasoning obviously, but also data."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And those models generally are more kind of analogical."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So it's reasoning by simulation, and by analogy, where you use one model to apply to a new situation."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "Even though you've never seen that situation, you can sort of connect it to a situation you've encountered before."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And your reasoning is more akin to some sort of internal simulation."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So you're kind of simulating what's happening when you're building, I don't know, a box out of wood or something, right?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "You can imagine in advance what would be the result of cutting the wood in this particular way."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Are you going to use screws or nails or whatever?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "When you are interacting with someone, you also have a model of that person and sort of interact with that person, having this model in mind to kind of tell the person what you think is useful to them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So I think this ability to construct models to the world is basically the essence, the essence of intelligence."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And the ability to use it then to plan actions that will fulfill a particular criterion, of course, is necessary as well."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "So I'm going to ask you a series of impossible questions as we keep asking, as I've been doing."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "So if that's the fundamental sort of dark matter of intelligence, this ability to form a background model, what's your intuition about how much knowledge is required?"}, {"time": 2201, "text": "You know, I think dark matter, you could put a percentage on it of the composition of the universe and how much of it is dark matter, how much of it is dark energy, how much information do you think is required to be a house cat?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "So you have to be able to, when you see a box going in, when you see a human compute the most evil action, if there's a thing that's near an edge, you knock it off, all of that, plus the extra stuff you mentioned, which is a great self awareness of the physics of your own body and the world."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "How much knowledge is required, do you think, to solve it?"}, {"time": 2242, "text": "I don't even know how to measure an answer to that question."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "I'm not sure how to measure it, but whatever it is, it fits in about 800,000 neurons, 800 million neurons."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "What's the representation does?"}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Everything, all knowledge, everything, right?"}, {"time": 2260, "text": "You know, it's less than a billion."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "A dog is 2 billion, but a cat is less than 1 billion."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "And so multiply that by a thousand and you get the number of synapses."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And I think almost all of it is learned through this, you know, a sort of self supervised running, although, you know, I think a tiny sliver is learned through reinforcement running and certainly very little through, you know, classical supervised running, although it's not even clear how supervised running actually works in the biological world."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So I think almost all of it is self supervised running, but it's driven by the sort of ingrained objective functions that a cat or a human have at the base of their brain, which kind of drives their behavior."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So, you know, nature tells us you're hungry."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "It doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "That's something that the rest of our brain has to figure out, right?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "What's interesting is there might be more like deeper objective functions than allowing the whole thing."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So hunger may be some kind of, now you go to like neurobiology, it might be just the brain trying to maintain homeostasis."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "So hunger is just one of the human perceivable symptoms of the brain being unhappy with the way things are currently."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "It could be just like one really dumb objective function at the core."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "But that's how behavior is driven."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "The fact that, you know, or basal ganglia drive us to do things that are different from say an orangutan or certainly a cat is what makes, you know, human nature versus orangutan nature versus cat nature."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So for example, you know, our basal ganglia drives us to seek the company of other humans."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And that's because nature has figured out that we need to be social animals for our species to survive."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And it's true of many primates."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "It's not true of orangutans."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "Orangutans are solitary animals."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "They don't seek the company of others."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "In fact, they avoid them."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "In fact, they scream at them when they come too close because they're territorial."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "Because for their survival, you know, evolution has figured out that's the best thing."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "I mean, they're occasionally social, of course, for, you know, reproduction and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "But they're mostly solitary."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "So all of those behaviors are not part of intelligence."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "You know, people say, oh, you're never gonna have intelligent machines because, you know, human intelligence is social."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "But then you look at orangutans, you look at octopus."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Octopus never know their parents."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "They barely interact with any other."},

years, they're dead."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "So there are things that we think, as humans, are intimately linked with intelligence, like social interaction, like language."}, {"time": 2439, "text":

want to walk."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "That's not, there's gotta be a deeper need for walking."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "I think it was probably socially imposed by society that you need to walk

the idea of artificially increasing the size of your training set by distorting the images that you have in ways that don't change the nature of the image, right?"}, {"time": 2792, "text": "So you do MNIST, you can do data augmentation on MNIST and people have done this since the 1990s, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "You take a MNIST digit and you shift it a little bit or you change the size or

representation, a vector in such a way that the representation for those two images are as close to each other as possible, as identical to each other as possible, right?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Because you want the system to basically learn a function that will be invariant, that will not change, whose output will not change when you transform those inputs in those particular ways, right?"}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So that's easy to do."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "What's complicated is how do you make sure that when you show two images that are different, the system will produce different things?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Because if you don't have a specific provision for this, the system will just ignore the inputs when you train it, it will end up ignoring the input and

copies, and then you push the two output vectors away from each other and it will eventually guarantee that things that are semantically similar produce similar representations and things that are different produce different representations."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "We actually came up with this idea for a project of doing signature verification."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "So we would collect signatures from, like multiple signatures on the same person and then train a neural net to produce the same representation and then force the system to produce different representation for different signatures."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "This was actually, the problem was proposed by people from what was a subsidiary of AT&T at the time called NCR."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And they were interested in storing representation of the signature on the 80 bytes of the magnetic strip of a credit card."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "So we came up with this idea of having a neural net with 80 outputs that we would quantize on bytes so that we could encode the signature."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "And that encoding was then used to compare whether the signature matches or not."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So then you would sign, you would run through the neural net and then you would compare the output vector to whatever is stored on your card."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "Did it actually work?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "It worked, but they ended up not using it."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "Because nobody cares actually."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "I mean, the American financial payment

learning, right?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So you need positive and negative pairs."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And the problem with that is that, even though I had the original paper on this, I'm actually not very positive about it because it doesn't work in high dimension."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "If your representation is high dimensional, there's just too many ways for two things to be different."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And so you would need lots and lots and lots of negative pairs."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So there is a particular implementation of this, which is relatively recent from actually the Google Toronto group where, you know, Jeff Hinton is the senior member there."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "It's called SIMCLR, S I M C L R.

do not change the nature of the object."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "And so the standard scenario, which a lot of people working in this area are using is you use the type of distortion."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "So basically you do a geometric distortion."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "So one basically just shifts the image a little bit, it's called cropping."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Another one kind of changes the scale a little bit."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "Another one kind of rotates it."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "Another one changes the colors."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "You can do a shift in color balance or something like that, saturation."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "Another one sort of blurs it."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Another one adds noise."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So you have like a catalog of kind of standard things and people try to use the same ones for different algorithms so that they can compare."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "But some algorithms, some self supervised algorithm actually can deal with much bigger, like more aggressive data augmentation and some don't."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So that kind of makes the whole thing difficult."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "But that's the kind of distortions we're talking about."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And so you train with those distortions and then you chop off the last layer, a couple layers of the network and you use the representation as input to a classifier."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "You train the classifier on ImageNet, let's say, or whatever, and measure the performance."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And interestingly enough, the methods that are really good at eliminating the information that is irrelevant, which is the distortions between those images, do a good job at eliminating it."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And as a consequence, you cannot use the representations in those systems for things like object detection and localization because that information is gone."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So the type of data augmentation you need to do depends on the tasks you want eventually the system to solve and the type of data augmentation, standard data augmentation that we use today are only appropriate for object recognition or image classification."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "They're not appropriate for things like."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Can you help me out understand what wide localizations?"}, {"time": 3300, "text": "So you're saying it's just not good at the negative, like at classifying the negative, so that's why it can't be used for the localization?"},

it is."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "Like a bounding box, like they'd be able to actually."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "Okay, it can still find the object in the image, it's just not very good at finding the exact boundaries of that object, interesting."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "Interesting, which that's an interesting sort of philosophical question, how important is object localization anyway?"}, {"time": 3346, "text": "We're like obsessed by measuring image segmentation, obsessed by measuring perfectly knowing the boundaries of objects when arguably that's not that essential to understanding what are the contents of the scene."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "On the other hand, I think evolutionarily, the first vision systems in animals were basically all about localization, very little about recognition."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And in the human brain, you have two separate pathways for recognizing the nature of a scene or an object and localizing objects."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So you use the first pathway called eventual pathway for telling what you're looking at."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "The other pathway, the dorsal pathway, is used for navigation, for grasping, for everything else."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "And basically a lot of the things you need for survival are localization and detection."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Is similarity learning or contrastive learning, are these non contrastive methods the same as understanding something?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Just because you know a distorted cat is the same as a non distorted cat, does that mean you

hopeless."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "But let me take an example."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "You take an object, I describe a situation to you."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "I take an object, I put it on

no text in the world, I believe, that explains this."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "And so if you train a machine as powerful as it could be, your GPT 5000 or whatever it is, it's never gonna learn about this."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "That information is just not present in any text."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "Well, the question, like with the psych project, the dream I think is to have like 10 million, say facts like that, that give you a headstart, like a parent guiding you."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Now, we humans don't need a parent to tell us that the table will move, sorry, the

634, you know, in the list of problems we have to solve."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "So basic physics of the world is number one."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "What do you, just a quick tangent on data augmentation."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "So a lot of it is hard coded versus learned."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "Do you have any intuition that maybe there could be some weird data augmentation, like generative type of data augmentation, like doing something weird to images, which then improves the similarity learning process?"}, {"time": 3733, "text": "So not just kind of dumb, simple

of it, and then you train some giant neural net to reconstruct the parts that are missing."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "And until very recently, there was no working methods for that."}, {"time": 3779,

mask part of the image and you train a system, which in this case is a transformer because the transformer represents the image as non overlapping patches, so it's easy to mask patches and things like that."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Okay, but then my question transfers to that problem, the masking, like why should the mask be square or rectangle?"}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So it doesn't matter,

no, but like something that's challenging, like optimally challenging."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "So like, I mean, maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply, but you're, it seems like there's a data augmentation or masking, there's an interactive element with it."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Like you're almost like playing with an image."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And like, it's like the way we play with an image in our minds."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "No, but it's like dropout."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "It's like Boston machine training."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "You, you know, every time you see a percept, you also, you can perturb it in some way."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And then the principle of the training procedure is to minimize the difference of the output or the representation between the clean version and the corrupted version, essentially, right?"}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And you can do this in real time, right?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So, you know, Boston machine work like this, right?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "You show a percept, you tell the machine that's a good combination of activities or your input neurons."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "And then you either let them go their merry way without clamping them to values, or you only do this with a subset."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "And what you're doing is you're training the system so that the stable state of the entire network is the same regardless of whether it sees the entire input or whether it sees only part of it."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "You know, denoising autoencoder method is basically the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "You're training a system to reproduce the input, the complete inputs and filling the input and filling the blanks, regardless of which parts are missing, and that's really the underlying principle."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And you could imagine sort of, even in the brain, some sort of neural principle where, you know, neurons kind of oscillate, right?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So they take their activity and then temporarily they kind of shut off to, you know, force the rest of the system to basically reconstruct the input without their help, you know?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And, I mean, you could imagine, you know, more or less biologically possible processes."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And I guess with this

time."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "Because I was thinking, like, you might want to be clever about the way you do all these procedures, you know, but that's only, it's somehow costly to do every iteration, but it's not really."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And then there is, you know, data augmentation without explicit data augmentation."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "This data augmentation by

4622, "text": "You need to be able to act in a world and see the effect for you to be, to learn causal models of the world."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "So that's not obvious because you can observe others."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "You can observe others."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And you can infer that they're similar to you and then you can learn from that."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Yeah, but then you have to kind of hardwire that part, right, and then, you know, mirror neurons and all that stuff, right?"}, {"time": 4640, "text": "So, and it's not clear to me how you would do this in a machine."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So I think the action part would be necessary for having causal models of the world."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "The second reason it may be necessary, or at least more efficient, is that active learning basically, you know, goes for the jugular of what you don't know, right?"}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Is, you know, obvious areas of uncertainty about your world and about how the world behaves."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "And you can resolve this uncertainty by systematic exploration of that part that you don't know."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "And if you know that you don't know, then, you know, it makes you curious."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "You kind of look into situations that, and, you know, across the animal world, different species have different

make the process exist."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "The, so what process, what learning process is it that active learning makes more efficient?"}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And I'm asking that first question, you know, you know, we haven't answered that question yet."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "So, you know, I worry about active learning once this question is..."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "So it's the more fundamental question to ask."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "And if active learning or interaction increases the efficiency of the learning, see, sometimes it becomes very different if the increase is several orders of magnitude, right?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "Like... That's true."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "But fundamentally it's still the same thing and building up the intuition about how to, in a self supervised way to construct background models, efficient or inefficient, is the core problem."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "What do you think about Yoshua Bengio's talking about consciousness and all of these kinds of concepts?"}, {"time": 4764, "text": "Okay, I don't know what consciousness is, but..."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "It's a good opener."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "And to some extent, a lot of the things that are said about consciousness remind me of the questions people were asking themselves in the 18th century or 17th century when they discovered that, you know, how the eye works and the fact that the image at the back of the eye was upside down, right?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Because you have a lens."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "And so on your retina, the image that forms is an image of the world, but it's upside down."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "How is it that you see right side up?"}, {"time": 4797, "text": "And, you know, with what we know today in science, you know, we realize this question doesn't make any sense or is kind of ridiculous in some way, right?"}, {"time": 4805, "text": "So I think a lot of what is said about consciousness is of that nature."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "Now, that said, there is a lot of really smart people that for whom I have a lot of respect who are talking about this topic, people like David Chalmers, who is a colleague of mine at NYU."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "I have kind of an orthodox folk speculative hypothesis about consciousness."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So we're talking about the study of a world model."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "And I think, you know, our entire prefrontal cortex basically is the engine for a world model."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "But when we are attending at a particular situation, we're focused on that situation."}, {"time": 4846, "text":

a task that we do repeatedly, it goes from the sort of deliberate reasoning using model of the world and prediction and perhaps something like model predictive control, which I was talking about earlier, to something that is more subconscious that becomes automatic."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So I don't know if you've ever played against a chess grandmaster."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "I get wiped out in 10 plays, right?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And I have to think about my move for like 15 minutes."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "And the person in front of me, the grandmaster, would just react within seconds, right?"}, {"time": 4916, "text": "He doesn't need to think about it."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "That's become part of the subconscious because it's basically just pattern recognition at this point."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "Same, the first few hours you drive a car, you are really attentive, you can't do anything else."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "And then after 20, 30 hours of practice, 50 hours, the subconscious, you can talk to the person next to you, things like that, right?"}, {"time": 4937, "text": "Unless the situation becomes unpredictable and then you have to stop talking."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So that suggests you only have one model in your head."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "And it might suggest the idea that consciousness basically is the module that configures this world model of yours."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "You need to have some sort of executive kind of overseer that configures your world model for the situation at hand."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And that leads to kind of the really curious concept that consciousness is not a consequence of the power of our minds, but of the limitation of our brains."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "That because we have only one world model, we have to be conscious."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "If we had as many world models as situations we encounter, then we could do all of them simultaneously and we wouldn't need this sort of executive control that we call consciousness."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "And somehow maybe that executive controller, I mean, the hard problem of consciousness, there's some kind of chemicals in biology that's creating a feeling, like it feels to experience some of these things."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "That's kind of like the hard question is, what the heck is that and why is that useful?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Maybe the more pragmatic question, why is it useful to feel like this is really you experiencing this versus just like information being processed?"}, {"time": 5014, "text": "It could be just a very nice side effect of the way we evolved."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "That's just very useful to feel a sense of ownership to the decisions you make, to the perceptions you make, to the model you're trying to maintain."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "Like you own this thing and this is the only one you got and if you lose it, it's gonna really suck."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "And so you should really send the brain some signals about it."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "So what ideas do you believe might be true that most or at least many people disagree with?"}, {"time": 5051, "text": "Let's say in the space of machine learning."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "Well, it depends who you talk about, but I think, so certainly there is a bunch of

world is three dimensional, for example, is that hardwired?"}, {"time": 5070, "text": "Things like object permanence, is this something that we learn before the age of three months or so?"}, {"time":

detectors completely unsupervised with the equivalent of a few minutes of real time."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "So those things have to be learned."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "And there's also those MIT experiments where you kind of plug the optical nerve on the auditory cortex of a baby ferret, right?"}, {"time": 5130, "text": "And that auditory cortex becomes a visual cortex essentially."},

exactly eight years ago."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "It wasn't called FAIR yet."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "It took that name a few months later."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "And at the time I joined

ran it for three and a half years as a director, you know, hired the first few scientists and kind of set up the culture and organized it, you know, explained to the Facebook leadership what fundamental research was about and how it can work within industry and how it needs to be open and everything."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And so if you were to take out, you know, deep learning out of Facebook services now and Meta more generally, I mean, the company would literally crumble."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "I mean, it's completely built around AI these days."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "And it's really essential to the operations."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "So what happened after three and a half years is that I changed role, I became chief scientist."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "So I'm not doing day to day management of FAIR anymore."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "I'm more of a kind of, you know, think about strategy and things like that."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "And I carry my, I conduct my own research."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I have, you know, my own kind of research group working on self supervised learning and things like this, which I didn't have time to do when I was director."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "So now FAIR is run by Joel Pinot and Antoine Bord together because FAIR is kind of split in two now."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "There's something called FAIR Labs, which is sort of bottom up science driven research and FAIR Excel, which is slightly more organized for bigger projects that require a little more kind of focus and more engineering support and things like that."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "So Joel needs FAIR Lab and Antoine Bord needs FAIR Excel."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Where are they located?"}, {"time": 6774, "text": "It's delocalized all over."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So there's no question that the leadership of the company believes that this was a very worthwhile investment."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "And what that means is that it's there for the long run."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "So if you want to talk in these terms, which I don't like, this is a business model, if you want, where FAIR, despite being a very fundamental research lab brings a lot of value to the company, either mostly indirectly through other groups."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "Now what happened three and a half years ago when I stepped down was also the creation of Facebook AI, which was basically a larger organization that covers FAIR, so FAIR is included in it, but also has other organizations that are focused on applied research or advanced development of AI technology that is more focused on the products of the company."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "So less emphasis on fundamental research."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "Less fundamental, but it's still research."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of papers coming out of those organizations and the people are awesome and wonderful to interact with."}, {"time": 6846, "text":

6860, "text": "So FAIR is a subset of Meta AI."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "Is FAIR become like KFC?"}, {"time": 6864, "text": "It'll just keep the F.

That's a good call."}, {"time": 6894, "text": "I would keep FAIR and change the meaning of the F.

AI."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "So this would be meta FAIR, but people will call it FAIR, right?"}, {"time": 6910, "text": "And now Meta AI is part of the Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "So Meta now, the new Facebook is called Meta and it's kind of divided into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "And Reality Lab is about AR, VR, telepresence, communication technology and stuff like that."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "It's kind of the, you can think of it as the sort of, a combination of sort of new products and technology part of Meta."},

6958, "text": "That's a FAIR project."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Yeah, this is also the, no, but there is the other way, the haptic glove, right?"}, {"time": 6965, "text": "Yes, that's more Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "That's Reality Lab research."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "Reality Lab research."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "By the way, the touch sensors are super interesting."},

"What do you think about this whole kind of expansion of the view of the role of Facebook and Meta in the world?"}, {"time": 6990, "text": "Well, Metaverse really should be thought of as the next step in the internet, right?"}, {"time": 6995, "text": "Sort of trying to kind of make the experience more compelling of being connected either with other people or with content."}, {"time": 7009, "text":

us, things like that, right?"}, {"time": 7025, "text": "So there's a lot of social conventions that exist in the real world that we can try to transpose."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "Now, what is going to be eventually the, how compelling is it going to be?"}, {"time": 7036, "text": "Like, is it going to be the case that people are going to be willing to do this if they have to wear a huge pair of goggles all day?"}, {"time": 7046, "text": "But then again, if the experience is sufficiently compelling, maybe so."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "Or if the device that you have to wear is just basically a pair of glasses, and technology makes sufficient progress for that."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "AR is a much easier concept to grasp that you're going to have augmented reality glasses that basically contain some sort of virtual assistant that can help you in your daily lives."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "But at the same time with the AR, you have to contend with reality."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "With VR, you can completely detach yourself from reality."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "So it gives you freedom."}, {"time": 7077, "text": "It might be easier to design worlds in VR."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "Yeah, but you can imagine the metaverse being a mix, right?"}, {"time": 7086, "text": "Or like, you can have objects that exist in the metaverse that pop up on top of the real world, or only exist in virtual reality."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "Okay, let me ask the hard question."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "Oh, because all of this was easy so far."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "This was easy."}, {"time": 7100, "text": "The Facebook, now Meta, the social network has been painted by the media as a net negative for society, even destructive and evil at times."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "You've pushed back against this, defending Facebook."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "Can you explain your defense?"}, {"time": 7116, "text": "Yeah, so the description, the company that is being described in some media is not the company we know when we work inside."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "And it could be claimed that a lot of employees are uninformed about what really goes on in the company, but

involved in everything, but certainly not in decision about content moderation or anything like this, but I have some decent vision of what goes on."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "And this evil that is being described, I just don't see it."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And then I think there is an easy story to buy, which is that all the bad things in the world and the reason your friend believe crazy

Facebook or social media."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So you could say if social media just accelerated, but no, I mean, it's basically a continuous evolution by some measure of polarization in the US."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And then you compare this with other countries like the West half of Germany because you can go 40 years in the East side or Denmark or other countries."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "And they use Facebook just as much and they're not getting more polarized, they're getting less polarized."}, {"time": 7312, "text": "So if you want to look for a causal relationship

handle uncertainty."}, {"time": 7708, "text": "And instead of directly predicting the next frames of the clip, you also run those through another neural net."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "So, you now

to do is learn a representation of those two video clips that is maximally informative about the video clips themselves, but is such that you can predict the representation of the second video clip

matter."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "What you want is informative representations of the two video clips that are mutually predictable."}, {"time": 7768, "text": "What that means is that there's a lot

be revealed, and I can somewhat predict what that room is gonna look like, but I may not be able to predict the details of the texture of the ground and where the tiles are ending and stuff like that, right?"}, {"time": 7794, "text": "So, those are irrelevant details that perhaps my representation will eliminate."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "And so, what I need is to train this second neural net in

reading a paper, in finding the beautiful amidst the mistakes and the flaws and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "Like if you're the person that first discovered a powerful paper, and you get to be proud of that discovery, then that gives a huge incentive to you."}, {"time": 8427, "text": "That's a big part of my proposal, actually, where I describe that as, you know, if your evaluation of papers is predictive of future success, okay, then your reputation should go up as a reviewing entity."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "So yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "I mean, I

you know, Andrew McCallum, who started Open Review."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "And the reason why we picked Open Review for iClear initially, even though it was very early for them, is because my hope

the answer to that."}, {"time": 8829, "text": "And I think actually that thought also, I think you were hinting at the famous Libet experiments where he got his subjects to perform some kind of random

way a kind of branding point, how we brand this."}, {"time": 9093, "text": "The more important point is we just don't know enough about the workings of the brain to know whether there are in strongly

Media Lab."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "And we, one of the first years in 2017 that we flew a zero G flight, we took the social robot along and tried to do a little bit of a very scaled down human study

mission."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "And I do think that that could have a powerful role in the mental health and just the stability of a crew is to have some other robot friends come along."},

clear your head."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "And in that sense, you need to build habitats that are homes that really care for the humans inside them and have, whether it's biophilia and a place where

expert in this area but an anecdote that I'll share."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "My understanding is that NASA has still not decided whether it's better to send married couples or single crew members in terms of, you want some level of stability, you don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships like you're alluding to before, but they can't decide because married couples also fight and have a really tough dynamic."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?"}, {"time": 4377, "text": "And we're starting to test some of these things with the civilian crews that are growing up with Inspiration4, like last fall with SpaceX and Axe One that's gonna fly in a few days here in March."},

up, a lot of marriages got closer together."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "So it's like, and then the single people, some of them went off the cliff and some of them discovered their new happiness and meaning and so on."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Is there a thorough way to really test that?"}, {"time": 4434, "text":

hope."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "You don't have like a Apollo 13 situation that doesn't quite make it back."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge."}, {"time":

anything."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "Three years is such a challenge compared to these other domains that we've been getting more used to in terms of human spaceflight."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "So

robust habitats that don't depend on astronauts being so impeccably well trained."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "So we're gonna make it better for inclusion and just opening access to space."}, {"time":

is, because you've worked with a lot of different kinds of people, culturally, what's the difference between SpaceX or commercial type of efforts NASA and MIT?"}, {"time": 4630, "text": "And academia."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "Academia."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "Yeah, so the first part of your question, I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space."}, {"time": 4638, "text":

right?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "That was, that's something different."}, {"time": 390, "text": "That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic, and he wasn't, and he was basically trying to send

long, grueling months and years of violence are like the problem and the puzzle."}, {"time": 424, "text": "And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time talking about the international version of gang banging."}, {"time": 432, "text": "It's a different phenomenon."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap, let's call him, not to add confusion, that doesn't qualify

sought?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Or is it the shortness of it?"}, {"time": 457, "text": "Is it all of those combined?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group,

it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is."}, {"time": 527, "text": "As you describe for everybody."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So everybody is losing in this war."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Everybody loses something from war."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And there was usually, not always, but the point is there was usually a way to get what you wanted or be better off without having to fight over it."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So there's this, fighting is just politics by other means."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And it's just inefficient, costly, brutal, devastating means."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so that's like the deep insight."}, {"time": 556, "text": "And so I kind of wanted to say, so I guess like what's not war?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions because there's reams and reams of political science papers written on like what's a war, what's not a war."}, {"time": 570, "text": "People disagree."}, {"time": 574, "text": "I just wanted to say, war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Or war is the violence that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 581, "text": "There's a whole bunch of other violence, including gang banging and skirmishes and things that might make sense, precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating or they're not particularly costly."}, {"time": 593, "text": "War is the thing that's just so costly we should be trying to avoid is maybe like the meta way I think about it."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Nevertheless, definitions are interesting."}, {"time": 602, "text": "So outside of the academic bickering, every time you try to define something, I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates."}, {"time": 613, "text": "So the destination doesn't matter because the moment you arrive at the definition, you lose the power."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Yeah, one of the interesting thing, I mean, so people, if you wanna do, some of what I do is just quantitative analysis of conflict."}, {"time": 626, "text": "And if you wanna do that, if you wanna sort of run statistics on war, then you have to code it all up."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And then lots of people have done that."}, {"time": 634, "text": "There's four or five major data sets where people or teams of people have over time said, we're gonna code years of war between these groups or within a country."}, {"time": 644, "text": "And what's interesting is how difficult, these data sets don't often agree."}, {"time": 648, "text": "You have to make all of these, the decision gets really complicated."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Like when does the war begin, right?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "Does it begin when a certain number of people have been killed?"}, {"time": 658, "text": "Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing and sort of little terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed and then eventually turns into war?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Do we backdate it to like when the first act of violence started?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "And then what do we do with all the times when there was like that low scale, low intensity violence or bombs lobbed and do we call those wars or maybe only if they eventually get worse?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And the defensive and the offensive aspect."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So everybody, Hitler in World War II, it seems like he never attacked anybody."}, {"time": 694, "text": "He's always defending against the unjust attack of everybody else as he's taken over the world."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So that's like information propaganda that every side is trying to communicate to the world."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So you can't listen to necessarily information like self report data."}, {"time": 712, "text": "You have to kind of look past that somehow."}, {"time": 715, "text": "Maybe look, especially in the modern world as much as possible at the data."}, {"time": 718, "text": "How many bombs dropped?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "How many people killed?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "How the number of estimates of the number of troops moved from one location to another and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 729, "text": "And the other interesting thing is there's quantitative analysis of war."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So for example, I was looking at just war index or people trying to measure, trying to put a number on what wars are seen as just and not."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Oh really, I've never seen that."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It's, there's numbers behind it."}, {"time": 750, "text": "So it's great because again, as you do an extensive quantification of justice, you start to think what actually contributes to our thought that for example, World War II is a just war and other wars are not."}, {"time": 769, "text": "A lot of it is about intent and some of the other factors like that you look at which is prolonged, the degree of violence that is necessary versus not necessary given the greater good, some measure of the greater good of people, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 786, "text": "Then there's reasons for war, you know, looking to free people or to stop a genocide versus conquering land, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And people try to put a number behind it."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And a lot of."}, {"time": 800, "text": "It's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is, I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever, suppose I think my God tells me to do something or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks that something that another group is doing is repugnant."}, {"time": 816, "text": "I'm curious, are they evaluating the validity of that claim or just the idea that like, well, you said it was repugnant, you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "I think, and that could be corrected on a lot of this, but I think this is always looking at wars after they happened and trying to take a global perspective from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So you're not weighing disproportionately the opinions of the people who waged the war."}, {"time": 845, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because, I mean, one is to just point out that wars, actually most wars aren't necessary."}, {"time": 856, "text": "And so in the sense that there's another way to get what you wanted."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And so on one level, there's no just war."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Now that's not true because take an example like the US invasion of Afghanistan."}, {"time": 870, "text": "The United States has been attacked."}, {"time": 872, "text": "There's a culpable agent, reliable evidence that this is Al Qaeda."}, {"time": 879, "text": "They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky."}, {"time": 886, "text": "It seems that there was an attempt to say hand him over or else and they said, no way."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Now you can make an argument that invading and attacking is strategically the right thing to do in terms of sending signals to your future enemies or if you think it's important to bring someone to justice, in this case, Al Qaeda, then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion."}, {"time": 911, "text": "But it hinges on the fact that the other side just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing, which is say, okay, we'll give them up."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And so it was completely avoidable in one sense."}, {"time": 926, "text": "But if you believe, and I think it's probably true, if you believe that for their own ideological and other reasons, you know, Mullah Omar in particular and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this, then now you're not left with very many good choices."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And now, you know, I didn't wanna talk about is that a just war or is that, what's justice or not?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "I just wanted to point out that like one side's intransigence, if that's indeed what happened, one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains that you could be satisfied with and now you're left with really no other strategic option but to invade."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I think that's a slight oversimplification, but I think that's like one way to describe what happened."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So your book is fascinating and your perspective on this is fascinating."}, {"time": 978, "text": "I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times to try to get a clarity."}, {"time": 982, "text": "But the thesis is that war is costly, usually costly for everybody."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war because you're going to, from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason, a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "But there's also human beings in this mix."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And there is ideas of justice."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "So for example, I don't want to, my memory doesn't serve me well on which wars were seen as justice, very, very few in the 20th century of the many that have been there."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "The wars that were seen as just, first of all, the most just war seen is World War II by far."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold that's seen as just, everything that's seen as unjust."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And I think the ones that are seen as more just are the ones that are fast, that you have a very specific purpose, you communicate that purpose honestly with the global community, and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out to do sort of, it's like rescue missions."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "It's almost like policing work."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "If there's somebody suffering, you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "I think World War II is seen in that way, that there's an obvious aggressor that is causing a lot of suffering in the world and looking to expand the scale of that suffering."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And so you strike, I mean, given the scale, you strike as hard and as fast as possible to stop the expansion of the suffering."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So that's kind of how they see."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework that you've presented and look at Hitler and think, well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia, Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union, America, the United States of America, same with Japan."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Is it in their long term interest?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So for me, who cares about alleviating human suffering in the world, yes, it's not."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "It seems like almost no war is just."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it also seems somehow deeply human to fight."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Can you try to get at that?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Because it seems that war, there is some, that drama of war seems to beat in all human hearts."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like it's in there somewhere."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Maybe it's, maybe that's like a relic of the past and we need to get rid of it."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "It's deeply irrational."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Okay, so obviously we go to war and obviously there's a lot of violence."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And so we have to explain something and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with, I think it was just useful to sort of start and point out, actually, there's really, really, really, really strong incentives not to go to war because it's gonna be really costly."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And so all of these other human or strategic things, all these things, the circumstantial things that will eventually lead us to go to war have to be pretty powerful before we go there."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And most of the time."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And that's why you also describe very importantly that war throughout human history is actually rare."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "We usually avoid it."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "You know, most people don't know about the US invasion of Haiti in 1994."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "I mean, a lot of people know about it, but people just don't pay attention to it."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "We don't, we're gonna, you know, the history books and school kids are gonna learn about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades, and nobody's going to put this one in the history books."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And it's because it didn't actually happen because before the troops could land, the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said fine."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti, to this new dictator who's refused to let a Democratic president take power."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And tries to convince him to step down or else."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And he says, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And then he shows him a video, and it's basically troop planes and all these things taking off."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And he's like, this is not live."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "This is two hours ago."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So it's a, and basically he basically gives up right there."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So that was."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "That's a powerful move."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I think Powell might've been one of his teachers in like a US military college, because a lot of these military dictators trained at some point."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So they had some, there was some personal relationships at least between people in the US government and this guy that they were trying to use."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "The point is, and that's like what should have happened."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "That makes sense, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Like, yeah, maybe I could mount an insurgency and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the cost of war cause I'm the dictator."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And maybe he's human and he just wants to fight or gets angry or it's just in his mind, whatever he's doing."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's like, this does not make sense."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And that's what happens most of the time, but we don't write so many books about it."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And now some political scientists go and they count up all of the nations that could fight cause they have some dispute and they're right next to one another, or they look at the ethnic groups that could fight with one another cause there's some tension and they're right next to one another."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And then whatever, some number like 999 out of 1000 don't fight because they just find some other way."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace because that's the sensible thing to do."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And that's what we all do, we loathe in peace."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And we loathed the Soviet Union in relative peace for decades and India loathes Pakistan in peace."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, again, it was in the newspapers, but most people didn't, I think, take note."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan and common suit."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So they were like, yeah, this is, we do not want to go to war."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "This will be bad."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation that this was an accident."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And so these things find to the radar."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And so we overestimate, I think, how likely it is the sides are gonna fight."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "But then of course, things do happen."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Like Russia did invade the Ukraine and didn't find some negotiated deal."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And so then the book is sort of about half the book is just sort of laying out, actually like there's just different ways this breaks down."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And some of them are human."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Some of them are this, I actually don't think war beats in our heart."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "We're really, really good."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence and we're okay getting angry and vengeance and we have principles that will sometimes lead us, but we're actually really, really, really good at cooperation."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And so that's, again, I'm not trying to write some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great and we're all happy and we don't really fight."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "It's more just to say, let's start, let's be like a doctor."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people, but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health and that most people are healthy."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And that's gonna make me a better doctor."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And that's, I'm kind of saying the same thing."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Let's be better doctors of politics in the world by recognizing that like normal state is health."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And then we're gonna identify like what are the diseases that are causing this warfare."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So yeah, the natural state of the human body with the immune system and all the different parts wants to be healthy and is really damn good at being healthy, but sometimes it breaks down."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Let's understand how it breaks down."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So what are the five ways that you list that are the roots of war?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "They're sort of things that rhyme, right?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "In the interview, because it's not all the same."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "There's like lots of reasons to go to war."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "There's this great line, there's a reason for every war and a war for every reason."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And it's kind of overwhelming, right?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And it's overwhelming for a lot of people."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And I think one of the gifts of social science is actually people have started to organize this for us."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Buckets that rhyme."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Buckets with some economics."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And bad at metaphors."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So the idea was that like that basic, like something overrides these incentives."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And I guess I was saying there's five ways that they get overrided."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And three are, I'd call strategic."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Like they're kind of logical."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "There's circumstances that, and this is, they're sort of, where strategic is, strategy is like game theory."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "You could use those two things interchangeably."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But game theory is sort of making it sound more complicated, I think, than it is."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "It's basically saying that there's times when this is like the optimal choice because of circumstances."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And one of them is when the people who are deciding don't bear those costs."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive that's gonna, that's, if they don't, if they're ignoring the cost, then maybe the costs of war are not so material."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "That's a contributing factor."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Another is just, there's uncertainty, and we could talk about that, but there's just the absence of information means that it actually, there's circumstances where it's your best choice to attack."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "There's this thing that political economists call commitment problems, which are basically saying there's some big power shift that you can avoid by attacking now."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So it's like a dynamic incentive."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something from happening in the future, I can attack now."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And because of the structure of incentives, it actually makes sense for me, even though war is, in theory, really costly, or it is really costly nonetheless."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And then there's these sort of human things."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "One's a little bit like just war."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "One sort of thing, there's like ideologies or principles or things we value that weigh against those costs, like exterminating the heretical idea or standing up for a principle might be so valuable to me that I'm willing to use violence, even if it's costly."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And there's nothing irrational about that."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities, all the passions and all of the most importantly, I think, like misperceptions, the way we get, like we basically make wrong calculations about whether or not war is the right decision."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy or misjudge ourselves."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So if you put all those things into buckets, how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way and how much of it is a giant human mess?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So four of those five are really, on some level, easy to think strategically and model in a simple way in the sense that any of us can do it."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "We do this all the time."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Think of bargaining in a market for a carpet or something or whatever you bargained for, you're thinking a few steps ahead about what your opponent's going to do."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And you stake out a high price, like a low price, and the seller stakes out a high price."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And you might both say, oh, I refuse to, I could never accept that."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And there's all this sort of cheap talk, but you kind of understand where you're going and it's efficient to like find a deal and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So we all understand this game theory and the strategy, I think intuitively."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Or maybe even a closer example is like, suppose, I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict or any normal kind of legal, it's not yet a legal dispute, right?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor or somebody else."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Most of us don't end up going to court."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Going to court is like the war option."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to avoid."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "We ought to be able to find something between ourselves that doesn't require this hiring lawyers and a long drawn out trial."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And most of the time we do, right?"}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And so we all understand that incentive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And then for those five buckets, so everything except all the irrational and the misperceptions are really easy to model."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Then from a technical standpoint, it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And I'm not a game theorist."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so I'm more channeling my colleagues to do this and what I know, but it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book is like there's all these ideas out there that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars and just bring some order to the morass of reasons."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "I'll defer to you actually."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Well, I think it's because unfortunately it's very like engineering, it's very well defined."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "The problem is well defined."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "So it is true it's not rocket science, but it is not true."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "It's easy because it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "But the problem, the downside of game theory is not that it helps us make sense of the world."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "It projects a simple model of the world that brings us comfort in thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And sometimes that simplification is actually getting at the core first principles on understanding of something."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So for example, I mean, mutually shared destruction is a very simple model and people argue all the time whether that's actually a good model or not, but there's empirical fact that we're still alive as a human civilization."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And also in the game theoretic sense, do we model individual leaders and their relationships?"}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Do we, the staff, the generals, or do we also have to model the culture, the people, the suffering of the people, the economic frustration or the anger or the distrust?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Do you have to model all those things?"}, {"time": 1864, "text": "Do they come into play?"}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And sometimes, I mean, again, we could be romanticizing those things from a historical perspective, but when you look at history and you look at the way wars start, it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding escalates, escalates, escalates, and just builds on top of itself and all of a sudden it's an all out war."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things and take the game theory too seriously."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And some, and people who study those things and write those models and people like me who use them can sometimes make that mistake."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "I think that's not the mistake that most people make most often."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And what's actually true is I think most people, we're actually really quick, whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq, we're really quick to blame that on the humanness and the culture."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's either desire for revenge and vengeance or some private agenda or blood for oil."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So we're really quick to blame it on these things."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "And then we're really, we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack, which I think were probably dominant."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "I think those things might've been true to a degree, but I don't think they were enough to ever bring those wars about."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Just like, I think people are very quick to sort of, in this current invasion to sort of talk about Putin's grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great or nationalist ideals and the mistakes and the miscalculations are really quick to sort of say, oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause, but maybe even stop there and not see some of the strategic incentives."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so, I guess we have to do both, but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war is just such a big problem."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "It's just so costly that the strategic incentives and the things that game theory has given us are like really important in understanding why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions or vengeance actually matters."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Cause those do matter, but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal is so narrow because of the circumstances."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And so let's not, it's sort of like saying like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Pneumonia killed them, obviously, but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "All of the fundamentals and the circumstances were like made them very fragile."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And that's how I think all the strategic forces make that situation fragile."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "And then the miscalculations and all of these things you just said, which are so important are kind of like the pneumonia."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And you're saying that people don't disproportionately pay attention to the leaders."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I mean, it wasn't, it took me a long time to learn to recognize them."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And it takes many people, you know, it took and it took generations of social scientists years and years to figure some of this out and to sort of help people understand it and clarify concepts."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So it's not, it's just not that easy."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "No, it's not hard."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I think it's possible to, just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book in graduate school or from reading and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff, but it's still really hard."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And so that's kind of what I was trying to do is like close that gap and just make it, help people recognize these things in the wild."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "Before we zoom back out, let me at a high level first ask, what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "How do you analyze it within your framework about war?"}, {"time": 2112, "text": "A Russian colleague of mine, Konstantin Sonin tells this story about a visiting Ukrainian professor who's at the university."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And one night he's walking down the street and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason and a mugger stops him and demands the phones."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And it's sort of like dead pan way, Konstantin says, and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And I think that's a little bit like what happened."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Most of us in that situation would hand over cell phones."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger and the Ukrainian people are being asked to hand over this thing and they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "And the fact is most people do."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant or an autocrat or a murderous warlord who says, hand this over, they hand it over."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "And that's why there are so many unequal imperial relationships in the world."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "That's what empire is."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Empire is success of people saying, fine, we'll give up our some degree of freedom or sovereignty because you're too powerful."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "And the Ukrainian said, no way, this is just too precious."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And so I said, one of those buckets were that there's a set of values."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "There's sometimes there's something that we value that is so valuable to us and important."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Sometimes it's terrible, sometimes it's the extermination of another people, but sometimes it's something noble like liberty

knew what they were probably risking."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians any more than I would blame Americans for the American Revolution."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "It's actually a very similar story."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "You had a tyrannical, militarily superior, pretty non democratic entity come and say, you're gonna have partial sovereignty."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "And Americans for ideological reasons said, no way."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And that people like Bernard Bailyn and other historians, that's like the dominant story of the American Revolution."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "It was the ideological origins, this attachment, this idea of liberty."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons I think why this happened, but I think for me, it starts with Ukrainians failing to make that sensible quote unquote rational deal that says we should relinquish some of our sovereignty because Russia is more powerful than we are."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So there's a very clinical look at the war."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim on a land, builds up troops and invades."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "The way to avoid suffering there and the way to avoid death and a way to avoid war is to back down and basically let, there's a list

to understand and we won't know this but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?"}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Well, on the eve of the war, Ukraine was poorer in the per person terms than it was in 1990."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "The economy is just completely stagnated."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And Russia, meanwhile, like many other parts of the region, sort of has boomed to a degree."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "I mean, certainly because of oil and gas but also for a variety of other reasons and Putin's consolidated political control."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And from a very cold blooded and calculated point of view, I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this is says, look, we were temporarily weak after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rest in the West

regained some of our strength."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "We've consolidated political control, we've count our people, we have a stronger economy and we somehow got Germany and other European nations

enough to demand it."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you've been taking advantage of the situation which is maybe a fair impartial analysis."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And in the West, but more specifically Ukraine said, but that's a price too high, which I totally respect."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Maybe I'd like to think I'd make that same decision but that's the answer."}, {"time": 2477,

that their power said they quote unquote deserve."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Just like Americans said to the Britain, yeah, of course we ought to accept semi sovereignty but we refuse and we'd rather endure a bloody fight that we might lose than take this."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so you need some of these other five buckets, you need them to understand the situation, you need to sort of,

these reasons."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "I think we could, that's why we admire the leaders of the American Revolution

the suffering."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "And so they were too quick to go to war."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders, combined with, you mingle it with this,

of different stuff in there."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And I'm just trying to say, like, let's be clear that just about the shared logic of these things is maybe just, you know, they're really dissimilar, but let's be clear about the shared logic."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "And if it were true that deep down, we were aggressive people who just liked violence and enjoyed the blood, or some percentage of us do, that would be there too."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And so I just want to say that's, but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?"}, {"time": 3722, "text": "When

war?"}, {"time": 3758, "text": "So...

war."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And so you still internalize that a little bit."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "If I had to say like, you know, in my three buckets or through my buckets so far, I sort of started with like Ukrainian intransigence, and then I jumped, and then I said the essentially, then you really have to understand Russian autocracy just to understand why they would ask something so cruel."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "But I mean, I think the uncertainty is really important here as well."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things, the way this has played out, and just in some ways how many, in how many ways we've been surprised."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "We've been surprised by the unity and the coherence of the West and the sanctions."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "That's sort of what's happened is it was in the realm of possibility, but it was sort of like the best case scenario from the perspective of the West and the worst case scenario for the Russians."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "The second thing is just the pluckiness and the effectiveness and the intransigence and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance."},

Russia, the best realization in some sense for in terms of revealed strength and resolve."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And then the other thing that's been revealed is just how like the corruption and ineptitude and problems on the Russian military side."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "Again, within the realm of possibility, maybe people who really knew the Russian military are less surprised than the rest of us, but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "And so Putin asking this terrible price and expecting Ukraine to roll over or the West to roll over at least to a degree was based on like a different set of, was based on just expecting something in the middle of the probability distribution and not one of all these different tale events."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And so the fact that the world's so uncertain and the fact that Putin can come with a different set of expectations than the Ukrainians and the West and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing on just what the facts are because we live in an uncertain world."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Everyone's quick to say, oh, he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "I think he just, he got a really bad draw in terms of what the realized outcomes are here."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense, except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence is the tragedy."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "Well, there's also economic pain, not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people, but the whole world."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "So it, you know, you could talk about things that we are surprised from an analysis perspective of small victories here or there, but I think it's universally true that everybody loses once again in this war."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Right, and so the question is just like, when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade when Ukraine didn't give this up?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved, quote unquote, based on its power in the world, it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And the uncertainty around that made it potentially more likely that he would choose to do this."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "But in particular, one of the other things that I think is probably less important in this context, but still plays a role, but less important than many wars, is the fact that it's really hard to resolve that uncertainty, right?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "In theory, Ukraine should be able to say, look, this is exactly how resolved we are, we're super resolved, and your military is not as strong as you think it is."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You mean before the conflict even begins?"}, {"time": 4007, "text": "Everybody should be like, you know what?"}, {"time": 4008, "text": "You lay on the table, here's my cards, here's your cards."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this, you can use that uncertainty to your advantage."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?"}, {"time": 4020, "text": "And so anyone who's ever played poker and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficiency, that's the analogy in some ways to war."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "It's not the perfect analogy, but the uncertainty and the circumstance, you don't have to miscalculate."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "The fact that if you bluff and lose, it doesn't mean that you miscalculated."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "You made an optimal choice, given the uncertainty of the situation, to take a gamble."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff and just to fold or to just not ping in that round."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And so the uncertainty of the situation gives both sides incentives to bluff, gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "And then at some point, the other side says, you know what, you say you're resolved."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "You say you're gonna mount an insurgency."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "Every other, you know, people on my border has folded and you're gonna fold too, the minute the tanks roll in and the minute the Air Force comes in, I'm gambling that you're bluffing."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation just causes a lot of short wars, actually, because it's this sort of bluff and call dynamic that goes on."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "And, you know, the thing that's worth thinking is we might end up at a place in a few months where the thing that Ukraine concedes is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "Russia's on it, I want a neutral, I mean, who knows how, it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And that sadly is like the best case, that feels like the best case scenario right now, which is the war is just five months and not five years."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "Given the current situation."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Because the suffering has already happened, and lost homes, people moving, having to see their home in rubble, and millions of people, refugees having to escape the country, and hate flourishes versus the common humanity as it does with war."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "And on top of all of that, if

4454, "text": "And so he's doing on some level the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing in mechanical terms, which is to try to manipulate people's references."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But doing it in a sinister, malevolent, evil, self serving way because it's really in his interest, whereas this was anything but, right, in the Churchill example."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "The dark human thing is like there's moments in World War II where Hitler's propaganda, he began to believe his own propaganda."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "I think he probably always believed..."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "I think he was a sincere believer."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "Well no, no, no, but there's a lot of places where there was uncertainty and they decided to do propaganda and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty in his own mind."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "So for example, he believed until very late that America is a weakling, militarily and as an economic power and just the spirit of the people."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "And that was part of the propaganda they were producing and because of that propaganda when he became the head of the army, he was making military actions, he like nonchalantly started war with America, with the United States of America, where he didn't need to at all."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "He could have avoided that completely, but he thought, eh, whatever."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "They're easy."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So I think that propaganda first, belief second."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "And I think as a human being, as a dictator, when you start to believe the lies with which you're controlling the populace, you're not able to, you become detached from this person that's able to resolve in a very human way the conflict in the world."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "I mean, when I said the meta, the big common factor that causes war over and over and over again is unaccountable power."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "It's not just because it's mechanically, like one of my five explanations is saying, well, if you're unaccountable, you don't bear the costs of war, you might have private incentives."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "So yes, bargains are harder to find, but it leads to all these nasty interactions."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "So earlier I said there's this interaction between the values and the unchecked leaders because those idiosyncratic values of your leader become more important when they're unchecked."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "But the uncertainty point you just made is like a deep point."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "It's to say actually that like the fundamental problem that all autocrats have is an information problem because nobody wants to give them the right information."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And they have very few ways to aggregate information if they're not popular, right?"}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And so there's a whole cottage industry of political science sort of talking about like why autocrats love fixed elections and why they love Twitter and why they actually like it in a controlled way."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "It solves an information problem."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "Like that's your crucial, if you're like Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin, you need to solve an information problem just to avoid having rebellion on your hands in your own country every day because uncertainty kind of gets magnified and you get all this distorted information in this apparatus of control."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "And so that's like another nasty interaction between uncertainty and unchecked leaders is you end up in this situation where you're getting bad information."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "And it's not that you believe your own lies."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "It's just that you sort of believe, you're sort of averaging what you believe over the available information and you don't realize that it's such a distorted and biased information source."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "One of the other things about this time that was a surprise to me in the fog of uncertainty, how sort of seemingly likely nuclear war became."}, {"time": 4679,

a random stroll away from zero percent probability into this kind of land of maybe like, it's hard to know, but it's like, oh wow, we're actually normally talking about this as if this is part of the calculus, part of the options."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "But before we talk about nuclear war, because I'm going to need a drink, do you need to go to the bathroom?"}, {"time": 4708, "text": "Sure, I'll take a break."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "So back to nuclear war."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "That people were nonchalantly speaking about nuclear wars if it doesn't lead to the potential

the century?"}, {"time": 4744, "text": "Well, you know, the official doomsday clock for nuclear warfare sits in the lobby of my building."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

it's something that this group of physicists sort of said to sort of mark just how close we are to nuclear catastrophe, and they started it decades ago."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And it's a clock, and it's sort of how close are we to midnight, where midnight is nuclear Armageddon or the destruction of humanity."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "And it's been sitting, I mean, it's actually, it hasn't moved as close to, it hasn't moved as close to midnight in the last few weeks as it probably should have, only because it was already so close."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "There's actually limited room for it to move for a bunch of other reasons."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "I think there's a whole political thing that once it's really hard, it's really easy to move it closer."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "And it's really hard if you're the person in charge of that clock to move it away, right?"}, {"time": 4798, "text": "Because that's always very controversial."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "So it always sits there, but it forces you to think about it a little bit every day."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "And I admit I was nonchalant about it until recently in a way that many, many other people were."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "I still think the risk is very low, but kind of for the reasons we've talked, it's just so unimaginably costly that nobody wants to go that route."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So it's like the extreme version of my whole argument was why we most of the time don't fight is because it's just so damn costly."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "And so that's the incentive not to use this."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "And if they do use it, that's the incentive to use it in a very restrained way."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "But because we know we do go to war and there's all these things that interfere with it, including miscalculation and all of these human foibles, and several of those nuclear powers are not accountable leaders, I think we have to be a lot more worried than many of us were very recently."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "I pointed out earlier the whole reason we're in this mess is because the only people who have this private interest in having Ukraine give up its freedom is this Russian cabal and elite that gets their power and is preserved and is threatened by Ukrainian democracy."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "How far would they go to hang onto power when push came to shove is I think the thing that worries me the most."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "And is plainly what worries most people about the risk of nuclear war."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Like at what point does that unchecked leadership decide that this is worth it?"}, {"time": 4901, "text": "Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "And I don't know that any of us have really fully thought through all of that calculus and what's going on."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "Very recently around the anniversary of January 6th there were a lot of questions about was the United States going to have another civil war?"}, {"time": 4922, "text": "On the one hand I think it's almost unimaginable."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "Sort of like in the same way I think that a nuclear war and complete Armageddon is unimaginable."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "But I remember something that when both of those questions get asked I remember something I was in the audience of listening to some great economists speak about 20 years ago about the risk of an Argentina style financial meltdown of the United States."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Like what's the total financial collapse?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "And they said you know what the risk is vanishingly small but that's terrifying because until recently the answer was zero."}, {"time": 4960,

risk of a civil war in the U.S. and that's how I feel about the risk of nuclear war is it's higher than it used to be and that should terrify us all."}, {"time": 4977, "text": "To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff seems to happen like overnight like super quick and it escalates super quick when it happens."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "So it's not like I don't know what I imagine but it just happens like if a nuclear war happened it would be something like a plane like in this case with Ukraine a NATO plane shut down over some piece of land by the Russian forces or so the narrative would go but it doesn't even matter what's true or not in order to spark the first moment of escalation and then it just goes, goes, goes."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "Well I think that happens sometimes."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "I mean again it's this thing that you know what social scientists call it selection on the dependent variable."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "Like there's all these times when that didn't happen when it stopped, when it escalated one step and then people paused or escalated two steps and people said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."}, {"time": 5064, "text": "So the escalation does happen quickly sometimes except when it doesn't which fortunately."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So we remember the ones when it does."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "It's really important to think about all that."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "Like I remember talking to I think Elon Musk on this podcast I was sort of like talking about the horrors of war and so on and then he

is just peaceful like farming life."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "We kind of remember the wars but most of human history is just you know is life."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "And the story of political

groups, is that less frequent?"}, {"time": 5260, "text": "Well you know, it's not clear that he's right that there's fewer wars, you might say that there's wars are more rare because they're more costly because our weapons are so brutal."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "The costs of war go up, as the costs of war go up not entirely but for the most part that gives us an incentive not to have them

us, given us a more peaceful world now than a couple hundred years ago."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "That's something to think about so obviously looking at his hypothesis, looking at his data and others like him but I have noticed one thing which is the amount of pushback he gets."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "That there is this, this is speaking to the general point that you made which is like we overemphasize the anecdotal like the and don't look objectively at the aggregate data as much."}, {"time": 5331, "text": "There's a general cynicism about the world and not, I don't even mean cynicism, it's almost like cynicism porn or something like that where people just get, for some reason they get a little bit excited to talk about the destruction of human civilization in a weird

peaceful."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "And so what's going on there?"}, {"time": 5458, "text": "I mean one thing is there's a hierarchy of organizations so that above these reasonably well organized

in prison."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "Well they're, whatever, if I'm on a cell block with you I'm meeting you anyways."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "So actually imprisoning leaders and putting them in

to peace."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So having these guys all in the same prison patios is actually, it reduces imperfect information and uncertainty."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "It provides a place for them to bargain, they can talk."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "And so La Oficina is like a lot of these informal meetings."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "And they have these tools that they use to control the street gangs."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "So instead of there being like 400 gangs all sort of in this anarchic situation of competing for territory and constantly at war, the Rezones are keeping

more honest than the sanctions between nations."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "Exactly, but they will sit them down, they'll provide, they'll help them negotiate, they will provide, I said there are these

to, what's the solution?"}, {"time": 5598, "text": "Well, I'm going to provide commitment."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "I'm going to like enforce this deal."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "And yeah, you

win a war is going to change a lot in the next decade or two, maybe even in the next few years."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "And so if we are in a much better bargaining position now, both to not use violence, but if necessarily use violence."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "Because otherwise, Russia is going to be extremely powerful in the future and they'll be able to use that power to change the

hand over something that makes us powerful because that's the bargain that would make us all better off."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "And the reason political economists call it a commitment problem is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And they can't make that commitment because there's nobody who will hold them accountable."}, {"time": 7070,

solution."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "All right, if that's the core problem."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "And so that's why, you know, in Medellin, you know, the oficina can do that."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "They can say, listen, yes, combo that's strong today is gonna be weak tomorrow."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "You have an incentive to eliminate this combo over here, because they're gonna be strong."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "And we're gonna make sure, we're gonna promise that when these guys do get strong, we're gonna restrain what they can do."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "Most of our constitutions in most stable countries have done precisely that, right?"}, {"time": 7116, "text": "There's a lot of complaining right now in the United States about the way that the Constitution is apportioned power between states."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That was a deal."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That was a commitment."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "The Constitution in the United States was a deal made to a bunch of states that knew they were going to be weak in future because of economic and demographic trends, or guess they might be."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And it said, listen, you cooperate and we'll commit not to basically ignore your interests over the long run."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And now, you know, 250 years later, we're still honoring those commitments."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "It was part of the deal that meant that there actually would be a union."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "And so we do this all the time."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "So a constitution is a good example of how every country's constitution, especially a country who's writing a constitution after a war, that constitution and all of the other institutions they're building are an attempt to like provide commitment to groups who are worried about future shifts in power."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "And does that help with avoid civil war?"}, {"time": 7182, "text": "So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars, perhaps the American Civil War or any others?"}, {"time": 7192, "text": "So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried for a long time to preserve the interests of minority groups, powerful minority groups who were powerful at the time and knew that the demographics were working against them, was to guarantee, you know, this ethnic religious group gets the presidency and this ethno religious group gets the prime ministership and this ethno."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And a lot of countries will apportion seats in the parliament to ethno religious groups."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And that's an attempt to like give a group that's temporarily powerful some assurances that when they're weak in the future that they'll still have a say, right?"}, {"time": 7240, "text": "Just like we apportioned seats in the Senate in a way that's not demographically representative but is like unequal, quote unquote, in a sense to help people be confident that there won't be a tyranny of the majority."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "And now that just happens to have been like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon because eventually like the de facto power on the ground just gets so out of line with this really rigid system of the presidency goes to this ethno religious group and this prime ministership goes, that it didn't last, right?"}, {"time": 7269, "text": "But you can think of every post conflict agreement and every constitution is like a little bit of humans best effort to find an agreement that's going to protect the interests of a group that temporarily has an interest in violence in order to not be violent."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And so there's a lot of ingenuity and it doesn't always work, right?"}, {"time": 7300, "text": "Which actually from a perspective of the group, threatening violence or actually doing violence is one way to make progress for your group."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?"}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine or Russians versus the West or maybe it's managing games versus one another."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "Like a lot of their bargaining power comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?"}, {"time": 7317, "text": "And so if I want to have more bargaining power, I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "And so the strategically wise thing to do, I mean, it's terrible, it's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into, but the strategically wise thing to do is to build up lots of arms to threaten to use them, to credibly threaten to use them."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "But then trust or hope that like your enemy is going to see reason and avoid this really terrible, inefficient thing, which is fighting."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "But the thing that's going on the whole time is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "That's the tragedy."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "We don't have war and that's good, but we have really limited abilities to like incentivize our enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves from arming."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "And so the mess is that we have to arm and then we have to threaten all the time."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "You've actually pulled up that now disappeared

scientists obviously had been studying this for a long time, who started bringing economic tools and expertise and partnerships with political scientists and adding to it."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so we wrote this."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "So after like people have been doing this for five or 10 years in our field, we wrote like a review article telling economists like what was going on."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so this was like a summary for economists."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So the book in some ways is a lot in the same spirit of this article."}, {"time": 7495, "text":

we know?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "And what do we know about building peace?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "Because if you don't know what the reason for wars are, you're probably not going to design the

10 or 15 years of pretty serious violence in that span of time."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "Most of it from 2000 to 2009 and stretching up to like 2014."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "There are like sporadic incidents, which are really terrible."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "I'm not trying to diminish the human cost of these, by the way."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "I'm just trying to point out that whatever's happening, as unpleasant and challenging and difficult as it is, is actually not war."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "And so it is at peace."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "There's sort of an uneasy stalemate."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "The Israelis and Palestinians are actually pretty good at just sort of keeping this at a relatively low scale of violence."}, {"time": 7648, "text": "There's a whole bunch of like low scale sporadic violence that can be repression of civilians, it can be terror bombings and terror actions, it can be counter terror violence, it can be mass arrests, it can be repression, it can be denying people the vote, it can be rattling sabers, all these things that are happening, right?"}, {"time": 7671, "text": "And it can be sporadic three week wars or sporadic, you know, very brief episodes of intense violence before everybody sees sense and then settles down to this uneasy."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "We're right not to think of that as like a peace and there's certainly no stable agreement, right?"}, {"time": 7690, "text": "So a stable agreement and amity and any ability to move on from this extreme hostility, we're not there yet and that's maybe very far away."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "But this is a good example of two rivals who most of the time have avoided really intense violence."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So you talked about this, like most of the time, rivals just like avoiding violence and hating each other in peace."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So is this what peace, to answer my question, is this what peace looks like?"}, {"time": 7726, "text": "Not always, but I mean, it's kind of my worry."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "To go back to like the Russia Ukraine example, like I kind of, it's really hard, it's gonna be really hard to find an agreement that both sides can feel they can honor, that they can be explicit about, that they'll hold to, that will enable them to move on."}, {"time": 7745, "text": "Yeah, feels like a first step in a long journey towards a greatness for both nations and a peaceful time, flourishing, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "I mean, you can think of like what's going on in Israel, Palestine, there's a stalemate."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "Both of them are exhausted from the violence that has occurred."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "Neither one of them is quite willing to, for various reasons,

same situation with Russia, Ukraine."}, {"time": 7771, "text": "This is where, you know, if they stop fighting one another, but Russia holds the east of the country and Crimea and nobody really acknowledges their right to that, that might, within there's just gonna be a lot of tension and skirmishing and violence, but that never really progresses to war for 30 years."}, {"time": 7790,

talk about why we fight, then the question we have to ask is like why, you know, like the Second Intifada, like that was the most violent episode."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "Like why did that happen and why did that last several years?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "That would be like, we could analyze that and we could say, what was it about these periods of violence that led there to be prolonged intense violence?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "Because that was in nobody's interest."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "That didn't need to happen."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "And partly I don't talk about that in the book."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "I wanted to avoid really contemporary conflicts for two reasons."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "One is I, things could change really quickly."}, {"time": 7829,

to be enduring and meant partly just avoiding changing things and changing these and avoiding these controversial ones."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "But I, of course I think about them."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "And so like a lot of my time, I decided actually last year to teach a class where I'd take all these contemporary conflicts I wasn't working on the book and where I wasn't really an expert, whether it's India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Israel, Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars and a few others."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And then teach a class on them with students and we'd work through it."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "We'd read the book and then we'd say, all right, none of us are experts."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "How do we make sense of these places?"}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And we focused in the Israel Palestine case of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent and spend a little bit of time on what the prospects are for something that's more enduring."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "It's hard to know that stuff now."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "I mean, it's easier to do the full analysis when looking back when it's over."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "Well, Israel is in like a tough place."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "They have this attachment to being part of the West."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "They have this attachment to liberal

state."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And to do anything else and to deny that denies their liberal democratic ideals."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And that's a really hard contest of priorities to sort out."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "Of course, everything you just said probably has multiple perspectives on it from other people that would phrase all the same things, but using different words."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "Well, I try to analyze these things in like a dispassionate way."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "But unfortunately, just having enough conversations, even your dispassionate description would be seen as one that's already picked aside."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "And I'll say this because there's holding these ideals."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "The United States also has ideals of freedom and other like human rights."}, {"time": 7999, "text": "So it has those ideals, and it also sees itself as a superpower and as a deployer of those, enforcer of those ideas in the world."}, {"time": 7999, "text": "And so the kind of actions from a perspective of a lot of people in that world, from children, they get to see drones, drop bombs on their house where their father is now, mother dead."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "They have a very different view of this."}, {"time": 8025, "text": "You're beginning to see why I didn't."}, {"time": 8025, "text": "I wanted to write about those things and think about those things, but I wanted this book to do something different."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "I didn't want it to fall on one of these polarizing...

history, by the way."}, {"time": 8064, "text": "History is just full of raw deals."}, {"time": 8067, "text": "For regular people."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "And both sides are, in a principled way,

more checks and balances on power."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "I think there's more, but those are two that are really fundamental here because I think those two things reduce the incentives for war in two ways."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "One is, remember when we were talking about this really simple strategic game where whether I'm Russia or Ukraine or whatever, any two rivals, I want more of the pie than you get, and the costs of war are deterrents, but only the costs of war that I feel, right?"}, {"time": 8172, "text": "I do not care about the costs of war to your side, my rival side."},

"text": "Now, in reality, many groups do care about the well being of the other group, at least a little bit, right?"}, {"time": 8187, "text": "In some sense, to the degree we, first of all, if our interests are intertwined, like our economies are intertwined, that's not a surefire way for peace, and we shouldn't get complacent because we have a globally integrated world, but that's going to be a disincentive."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And if we're socially entwined because we have great social relationships and linkages and family or we're intermarriage or whatever, all these things will help."}, {"time": 8213, "text": "And then if we're ideologically intertwined, maybe we share notions of liberty or maybe we just share a common notion of humanity."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "So, I think the fact that we're more integrated than we've ever been on all three fronts in the world but with China is providing some insulation, which is good."}, {"time": 8230, "text": "So, I would be more worried if we started to shed some of that insulation, which I think has been happening a little bit."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "U.S. economic nationalism, whatever could be the fallout of these sanctions or a closer Chinese alliance with Russia, all those things could happen."}, {"time": 8248, "text": "Those would make me more worried because I think we've got a lot of cushion that comes from all of this economic, social, cultural interdependence."}, {"time": 8256, "text": "The social one with the Internet is a big one."}, {"time": 8256, "text": "So, basically, make friends with the people from different nations, fall in love."}, {"time": 8265, "text": "You don't have to fall in love."}, {"time": 8265, "text": "You can just have lots of sex with people from different nations, but also fall in love."}, {"time": 8271, "text": "The thing that also should comfort me about China is that China is not as centralized or as personalized a regime as Russia, for example."}, {"time": 8280, "text": "And neither one of them is as centralized or personalized as some tinpot, purely personalized dictatorship like you get in some countries."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "The fact that China, the power is much more widely shared is a big insulation, I think, against this war, well, future war."}, {"time": 8298, "text": "The attempts by Xi Jinping to personalize power over time and to make China a more centralized and personal ruled place, which he's successfully moved in that direction, also worries me."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "So, anything that moves China in the other direction, not necessarily being democratic, but just like a wider and wider group of people holding power, like all of the business leaders and all the things that have been happening over the last few centuries have actually widened power."}, {"time": 8329, "text": "But anything that's moving in the other direction does worry me because it's going to accentuate all these five risks."}, {"time": 8335, "text": "I am worried about a little bit of the demonization."}, {"time": 8335, "text": "So, one of the things I see with China as a problem for Americans, maybe I'm projecting, maybe it's just my own problem, but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap than there is with other superpowers throughout history where it's almost like this own world happening in China, its own world in the United States, and there's this gap of total cultural understanding."}, {"time": 8359, "text": "We're not competing superpowers."}, {"time": 8359, "text": "They're almost like doing their own thing."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "There's that feeling, and I think that means there's a lack of understanding of culture of people, and we need to kind of bridge that understanding."}, {"time": 8377,

to compete, you know, like Rocky, where Rocky Balboa fought the Russian."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "In fact, historically inaccurate because obviously the Russians win."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "But, you know, we have to, I'm just kidding, as a Philly person, I was of course rooting for Rocky."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "But the thing is, those two superpowers are in the movies."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "China is like its own out there thing."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "We need more Rocky 7."}, {"time": 8413, "text": "I do think there's a certain inscrutability to the politics there and an insularity to the politics such that it's harder for Westerners, even if they know, even just to learn about it and understand what's going on."}, {"time": 8424, "text": "I think that's a problem and vice versa."}, {"time": 8424, "text": "But at the same time, we could point to all sorts of things on the other side of the ledger, like the massive amounts of Chinese immigration into the United States and the massive number of people who are now."}, {"time": 8440, "text": "Like how many, so many more Americans, business people, politicians understand so much more about China now than they did 34 years ago because we're so intertwined."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "So I don't know where it balances out."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "I think it balances out on better understanding than ever before."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "But you're right, there was like a big gulf there that we haven't totally bridged."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "And like I said, lots of inter Chinese in the United States, sexual intercourse, no, and love and marriage and all that kind of social cohesion."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "So once again, returning to love, I read in your acknowledgement, and as you mentioned earlier, the acknowledgement reads, quote, I dedicate this book to a slow and all defunct internet cafe in Nairobi, because it set me on the path to meet, work with, and most importantly, marry Jenny Annan."}, {"time": 8498, "text": "Jenny Annan."}, {"time": 8498, "text": "There's a lot of beautiful letters in this beautiful name."}, {"time": 8498, "text": "This book have been

that internet cafe, I think it was 2004."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "I didn't know what I wanted to do."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "I was a good development economist and I cared about growth, economic growth, and I thought industrialization is like the solution to poverty in Africa, which I think is still true."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "And therefore I need to go study firms and industry in Africa."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "And so I went and one of the most dynamic place for firms and industry at the time, still to some extent now was Kenya, and all these firms are on Nairobi."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "And so I went and I got a job with the World Bank, they were running a firm survey and I convinced them to let me help run the firm survey."}, {"time": 8557, "text": "And so now I'm in Nairobi and I'm wearing my suit and with the World Bank for the summer and my laptop gets stolen by two enterprising con artists, very charming."}, {"time": 8557, "text": "And so I find myself in an internet cafe."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "With no laptop."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "In a suit."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "Kenya didn't get connected to the big internet cables until maybe 10 years later."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "And so it was just glacially slow."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "So it would take 10 minutes for every email to load."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "And so there's this whole customer norm if you just chat to the next person beside you all the time."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "It was true all over anywhere I'd worked on the continent."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "And so I strategically sat next to the attractive looking woman when I came in and it turned out she was a psychologist and a PhD student, but she was a humanitarian worker."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "And she'd been working in South Sudan and Northern Uganda and this kids affected by this war."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "All these kids who were being conscripted were coming back because they're all running away after a day or 10 years and needed help or to get back into school."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "So she was working on things like that."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "And I think she talked to me in spite of the fact that I was wearing a suit, maybe because I knew a little bit about the war, which most people didn't."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "Most people were totally ignorant."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "And then we had a fling for that week."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "And then we didn't really, actually then we met up a little short while later."}, {"time": 8635,

was chatting with someone I knew who worked on this, a young professor who was a friend of mine."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "And I said, oh, you know, you work on similar issues, you should meet this woman."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "And I talked to her because you guys would have like, you know, professional research interests overlap."}, {"time": 8666, "text": "There's so few sort of people looking at armed groups in African Civil Wars, at least at the time."}, {"time": 8666, "text": "And he said, wow, that's a fascinating research question."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "And I walked into the building and I thought, that is a fascinating research question."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "And I phoned Jeanie and I said, remember me and, you know, tell me more."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "I was just talking to someone about this."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "And like, I started asking her more questions about it."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "We ended up talking for two or three hours."},

kids who were born like 20 or 30 years ago in the region, and we were going to track a thousand of them down."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "We were going to randomly sample them and then we were going to find them today and we were going to track them."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "And then we were going to use like some variation and exposure to violence and where the rebel group was to actually like show what happens to people when they're exposed to violence and conscription."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "We were going to like tell, you know, psychologically, economically, we're going to like answer questions and that, which would help you design better programs."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "And so we hatched this plan, which is totally cockamamie."}, {"time": 8735, "text": "It's so cockamamie that when I pulled my previous dissertation proposal from my committee, like the next week and gave them a new one, they unanimously met without me to decide that this was totally bonkers

8776, "text": "Like my day to day research job is not writing books about why we fight."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "My thing is like, I go, I collect data on things that nobody else thought you could collect data on."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "And so I always do pull it off, but it never turns out like I thought it was going to."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "Like it's always, there's so many twists and turns and always goes sideways in an interesting way."}, {"time": 8796, "text": "It works, but it's all, but this one actually we pulled off in spite of ourselves and as planned."}, {"time": 8796,

Sandra, whatever these people are."}, {"time": 8829, "text": "And they have this relationship in these intense circumstances and they like, well, and I think at the end of the movie, they are sort of

the story."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Because people should know that children are dying of starvation right now as we sit here."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And that that doesn't have to happen."},

within a 10 year old girl who's starving."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And so you asked what changed me."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "That's one moment, right?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "Rather than being

didn't think that's what this content would do, but it's what it did."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity we all have as human beings, right?"}, {"time":

watch and no language is needed, right, to bear witness to this."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And she also suffers because of that, right?"}, {"time": 2006, "text": "And so near the end of the film, if

the room."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "The whole film, right?"}, {"time": 3639, "text": "We had a field producer as well in this part of the country, but in terms of camera, it's just two people and we're doing everything."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "And we have lenses that are long enough that we don't have to move to camera."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "We don't have to move to capture the film."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?"}, {"time": 3656, "text": "And so just what's long mean?"}, {"time": 3658, "text": "That means they're standing farther away and they can look."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "So it's not a fixed focal length, right?"}, {"time": 3664, "text": "Because a fixed focal length, you have to move a lot more in order to capture action."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end, I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away instead of having to get right up on someone, right?"}, {"time": 3678, "text": "So you're less likely to interrupt the scene and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "So I'm very intentional about that piece of it so that we can capture those vulnerable moments and not interrupt them."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "That's really fascinating too, because the access, I don't often think about this, but that's probably true for me as well."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "Part of the storytelling is to be in the room."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "And that's the hard part."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "Actually, as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film and 50 Feet From Syria, the getting there piece of it for the last two was much harder."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "Yeah, and it's also, it's a creative act."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "It's, I don't know if it is for you, but it's the kind of people you talk to."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "It's like how you live your life."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "Like the kind of people I talk to right now, they steer the direction of my life and steer the direction of things I'll film."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "So it's not just like you're trying to get access."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "It's like, it's everything."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "It builds, it builds and builds and builds and builds."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "It builds on itself, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "I mean, part of the thing, even saying, talking about some of these leaders and conversations with them, it's almost like steering your life into the direction of the difficult, of like taking the leap."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And if you're a good human being and a lot of people know who you are as a human, like not as a name, but as really who you are, that like putting that attention out there, it's somehow the world opens doors where the access becomes, the access that once seemed impossible becomes possible."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And then all of that is a creative journey to be in the room."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "I think that probably is, I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably, is like everything that led to that, like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room and to shoot the scene is maybe more important than the scene itself."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "And like really focus on the creative act of that."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "Yeah, that's really fascinating."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "And especially, I mean, with a documentary, you get one take."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "Yeah, you can't say, hey, reset, right?"}, {"time": 3831, "text": "Ah, that is so interesting."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "As you were in some of the most difficult parts of the world in the room with some of the most difficult stories to be told."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "Because once you have that lived experience for me, it's moving."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "It moves me to bear witness to these inspiring people under difficult circumstances."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And I can't come back to the US afterwards and walk down the grocery aisle where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?"},

have a choice about what to do with that privilege, right?"}, {"time": 3894, "text": "And the last thing I wanna do is start doing stories about dandelions, right?"}, {"time": 3901, "text": "There's far more important things to do on this very limited time that I have on the planet."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "And I think that's catalytic for me."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Like I feel that mortality each day."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "And my goal is to tell as many of these stories before I'm gone."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "Could you speak to the getting access?"}, {"time": 3931,

adventure."}, {"time": 3946, "text": "And it's definitely an adventure."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "It's an adventure."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "Everyone's an adventure, yeah."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had in the recent past was for 50 Feet from Syria where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And after many months of trying to get an appointment with an orthopedic hand surgeon, a specialist, I finally did and he was Syrian American."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "And the Syrian conflict had just begun and we just started talking about it."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And after he looked at my hand in the first five minutes, he's like, yeah, you need surgery, great."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "But then somehow we started talking about Syria and like five minutes in, he just stood up and like put the privacy curtain around us, supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "And we talked for an hour, right?"}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So, you know, those moments of sort of mysterious confluence happen, right?"}, {"time": 4000, "text": "And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well, right?"}, {"time": 4006, "text": "So, because he then contacted me later and said, Skye, I am going back to the Syrian border to volunteer as a surgeon, do you want to come with me?"}, {"time": 4016, "text": "That was an easy one."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "That's probably the easiest one I could give you."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "But it came out of this interesting moment, very personal moment, right?"}, {"time": 4022, "text": "Lifeboat and Hunger Ward are completely different."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "And I had to really work hard to gain access to those stories."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "So you intentionally thought like what, I want to get access to the story."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "And then what are the different ideas?"}, {"time": 4040, "text": "And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open to experiences that lead you into the room."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "So it's funny you mentioned the doctor because I have similar experiences now."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people in the same way."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "They're all around us."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "You just have to look."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "It's like there's fascinating people everywhere who are doing

through life."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "You meet people, you share a beer or a drink or just you fall in love or you share trauma together."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "You go through a hard time together."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "And those little sticky things connects us humans."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And if you just keep yourself open and embrace the curiosity."}, {"time": 4107,

4149, "text": "And I think that is illustrative of sort of how my career has been."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "I just keep going."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "And I believe in this notion of incremental evolution that with each project, I try to learn from it and take away lessons learned and improve my craft, right?"}, {"time": 4168, "text": "And improve how I leverage that craft and improve how I tell the story from a narrative standpoint each time."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "So that on the next project, it's a little bit better."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "And that's the arc of my career is

there's a line between journalists and documentary filmmakers."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "Nobody really trusts journalists."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "But a documentary filmmaker, of course I'm joking, half joking."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "I don't know which percentage joking, but some truth."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller, an artist, and

gain the trust of people to gain access?"}, {"time": 4229, "text": "Are you just trying to be a good human being?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "Is there something to be said there?"}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Well, so I do draw a distinction between journalism and filmmaking because I think you're right, they're different."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "And there are some filmmakers who do hue to sort

right?"}, {"time": 4285, "text": "I think in anything we do, whether it's like to seek truth or some larger principle, I always have an agenda."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "I chose to work with civilians and caretakers in Yemen on Hunger Ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?"}, {"time": 4305, "text": "That's what I'm interested in is bringing that to the world, right?"}, {"time": 4310, "text": "But in terms of building relationships and trust, it's really, I think about transparency as much as anything else and going in in a collaborative sense."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "So I don't think of the people that I film with as subjects, for example."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "I think of them as collaborators."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "And it's based on relationships, right?"}, {"time": 4339, "text": "You have to build relationships with other human beings, however you can, and that takes time and it takes listening and it's active."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "So I've talked about the notion of consent before, which is so important in nonfiction film."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "And I hew to this idea that you don't just slide a piece of paper in front of someone, have release form and have them sign it, right?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "That's not the nature of true consent in my mind."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "It's you have to work on a foundation of active consent every single day that you're working with someone."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And that's based on relationship, right?"}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And it's based on dialogue."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "So it's trust that I'm always aiming for."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "It's the building of relationships, which I'm always aiming for, which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos from Dr. Al Sadiq in the South of Yemen."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "And she sends me photos all the time of the children that she's currently treating because we have an active relationship that's continues on and probably will for many years to come."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "So it's going to continue."}, {"time": 4408,

picture stories, cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?"}, {"time": 4426, "text": "You mentioned director of photography."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "What's your, how much do you love the feel, the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?"}, {"time": 4436, "text": "You know, there's some people, they're just like, ah, they love lenses."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "How much do you love that or versus how much do you focus on the story or the access and all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 4449, "text": "I'm not a tech geek, but because during the bulk of my career, I've worked as a director of photography myself for other people in order to pay the bills over the years, you know, I know the technical side of it because I've had to know it and I've had to train myself and learn it."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So I see them as necessary tools."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And again, because I believe, you know, film and cinema is and should be visually driven and not verbally driven."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "I want the best tools possible within my means, right?"}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And within the logistical ability of the project because we have to go so small, right?"}, {"time": 4496, "text": "I can't afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "So if I gave you a trillion dollars."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "A trillion dollars?"},

you're not allowed to do any of that."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn't invest in it."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Well, I guess I would invest in current."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "I would increase capacity to do more films."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "What I would do."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "So I would buy basically the perfect little, you know, mini equipment set, right?"}, {"time": 4540, "text": "But then I would train three teams maybe to do the same thing that I've been doing so we could multiply and scale up."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "More and more stories."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "Yeah, that's what I would do with the money."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "But the actual setup."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Would remain small and nimble."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And what about lighting?"}, {"time": 4559, "text": "Do you usually use natural light?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Do you ever do?"}, {"time": 4564, "text": "I mean, sorry for the technical questions here, but highlighting the drama of the human face."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "That's the visual."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "That's art."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "That's like, to reveal reality at its deepest is art."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And do you use lighting?"}, {"time": 4584, "text": "Lighting's such a big part of that."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "Do you ever do artificial lighting?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "Do you try to do natural always?"}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You know the best lighting instrument in the world?"}, {"time": 4593, "text": "Is the sun."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "At the right moment of the day."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "And so I predominantly use natural light at certain moments and just shape natural light during the course of these small human rights stocks."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes, but when we do, they're very small and again, compact."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So for example, I have this small little tube kit that's just three instruments, right?"}, {"time": 4627, "text": "That you can charge with USB."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "Because electricity is often a major issue where we go."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "So there's just three little tube lights with magnetic backs that if we find in a situation where, you know, we can't get enough exposure for a hallway or something, and we have the time to throw it up, we'll throw it up if people are walking, if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot, for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?"}, {"time": 4649, "text": "So it's instances like that."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often, but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?"}, {"time": 4660, "text": "And always bring a reflector or two, you know, just to shape natural light as well in ways."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "Got it, as we sit surrounded by black curtains in complete natural light."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "So just so you know, this room is like a violation of the basic principles of using the sun."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "So behind the large curtains are giant windows."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So this whole."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "Should I rip them open?"}, {"time": 4695, "text": "Should I rip open the curtains real quick?"}, {"time": 4699, "text": "How much of the work is done in the edit?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "That's another question I'm curious about."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "And how much do you sort of anticipate that?"}, {"time": 4708, "text": "Like when you're actually shooting, are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen or are you just collecting, as a human, collecting little bits of story here and there and in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?"}, {"time": 4726, "text": "I've developed this sort of mental paradigm for myself over the years that speaks to that."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And I call it the three creations, right?"}, {"time": 4736, "text": "And so when I'm doing a film, the first creation for me is my preconception or visualization of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?"}, {"time": 4749, "text": "So I have this entire vision of what a film's gonna be."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "And sometimes it can be pretty specific."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "Like I'll think through the scenes if I know the locations and everything, and I'll have this idea of what I'm gonna create, right?"}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And then I'm there filming, right?"}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And always without fail, reality is something altogether different than what I thought it would be."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "But it's still good to have the original idea."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision, right, and to create a film out of that idea, they'd be crap, all the films would be crap."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach and then embrace what is actually occurring with the people actually doing it and then reenvision."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "So that reenvision is very active during the entire filming process."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "And so that's the second creation, that's the rethinking and revisualizing based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing what this film is going to be."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "And then I finished filming, right?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And we bring the hard drives back and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?"}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And then just transferring the footage and getting on safely, you know, clone to multiple drives."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "I don't have a chance to review everything."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "So because I'm filming half of it, I know what I've filmed, right?"}, {"time": 4840, "text": "But I haven't seen everything the director of photography has filmed, right?"}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame of what's been filmed."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?"}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Or the second time rather is, wow, now I thought we'd filmed this, but actually there's this over here."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "And then I have to open up this second vision and turn it and transform it into a third vision for the film based on what's actually on the hard drive."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "So is this like a daily process?"}, {"time": 4875, "text": "So what I do, my process is that if it's a really difficult project, I'll take a break before I go through this just for healing, you know, and some space away and fresh eyes."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "And usually that's about a month."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog, I reengage fully and I review every single frame."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was, I don't know, 1500 lines long or something where it's basically log notes."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "And I watch every scene and I take notes and I know really what we have."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "And once I've gone through that process that takes about a month and I really know what we came back with, I create an outline for the film from that."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "And that's the third visioning, right?"}, {"time": 4925, "text": "That's usually completely different than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?"}, {"time": 4930, "text": "But I have to stay open to that entire process or I'd be trying to create something that I can't really create."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So I think those are the three creations for me."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "That's so cool to know what we have, just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "Cause like, this is the capture of reality we have."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "It's a very kind of scientific process too."}, {"time": 4957, "text":

an interesting little, so they say something to the camera that they consent or they sign the thing."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies have this formalized

questions, have them ask questions, come to a complete understanding before you even know whether they understand what you're asking, right?"}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And then in that case, if

Wiseman, according to his paradigm, then we should have just filmed."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "I had no sort of foreknowledge that I was gonna find myself faced with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "But there was no question in my mind that I had to put my camera down and pull that fellow human being out of the water."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "And I don't regret it at all."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "So I've come to a different place."}, {"time": 6286, "text":

different if I hadn't made that choice, I made the right choice as a human being."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "So I think of it as being a human being first and a filmmaker second in moments like that."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "That's beautifully put, but I also think you could be a human being in small ways too, like silly ways, and put a little bit of yourself in documentaries."}, {"time": 6320, "text": "I tend to see that as really beautiful."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "Like the meta piece of it?"}, {"time": 6326, "text": "Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is, is realize that there's a human behind the camera too."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer, that's enjoyable too."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "I think there's a real authenticity there behind the story, especially with these hard stories that you're doing that there's a human being struggling to."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Like observing the suffering and having to bear the burden that this kind of suffering exists in the world and you're behind that camera living that struggle."},

subtle moments where I allow that presence to live just for a second."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "Like I hate belly button docs, that's what I call them."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "What's a belly button doc?"}, {"time": 6388, "text": "A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?"}, {"time": 6390, "text": "Where it's sort of a narcissistic filmmaking where someone just studies their own place in the world."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "Right, I think."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "I think my, I'm more concerned with how I can intervene, right?"}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Yeah, well, you're trying to really deeply empathize."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "So like, if you do empathize, who am I?"}, {"time": 6415, "text": "I don't wanna center myself in these stories."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "It's not about me, right?"}, {"time": 6419, "text": "I am so unimportant."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "What is important is what's happening, what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon."}, {"time":

saying just to remind viewers that there's obviously a filmmaker at play."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "So sometimes the way that I do that is just like through a question on camera."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "I'd allow the audio to live of a question or during a conversation I'm having with someone so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?"}, {"time": 6454, "text": "And to me, that's enough."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "I do like moments when people recognize that you exist."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "They look at the filmmaker past the camera and yes, you ask the question in an interview or something like that and they respond to that."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "Like they respond to this like new perturbation into their reality that was created by this other human."},

something about them."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality of their life, you do that plus the perturbations of like something novel."}, {"time": 6504, "text":

extremely, I don't."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "It's a really moving idea."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "Just the fact that this exists in the world, that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality, that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "It's the desperation of it."}, {"time": 6561, "text": "And now with these refugees, the desperation of that, of trying to

to already tell?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "Can you tell me what is it about?"}, {"time": 6596, "text": "So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean when it was at its height in 2016."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "And it came to be for many reasons, but one of those reasons is colleagues in the NGO community really shared with me that when the borders between Greece and Turkey were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So I started to research that and discovered that was exactly the case, and then further stumbled upon the fact that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers often drowning in these flimsy crafts that were pushed off from the shores of Libya because the EU wasn't doing its duty to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And so the net result of that was that this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up and it was civil society based that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers to just ensure that fellow human beings weren't drowning, simply put."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch, which when they discovered what was happening, just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers, bought a research vessel, retrofitted it, and motored down off the coast of Libya to start pulling people out of the water."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And again, I found that inspiring, right?"}, {"time": 6708, "text": "I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers was doing something that our leaders wouldn't, right?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And it was something as basic and simple as saving human beings."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "And I thought there was an inspiring story there."}, {"time": 6726, "text": "And as it turned out, there was."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "Have you ever saved someone's life as part of making these documentaries directly?"}, {"time": 6737,

water who couldn't swim, I did that."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity, put down the camera and help, yeah."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "So this is people coming from Libya, trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea on a crappy, tiny boat."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?"}, {"time": 6771, "text": "Was there decisions to capture the desperation?"}, {"time": 6775, "text": "Well, we were going back to this idea of access and how that's so fundamental to my approach."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "And we were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation on this Sea Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "And we were two of a crew of 15, right?"}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So we had to multitask all the time because the only reason we were on that boat was by agreeing that if needed, we would do whatever necessary, right?"}, {"time": 6807, "text": "To help, right?"}, {"time": 6810, "text": "And so it was very active on multiple levels and we were making decisions each and every day that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions, but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?"}, {"time": 6833, "text": "Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "And the greatest example I can share of that was, or with my director of photography in that project, Kenny Allen, Kenny's a big guy."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "It's like, he's got like arms like tree trunks."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And he, because he was so physically able and strong, the head of mission really tasked him to be on the Zodiacs to pull people out of the water because he could literally with one arm reach down and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?"}, {"time": 6870, "text": "Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?"}, {"time": 6873, "text": "And so when we were at the height of triage and there were people in the water all over and rafts were sinking, Kenny was out pulling people out of the water."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "And this went on for like 24 hours, right?"}, {"time": 6886, "text": "And at the end of that first day, I remember like looking over on the deck and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders to walk them back, right?"}, {"time": 6896, "text": "And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?"}, {"time": 6899, "text": "And so I walked over to him and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said, Kenny, where's your camera?"}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And he didn't know."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "He had no idea where his camera was, right?"}, {"time": 6911, "text": "And so I just said, Kenny, we're here to do what you're doing, but we're also here to film it, right?"}, {"time": 6921, "text": "To make sure that we document what is unfolding in front of us so that we have a record of it, right?"}, {"time": 6928, "text": "So we can bring it to a larger audience."}, {"time": 6930, "text": "So you need to go find your camera so we can also document it."}, {"time": 6934, "text": "And that kind of pulled him out and he went and got his camera and started filming again, but that gives you a sense of sort of this world that we had to live in in order to get the story done."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "But I think to be a great director of photography, to be a great director, you have to lose yourself like that in the story too."}, {"time": 6953, "text": "But usually with a camera in your hand, right?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "But sometimes you forget the camera."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "I mean, there's a, I feel like if you're obsessed with the camera too much, you can lose the humanity of it."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "You get obsessed with the film and the story."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "It can become clinical."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "Yes, it can become clinical."}, {"time": 6972, "text": "Absolutely, and it's, you know, yeah, absolutely."}, {"time": 6975, "text": "And we don't wanna become, I don't wanna become clinical in my film, certainly."}, {"time": 6979, "text": "Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question."},

rules are a very hazy kind of concept."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "And a lot of them, especially, like, it's funny, but authoritarian regimes often have a giant bureaucracy buildup that's full of rules."}, {"time": 7060, "text": "There's more rules than you know what to deal with, and you can't actually live life unless you break the rules."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "Anyway, laying that all out on the table, do you ever contend with that, on what are the rules I can break or should break to keep to the spirit of the story?"}, {"time": 7080, "text": "I think you have to ask yourself, are the rules just, and why are they in place, right?"}, {"time": 7085, "text": "So, for example, coming into the airport in southern Yemen, right?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "If I just tried to walk through the airport with all my equipment, even with all the permissions beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer at the airport beforehand to make sure we didn't go through the standard line,

previously, I took a different path, right?"}, {"time": 7125, "text": "Where we hire a fixer beforehand to sort it out beforehand, right?"}, {"time": 7130, "text": "Rather than spending three hours of our time and paying a series of bribes, right?"}, {"time": 7134, "text": "Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand so that we can walk through a different line and have no one look at any of our equipment."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "That's a pretty good trade off in my mind."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "What about security when you're traveling in these places?"}, {"time": 7149, "text": "Do you ever have bodyguards?"}, {"time": 7152, "text": "Well, several questions around that."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Are you ever afraid for your life when you're filming in a war zone?"}, {"time":

can."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone is by having armed security with me."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And the reason for that is because, especially in a place like Yemen, right?"}, {"time": 7181, "text": "If you have armed security, you become a target in a way that if you're operating under sort of the auspices of international humanitarian law, I actually have more protection."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "So I don't bring security."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example, you're going to have someone from the de facto authorities with you anyway the entire time you're there."}, {"time": 7206, "text": "So the authorities are with you in form anyway."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "Regarding fear, yeah, of course."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?"}, {"time": 7220, "text": "And I think we have a weird mindset, this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US, which I don't pay tribute to."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "I believe as a natural human emotion, it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to."}, {"time": 7240, "text": "And I think rather than pretending to be brave, I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place to keep you alive."}, {"time": 7254, "text": "And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway."}, {"time": 7264, "text": "Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker, the fear is a really good signal for potentially a good thing to do because there's a story there?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "So is fear is an indicator that you shouldn't do it or is it an indicator that you should do it?"}, {"time": 7279, "text": "It's probably an indication you should do it, right?"}, {"time": 7282, "text": "And strangely, I think that's why, I think that if there's something unusual about the work I do in some part, it's because of these

would love to talk at least a little bit about this film."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "First, can you, high level, can you tell what this documentary is about?"}, {"time": 7385, "text": "Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising, and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon who was volunteering, operating on refugees as they float across the border from Syria into Turkey."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "And it was an attempt at the time, before a lot of films had come out about the conflict, to really show again the effects of the war on civilians."},

visited?"}, {"time": 7475, "text": "So in that instance, you know, I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?"}, {"time": 7481, "text": "Because he was a human being who of his own volition, no one was paying him to do this, but he was spending much of his time."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "He was just a local businessman who really saw the need in the camps right across the border 10 K away."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "And he saw the medical need in particular and how hard it was to get people in desperate medical conditions across the border where there was a clinic just right across the border."}, {"time": 7513, "text": "But because of the security and the layers of security, they couldn't get out by themselves."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person to build relationships with the Turkish guards, which was relatively easy."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "And then he built relationships with sort of the guards in the no man's land between the Syrian guards and sort of those who lived in the middle area."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "And he would drive out there daily and bring them food, right?"}, {"time": 7545, "text": "Talk them up and build relationships."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "And so every day he would bring these guards food and build relationships with them."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "And what that meant was eventually, right?"}, {"time": 7554, "text": "He had this avenue of access to and from the camps."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "And so he started using it and he would drive this avenue of access through the three layers of guards each day."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "And then they would open the gates for him because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes."}, {"time": 7573, "text": "And he would receive the most desperate medical cases that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?"}, {"time": 7581, "text": "To receive medical treatment."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "And he would, as you see in the film, he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?"}, {"time": 7588, "text": "And then drive them to the hospital where they would receive operations."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And then he would bring them back if they wanted after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria, if they wanted to return out post recovery."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "And he didn't get paid for that."}, {"time": 7604, "text": "He was spending his own money to do it because he saw other human beings in need."}, {"time":

those platforms are, I mean, they're not as easily accessible because you have to like, you have to use, you have to think and you have to chase a particular."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "You have to chase it, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "I guess from an economic standpoint, the answer to that is pretty clear, right?"}, {"time": 7819, "text": "It may not be what people want to
