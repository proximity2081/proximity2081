[{"title": "Jeff Atwood: Stack Overflow and Coding Horror | Lex Fridman Podcast #7", "id": "KZkYSSE8HHI", "quotes": [{"time": 286, "text": "There's a lot of examples of leaders that really mess this up, like they make decisions that are like, wow, it's a bad example for other people."}, {"time": 294, "text": "So I think leading by example is one."}, {"time": 297, "text": "The other one I believe is working really hard."}, {"time": 299, "text": "And I don't mean working exhaustively, but showing a real passion for the problem, not necessarily your solution to the problem, but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in."}, {"time": 311, "text": "Like with discourse, for example, the problem that we're looking at, which is my current project, is how do you get people in groups to communicate in a way that doesn't break down into the howling of wolves?"}, {"time": 321, "text": "How do you deal with trolling?"}, {"time": 323, "text": "Not like technical problems."}, {"time": 324, "text": "How do I get people to post paragraphs?"}, {"time": 326, "text": "How do I get people to use bold?"}, {"time": 327, "text": "How do I get people to use complete sentences, although those are problems as well?"}, {"time": 330, "text": "But how do I get people to get along with each other and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve, or reach some consensus on discussion, or just not hurt each other even?"}, {"time": 339, "text": "Maybe it's a discussion that doesn't really matter, but are people yelling at each other?"}, {"time": 344, "text": "Like that's not the purpose of this kind of communication."}, {"time": 346, "text": "So I would say leadership is about setting an example, doing the things that represent what you want to be, and making sure that you're actually doing those things."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And there's a trick to that too, because the things you don't do also say a lot about what you are."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Yeah, so let's pause on that one."}, {"time": 363, "text": "So those two things are fascinating."}, {"time": 365, "text": "So how do you have as a leader that self awareness?"}, {"time": 368, "text": "So you just said it's really hard to be self aware."}, {"time": 370, "text": "So for you personally, or maybe for other leaders you've seen or look up to, how do you know both that the things you're doing are the wrong things to be doing, the way you speak to others, the way you behave, and the things you're not doing?"}, {"time": 383, "text": "How do you get that signal?"}, {"time": 384, "text": "I think there's two aspects to that."}, {"time": 386, "text": "One is like processing feedback that you're getting, so."}, {"time": 389, "text": "How do you get feedback?"}, {"time": 390, "text": "Well, right, so are you getting feedback, right?"}, {"time": 392, "text": "So one way we do it, for example, with discourse, we have three cofounders, and we periodically talk about decisions before we make them."}, {"time": 398, "text": "So it's not like one person can make a mistake, or like, wow, there can be misunderstandings, things like that."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So it's part of like group consensus of leadership is like it's good to have, I think systems where there's one leader, and that leader has the rule of absolute law are just really dangerous in my experience."}, {"time": 413, "text": "For communities, for example, like if you have a community that's run by one person, that one person makes all the decisions, that person's gonna have a bad day."}, {"time": 419, "text": "Something could happen to that person, something, there's a lot of variables."}, {"time": 423, "text": "So like first, when you think about leadership, have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So giving each other feedback about the decisions that they're making."}, {"time": 432, "text": "And then when you do get feedback, I think there's that little voice in your head, right?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "Or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body."}, {"time": 439, "text": "I think that voice is really important."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do, most people want to do the right thing."}, {"time": 447, "text": "I do believe that."}, {"time": 448, "text": "I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that don't, but most people, they want other people to think of them as a good person."}, {"time": 454, "text": "And why wouldn't you, right?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Like, do you want people to despise you?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "I mean, that's just weird, right?"}, {"time": 458, "text": "So you have that little voice that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder sort of talking to you about like what you're doing, how you're doing, how does it make you feel to make these decisions, right?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "And I think having some attunement to that voice is important."}, {"time": 470, "text": "But you said that voice also for, I think this is a programmer situation too, where sometimes the devil on the shoulder is a little too loud."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So you're a little too self critical for a lot of developers, and especially when you have introverted personality."}, {"time": 485, "text": "How do you struggle with a self criticism or the criticism of others?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "So one of the things of leadership is to do something that's potentially unpopular or where people doubt you and you still go through with the decision."}, {"time": 498, "text": "So what's that balance like?"}, {"time": 501, "text": "I think you have to walk people through your decision making, right?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "Like you have to, this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Again, code language is just another kind of code."}, {"time": 507, "text": "It's like, here is the program by which I arrived at the conclusion that I'm gonna reach, right?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "It's one thing to say like, this is a decision, it's final, deal with it, right?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "That's not usually satisfying to people."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But if you say, look, we've been thinking about this problem for a while."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Here's some stuff that's happened."}, {"time": 522, "text": "Here's what we think is right."}, {"time": 523, "text": "Here's our goals."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Here's what we wanna achieve."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And we've looked at these options and we think this available options is the best option."}, {"time": 530, "text": "People will be like, oh, okay, right?"}, {"time": 532, "text": "Maybe I don't totally agree with you, but I can kind of see where you're coming from and I see it's not just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky, right?"}, {"time": 540, "text": "It's like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And their goals might be different than yours."}, {"time": 545, "text": "That's completely legit, right?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "But if you're making that clear, it's like, oh, well, the reason we don't agree is because we have totally different goals, right?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Like, how could we agree?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "It's not that you're a bad person."}, {"time": 554, "text": "It's that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at this problem."}, {"time": 558, "text": "And the other one you said is passion."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So, or hard work, sorry."}, {"time": 562, "text": "Well, those are tied together in my mind."}, {"time": 564, "text": "Let's say hard work and passion."}, {"time": 564, "text": "Like for me, like I just really love the problem discourse is setting out to solve because in a way it's like, there's a vision of the world where it all devolves into Facebook basically owning everything and every aspect of human communication, right?"}, {"time": 577, "text": "And this has always been kind of a scary world for me."}, {"time": 579, "text": "First, cause I don't, I think Facebook is really good at execution."}, {"time": 582, "text": "I got to compliment them."}, {"time": 583, "text": "They're very competent in terms of what they're doing, but Facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of Facebook cares about Facebook, really."}, {"time": 590, "text": "They don't really care about you and your problems."}, {"time": 593, "text": "What they care about is how big they can make Facebook, right?"}, {"time": 596, "text": "Is that you talking about the company or just the mechanism of how Facebook works?"}, {"time": 599, "text": "Kind of both really, right?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "Like, and the idea with discourse, the reason I'm so passionate about it is cause I believe every community should have the right to own themselves, right?"}, {"time": 607, "text": "Like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them."}, {"time": 610, "text": "That's their space where they can set the rules."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And if they don't like it, they can move to different hosting or, you know, whatever they need to happen can happen."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But like this idea of a company town where all human communication is implicitly owned by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And it's really disturbing too, cause Facebook is really smart."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Like I said, they're great at execution."}, {"time": 628, "text": "Buying in WhatsApp and buying Instagram were incredibly smart decisions."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And they also do this thing, I don't know if you know, but they have this VPN software that they give away for free on smartphones and it indirectly feeds all the data about the traffic back to Facebook."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So they can see what's actually getting popular through the VPNs, right?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "They have low level access to the network data because users have let them have that."}, {"time": 651, "text": "So let's take a small pause here."}, {"time": 654, "text": "First of all, discourse."}, {"time": 655, "text": "Can you talk about, can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "So there's Stack Overflow that you've built."}, {"time": 663, "text": "There's discourse."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So Stack Overflow is kind of like a Wiki, Wikipedia you talk about."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And it's a very specific scalpel, very focused."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So what is the purpose of discourse and maybe contrast that with Facebook?"}, {"time": 676, "text": "First of all, say, what is discourse?"}, {"time": 678, "text": "Start from the beginning."}, {"time": 679, "text": "Well, let me start from the very beginning."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So Stack Overflow is a very structured Wiki style Q and A for programmers, right?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "And that was the problem we first worked on."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And when we started, we thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and other things, but we quickly realized we were doing Q and A, which is a very narrow subset of human communication, right?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "Sorry, so when you started Stack Overflow, you thought you didn't even know the Q and A."}, {"time": 702, "text": "You didn't know it would be Q and A."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Well, we didn't know."}, {"time": 704, "text": "We had an idea of like, okay, these are things that we see working online."}, {"time": 706, "text": "We had a goal, right?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "Our goal was there was this site, Experts Exchange, with a very unfortunate name."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Thank you for killing that site."}, {"time": 713, "text": "Yeah, I know, right?"}, {"time": 714, "text": "Like a lot of people don't remember it anymore, which is great."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Like that's the measure of success when people don't remember the thing that you were trying to replace, then you've totally won."}, {"time": 722, "text": "So it was a place to get answers to programming questions, but it wasn't clear if it was like focused Q and A, if it was a discussion."}, {"time": 728, "text": "There were plenty of programming forums."}, {"time": 730, "text": "So we weren't really sure."}, {"time": 731, "text": "We were like, okay, we'll take aspects of dig and Reddit, like voting were very important."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Reordering answers based on votes."}, {"time": 737, "text": "Wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts, not just your posts, but other people's posts to make them better and keep them more up to date."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Ownership of blogging of like, okay, this is me."}, {"time": 746, "text": "I'm saying this in my voice, this is the stuff that I know."}, {"time": 749, "text": "And your reputation accrues to you and it's peer recognition."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So you asked earlier, like what motivates programmers?"}, {"time": 757, "text": "I think peer recognition motivates them a lot."}, {"time": 760, "text": "That was one of the key insights of Stack Overflow was like recognition from your peers is why things get done."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Not necessarily money, not necessarily your boss, but like your peers saying, wow, this person really knows their stuff, has a lot of value."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So the reputation system came from that."}, {"time": 773, "text": "So we were sort of Frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in Stack Overflow, like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked and that became Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Over time, we realized it wasn't really discussion."}, {"time": 786, "text": "It was very focused questions and answers."}, {"time": 788, "text": "There wasn't a lot of room on the page for let me talk about this tangential thing."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It was more like, okay, is it answering the question?"}, {"time": 794, "text": "Is it clarifying the question?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "Or could it be an alternative answer to the same question?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "Because there's usually more than one way to do it in programming, there's like say five to 10 ways."}, {"time": 802, "text": "And one of the patterns we got into early on with Stack Overflow was there were questions where there would be like hundreds of answers."}, {"time": 808, "text": "And we're like, wow, how can there be a programming question with 500, 200, 500 answers?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "And we looked at those and we realized those were not really questions in the traditional sense."}, {"time": 818, "text": "They were discussions."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasn't allowed such as what's your favorite programming food?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "What's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like, why isn't this allowed?"}, {"time": 833, "text": "Such as, is this a real problem you're facing?"}, {"time": 835, "text": "Like nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can't work cause I don't know what the funniest programming cartoon is."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So sorry, can't compile this code now, right?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "It's not a real problem you're facing in your job."}, {"time": 844, "text": "So that was run rule."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And the second, like, what can you really learn from that?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "It's like what I call accidental learning or Reddit style learning."}, {"time": 850, "text": "Where you're just like, oh, I'll just browse some things and oh, wow, you know, did you know tree frogs only live three years?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "I mean, I just made that up."}, {"time": 856, "text": "I don't know if that's true."}, {"time": 856, "text": "But I didn't really set out to learn that."}, {"time": 858, "text": "I don't need to know that, right?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "It's accidental learning."}, {"time": 861, "text": "It was more intentional learning where you're like, okay, I have a problem."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And I want to learn about stuff around this problem having, right?"}, {"time": 867, "text": "And it could be theory, it could be compiler theory, it could be other stuff, but I'm having a compiler problem."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Hence, I need to know the compiler theory, that aspect of it that gets me to my answer, right?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "So kind of a directed learning."}, {"time": 879, "text": "So we had to backfill all these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And the system came very strict over time."}, {"time": 885, "text": "And a lot of people still complain about that."}, {"time": 886, "text": "And I wrote my latest blog entry, what does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "Celebrating the 10 year anniversary, yeah."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Yeah, so 10 years."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And the system has trended towards strictness."}, {"time": 897, "text": "There's a variety of reasons for this."}, {"time": 898, "text": "One is people don't like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous, which I can actually understand."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in code, it's like, well, why do they have that reputation?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "Is it because they wrote the joke?"}, {"time": 915, "text": "I mean, if they did, maybe, or the cartoon, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "They're getting a bunch of reputation based on someone else's work that's not even programming."}, {"time": 922, "text": "It's just a joke, right?"}, {"time": 923, "text": "It's related to programming."}, {"time": 924, "text": "So you begin to resent that."}, {"time": 926, "text": "You're like, well, that's not fair."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And it isn't."}, {"time": 928, "text": "At some level, they're correct."}, {"time": 929, "text": "I mean, I empathize."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Because it's not correct to get reputation for that."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Versus here's a really gnarly regular expression problem."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And here's a really clever, insightful, detailed answer laying out, oh, here's why you're seeing the behavior that you're seeing."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Here, let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future."}, {"time": 945, "text": "That's gold, right?"}, {"time": 946, "text": "You want people to get reputation for that, not so much for, wow, look at this funny thing I saw, right?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "So there's this very specific Q&A format."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And then take me through the journey towards discourse and Facebook and Twitter."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So you started at the beginning that Stack Overflow evolved to have a purpose."}, {"time": 962, "text": "So what is discourse, this passion you have for creating community for discussion?"}, {"time": 970, "text": "When was that born and how?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "Well, part of it is based on the realization that Stack Overflow is only good for very specific subjects where it's based on data, facts, and science, where answers can be kind of verified to be true."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Another form of that is there's the book of knowledge, like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is."}, {"time": 988, "text": "You can refer to that book and it'll give you the answer."}, {"time": 990, "text": "There has to be, it only works on subjects where there's like semi clear answers to things that can be verified in some form."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Now again, there's always more than one way to do it."}, {"time": 999, "text": "There's complete flexibility and system around that."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "But where it falls down is stuff like poker and LEGO."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Like we had, if you go to stackexchange.com, we have an engine that tries to launch different Q&A topics, right?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And people can propose Q&A topics, sample questions, and if it gets enough support within the network, we launched that Q&A site."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So some of the ones we launched were poker and LEGO and they did horribly, right?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Because I mean, they might still be there lingering on in some form, but it was an experiment."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "This is like a test, right?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And some subjects work super well on the stack engine and some don't."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "But the reason LEGO and poker don't work is because they're so social, really."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's not about what's the rule here in poker."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "It's like, well, what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "Or what's a cool set of cards to use when I'm playing poker?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Or what's some strategies?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Say I have this hand come up with some strategies I could use."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It's more of a discussion around what's happening with LEGO."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Same thing, here's this cool LEGO set I found."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Look how awesome this is."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And I'm like, yeah, that's freaking awesome, right?"}, {"time": 1058, "text": "It's not a question, right?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "There's all these social components and discussions that don't fit at all."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "We literally have to disallow those in Stack Overflow because it's not about being social."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's about problems that you're facing in your work that you need concrete answers for."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "You have a real demonstrated problem that's blocking you in something."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Nobody's blocked by, what should I do when I have a straight flush?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "It's not a blocking problem in the world."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "It's just an opportunity to hang out and discuss."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So discourse was a way to address that and say, look, discussion forum software was very, very bad."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And when I came out of Stack Overflow in early 2012, it was still very, very bad."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I expected it improved in the four years since I last looked, but it had not improved at all."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And I was like, well, that's kind of terrible because I love these communities of people talking about things that they love."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "They're just communities of interest, right?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And there's no good software for them."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Startups would come to me and say, hey, Jeff, I want to have this startup."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "Here's my idea."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And the first thing I would say to them is, well, first, why are you asking me?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "I don't really know your field necessarily."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Why aren't you asking the community, the people that are interested in this problem, the people that are using your product, why aren't you talking to them?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And then they'd say, oh, great idea."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "How do I do that?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And then that's when I started playing sad trombone because I realized all the software involving talking to your users, customers, audience, patrons, whatever it is, it was all really bad."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "It was stuff that I would be embarrassed to recommend to other people."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And yet, that's where I felt they could get the biggest and strongest, most effective input for what they should be doing with their product, right?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "It's from their users, from their community, right?"}, {"time": 1157, "text": "That's what we did on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So what we're talking about with forums, the, what is it, the dark matter of the internet, it's still, I don't know if it's still, but for the longest time, it has some of the most passionate and fascinating discussions."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And what's the usual structure?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "There's usually, it's linear, so it's sequential."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "So you're posting one after the other and there's pagination, so it's every, there's 10 posts and then you go to the next page."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And that format still is used by, like I'm, we're doing a lot of research with Tesla vehicles and there's a Tesla Motors Club forum, which is extremely."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "We really wanted to run that actually."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "They pinged us about it, I don't think we got it, but I really would have liked to gotten that one."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But they've started before even 2012, I believe."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I mean, they've been running for a long time."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's still an extremely rich source of information."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So what's broken about that system and how are you trying to fix it?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "I think there's a lot of power in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Meaning Facebook's idea of connection is just any human that's related to another human, right?"}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Like through friendship or any other reason."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "Facebook's idea of the world is sort of the status update, right?"}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Like a friend of yours did something, ate at a restaurant, right?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "Whereas discussion forums were traditionally around the interest graph."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Like I love electric cars, specifically I love Tesla, right?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Like I love the way they approach the problem."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "I love the style of the founder."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "I just love the design ethic."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And there's a lot to like about Tesla."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "I don't know if you saw the oatmeal, he did a whole love comic to Tesla."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And it was actually kind of cool because I learned some stuff."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "He was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically, like how they were built differently."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And he went into a lot of great detail that was really interesting."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And to me, that oatmeal post, if you read it, is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I just really love this stuff."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So like for me, for example, there's yo yos, right?"}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Like I'm into the yo yo communities."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And these interest communities are just really fascinating to me."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And I feel more connected to the yo yo communities than I do to friends that I don't see that often, right?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And Facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "I mean, they have groups, you can sign up for groups and stuff, but it's really about the relationship graph."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "Like this is my coworker, this is my relative, this is my friend, but not so much about the interest."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "So I think that's the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that I personally love."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Like I said, leadership is about passion, right?"}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And being passionate about stuff is a really valid way to look at the world."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And I think it's a way a lot of stuff in the world gets done."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "Like I once had someone describe me as, he's like, Jeff, you're a guy who, you just get super passionate about a few things at a time, and you just go super deep in those things."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And I was like, oh, that's kind of right."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "That's kind of what I do."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "I get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or whatever, and just learn all I can about it, and go super deep in it."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And that's how I enjoy experiencing the world, right?"}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Like not being shallow on a bunch of things, but being really deep on a few things that I'm interested in."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So forums kind of unlock that, right?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "And you don't want a world where everything belongs to Facebook, at least I don't."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves, set their own norms, set their own rules, control the experience."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "Because community is also about ownership, right?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Like if you're meeting at the Barnes and Noble every Thursday and Barnes and Noble says, get out of here, you guys don't buy enough books."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Well, you know, you're kind of hosed, right?"}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Barnes and Noble owns you, right?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "Like you can't."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "But if you have your own meeting space, you know, your own clubhouse, you can set your own rules, decide what you want to talk about there, and just really generate a lot better information than you could like hanging out at Barnes and Noble every Thursday at 3 p.m., right?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So that's kind of the vision of Discourse, is a place where it's fully open source."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "You can take the software, you can install it anywhere, and, you know, you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that you're into."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And this works for startups, right?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem, right?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And they want to talk to the community."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "It's like, well, install Discourse, right?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That's what we do at Discourse."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "That's what I did at Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "I spent a lot of time on Meta Stack Overflow, which is our internal, well, public community feedback site, and just experiencing what the users were experiencing, right, because they're the ones doing all the work in the system."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And they had a lot of interesting feedback."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And there's that 90, 10 rule of, like, 90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable for a variety of reasons."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "It might be bad feedback, it might be crazy feedback, it might be feedback you just can't act on right now."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "But there's 10% of it that's like gold."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "It's like literally gold and diamonds, where it's like feedback of really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to and actually make a lot of sense."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff I didn't even see coming."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "It's like, oh my God, I never even thought of that."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "But that's a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "And I can point to so many features of Stack Overflow that we derive from Meta Stack Overflow feedback and Meta discourse, right?"}, {"time": 1438, "text": "Same exact principle of discourse, you know?"}, {"time": 1441, "text": "We're getting ideas from the community."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I was like, oh my God, I never thought of that, but that's fantastic, right?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Like, I love that relationship with the community."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "From having built these communities, what have you learned about?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "What's the process of getting a critical mass of members in a community?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Is it luck, skill, timing, persistence?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "What is, is it the tools, like discourse, that empower that community?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "What's the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal and then building it to two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand and so on?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "I think when you're starting with an N of one, I mean, I think it's persistence and also you have to be interesting."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Like somebody I really admire once said something that I always liked about blogging."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "He's like, here's how you blog."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "You have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of saying it, right?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And then do that for like 10 years."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "So that's the genesis, is like you have to have sort of something interesting to say that's not exactly what everybody else is saying and an interesting way of saying it, which is another way of saying, kind of entertaining way of saying it."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And then as far as growing it, it's like ritual."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "You know, like you have to, like say you're starting a blog, you have to say, look, I'm gonna blog every week, three times a week, and you have to stick to that schedule, right?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "Because until you do that for like several years, you're never gonna get anywhere."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And part of that is having the discipline to stick with the schedule."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And it helps, again, if it's something you're passionate about, this won't feel like work."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "You're like, I love this."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I could talk about this all day, every day, right?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "You just have to do it in a way that's interesting to other people."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And then as you're growing the community, that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these artifacts, like even in the case of blogging, like I felt in the early days of my blog, which I started in 2004, which is really the genesis of Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "If you look at all my blog, it leads up to Stack Overflow, which was, I have all this energy in my blog, but I don't, like 40,000 people were subscribing to me."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And I was like, I wanna do something."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And then I met Joel and said, hey, Joel, I wanna do something, take this ball of energy from my blog and do something."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "And all the people reading my blog saw that."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "It's like, oh, cool."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "You're involving us."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're saying, look, you're part of this community."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Let's build this thing together."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Like they pick the name."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Like we voted on the name for Stack Overflow on my blog."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Like we came up, and naming is super hard."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "First of all, the hardest problem in computer science is coming up with a good name for stuff, right?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "But you can go back to my blog."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "There's the poll where we voted and Stack Overflow became the name of the site."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And all the early beta users of Stack Overflow were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog, right?"}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So we started from, like, if you look at the genesis, okay, I was just a programmer who said, hey, I love programming, but I have no outlet to talk about it."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So I'm just gonna blog about it, because I don't have enough people to work to talk to about it."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "Because at the time I worked a place where, you know, programming wasn't the core output of the company, it was a pharmaceutical company."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "So I was like, I'll just blog about it."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And then I'll find an audience and eventually found an audience, eventually found Joel, and eventually built Stack Overflow from that one core of activity, right?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments, feedback from Joel, feedback from the early Stack Overflow community."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "When people see that you're doing that, they will follow along with you, right?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "They'll say, cool, you're here in good faith."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "You're actually, you know, not listening to everything because that's impossible, that's impossible."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "But you're actually, you know, waiting our feedback and what you're doing."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And why wouldn't I?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Because who does all the work on Stack Overflow?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Me, Joel?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "No, it's the other programmers that are doing all the work."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So you gotta have some respect for that."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And then, you know, discipline around, look, you know, we're trying to do a very specific thing here on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "We're not trying to solve all the world's problems."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "We're trying to solve this very specific Q and A problem in a very specific way."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Not cause we're jerks about it, but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results, right?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And programmers, that's an easy sell for the most part because programmers are used to dealing with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "That's basically their job."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So they're very, oh yeah, super strict system of rules that lets me get what I want."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "That's programming, right?"}, {"time": 1671, "text": "That's what Stack Overflow is, so."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So you're making it sound easy, but in 2004, let's go back there."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "In 2004, you started the blog, Coding Horror."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "Was it called that at the very beginning?"}, {"time": 1684, "text": "One of the smart things I did, it's from a book by Steve McConnell, Code Complete, which is one of my favorite programming books, still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "So one of the smart things I did back then, I don't always do smart things when I start stuff."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I contacted Steve and said, hey, I really like this."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "It was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code, right?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Coding Horror was like, watch out."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And I love that illustration because it spoke to me."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Because I saw that illustration go, oh my God, that's me."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Like I'm always my own worst enemy."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Like that's the key insight in programming is every time you write something, think how am I gonna screw myself?"}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Because you will, constantly, right?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So that icon was like, oh yeah, I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look, and say, look, you're very fallible."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "You're gonna screw this up."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Like how can you build this in such a way that you're not gonna screw it up later?"}, {"time": 1730, "text": "Like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step I'm thinking through all the things that I could do wrong or that other people could do wrong?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times, right?"}, {"time": 1740, "text": "So that sidebar illustration, I loved it so much."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said, hey, can I have permission to use this because I just really like this illustration?"}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that and just continues to give me permission, so yeah."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "Really, that's awesome."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "But in 2004, you started this blog."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "You know, you look at Stephen King, his book on writing, or Stephen Pressfield, War of Art book."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "I mean, it seems like writers suffer."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "I mean, it's a hard process of writing, right?"}, {"time": 1772, "text": "There's gonna be suffering."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "I mean, I won't kid you."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Well, the work is suffering, right?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "Like doing the work, like even when you're every week, you're like, okay, that blog post wasn't very good or people didn't like it or people said disparaging things about it."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "You have to like have the attitude like, you know, no matter what happens, I wanna do this for me, right?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "It's not about you, it's about me."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "I mean, in the end, it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the world."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "But you have to be pretty strict about saying like, you know, I'm selfish in the sense that I have to do this for me."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "You know, you mentioned Stephen King, like his book on writing."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "But like one of the things I do, for example, when writing is like, I read it out loud."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud, like multiple times and make it sound like you're talking because that is the goal of good writing."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "It should sound like you said it with slightly better phrasing because you have more time to think about what you're saying but like, it should sound natural when you say it."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I think that's probably the single best writing advice I can give anyone."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Just read it over and over out loud, make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "And what's your process of writing?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "See, there's usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So ideas, right."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So I think you gotta have the concept that there's so many interesting things in the world."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Like, I mean, my God, the world is amazing, right?"}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Like you can never write about everything that's going on because it's so incredible."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "But if you can't come up with like, let's say one interesting thing per day to talk about, then you're not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super interesting stuff."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And one great way to like mine stuff is go back to old books cause they bring up old stuff that's still super relevant."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "And I did that a lot cause I was like reading classic programming books and a lot of the early blog posts were like, oh, I was reading this programming book and they brought this really cool concept and I wanna talk about it some more."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And you get the, I mean, you're not claiming credit for the idea but it gives you something interesting to talk about that's kind of evergreen, right?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Like you don't have to go, what should I talk about?"}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So we'll just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something that, oh, wow, that's interesting."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Or how does that apply today?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Or what about X and Y or compare these two concepts."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So pull a couple of sentences from that book and then sort of play off of it, almost agree or disagree."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So in 2007, you wrote that you were offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "You chose not to."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "What were all the elements you were thinking about?"}, {"time": 1908, "text": "Cause I'd like to take you back."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "It seems like there's a lot of nonlinear decisions you made through life."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "So what was that decision like?"}, {"time": 1916, "text": "Right, so one of the things I love is the Choose Your Own Adventure books, which I loved as a kid and I feel like they're early programmer books cause they're all about if then statements, right?"}, {"time": 1924, "text": "If this, then this."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "And they're also very, very unforgiving."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Like there's all these sites that map the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books and how many outcomes are bad, a lot of bad outcomes."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So part of the game is like, oh, I got a bad outcome."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Go back one step, go back one further step."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It's like, how did I get here, right?"}, {"time": 1939, "text": "Like it's a sequence of decisions."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "And this is true of life, right?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Like every decision is a sequence, right?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Individually, any individual decision is not necessarily right or wrong, but they lead you down a path, right?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So I do think there's some truth to that."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "So this particular decision, the blog had gotten fairly popular."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "There's a lot of RSS readers that I had discovered."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And this guy contacted me out of the blue from this like bug tracking company."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "He's like, oh, I really wanna buy your blog for like, I think it was around, it was $100,000, it might have been like 80,000, but it was a lot, right?"}, {"time": 1969, "text": "Like, and that's, you know, at the time, like I would have a year's worth of salary all at once."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So I didn't really think about like, well, you know, and I remember talking to people at the time, I was like, wow, that's a lot of money."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "But then I'm like, I really like my blog, right?"}, {"time": 1982, "text": "Like, do I wanna sell my blog?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Cause it wouldn't really belong to me anymore at that point."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "Cause if you pick the safe choice, it's usually, you're not really pushing."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "You're not pushing yourself."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "You're not choosing the thing that's gonna help you grow."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So for me, the scarier choice was to say no."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "I was like, well, no, let's just see where this is going."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Because then I own it."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "I mean, it belongs to me."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It's my thing."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And I can just take it and tell some other logical conclusion, right?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "Because imagine how different the world would have been had I said yes and sold the blog."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "It's like, there probably wouldn't be Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "You know, a lot of other stuff would have changed."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "So for that particular decision, I think it was that same rule."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Like what scares me a little bit more."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "Do the thing that scares you."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So speaking of which, startups."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "I think there's a specific, some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "You've started Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "You started this course."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "So what's the, it was one, two, three guys, whatever it is in the beginning."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "What was that process like?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "Do you start talking about it?"}, {"time": 2060, "text": "Do you start programming?"}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Do you start, like, where's the birth and the catalyst that actually."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Well, I can talk about it in the context of both Stack Overflow and Discourse."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So I think the key thing initially is there is a problem."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Something, there's some state of the world that's unsatisfactory to the point that, like, you're upset about it, right?"}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like, in that case, it was experts exchange."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "I mean, Joel's original idea, because I approached Joel as like, look, Joel, I have all this energy behind my blog."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "I want to do something."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I want to build something."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "But I don't know what it is, because I'm honestly not a good idea person."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "I'm

my forte."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "Which is another reason why I like the community feedback, because they blue sky all day long for you, right?"}, {"time": 2096, "text": "So when I can just go in

that's step one."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "Genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about, right?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And then people galvanize around the idea."}, {"time": 2166, "text":

step."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "It's like, having an idea you're super excited about, and another person, a cofounder, right?"}, {"time": 2234, "text": "Because again, you get that dual leadership,

I was doing that led me to Robin, right?"}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Was that."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And then when we, for example, when we did Stack Overflow, we're like, okay, well, I really

downvoted."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "It doesn't work that way, right?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "So this is an interesting point and a small tangent."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "You write about anxiety."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "So I've posted a lot of questions and written answers on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "On the question side, you usually go to something very specific to something I'm working on."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "And this is something you talk about that really the goal of Stack Overflow isn't about, is to write a question that's not about you, it's about the question that will help the community in the future."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Right, but that's a tough sell, right?"}, {"time": 2377, "text": "Because people are like, well, I don't really care about the community."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "What I care about is my problem."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "And that's fair, right?"}, {"time": 2383, "text": "It's sort of that, again, that tension,

problem."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Okay, a problem, that's great."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "You need specifics."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So it's trying to help you make a good question title, for example, that step will be broken out, all that stuff."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "But one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say, hey, I'm a little nervous."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "I've never done this before."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Can you put me in a queue for special mentoring?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "You could opt in to a special mentor."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "I think that would be fantastic."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "I don't have any objection to that at all in terms of being an opt in system."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "Because there are people that are like, I

fine."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "It's not precluded from happening."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "But there's a certain big city ethos that we started with."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Like, look, we're

you're a busy professional, certainly when you ask a question, you're gonna ask the best possible question."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Because you're a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a very well written question with a lot of detail about why you're doing it, what you're doing, what you researched, what you found, because you're a professional like me."},

want just a more chill place for beginners."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And I still think Stack Overflow is not, was never designed for beginners, right?"}, {"time": 2561, "text": "There's this misconception that, even Joel says sometimes, oh yeah, Stack Overflow for beginners."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And I think if you're a prodigy, it can be."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "But for the most part, not."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "But that's not really representative, right?"}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Like, I think as a beginner, you want a totally different set of tools."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "You want like live screen sharing, live chat."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "You want access to resources."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "You want a playground, like a playground you can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just don't give people because that was never really the audience that we were designing Stack Overflow for."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "That doesn't mean it's wrong."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And I think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet, or if Stack Overflow said, hey, you know, we're gonna start doing this."},

pressure, the tension that you described is there for people to be, look, I'm a little nervous because I know I gotta do my best work, right?"}, {"time": 2606, "text": "The other one is something you talk about, which is also really interesting to me, is duplicate questions or it's a really difficult problem that you highlight."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "It's super hard."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "Like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 10, 20, 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "I don't know if there should be one page that answers all of it."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Is there a way that Stack Overflow can help disambiguate, like separate these duplicate questions or connect them together?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult, impossible task?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "I think it's a very, very hard computer science problem."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "And partly because people are very good at using completely different words."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "It always amazed me on Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "You'd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Like, oh my God, from a computer science perspective, how do you even begin to solve that?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "And it happens all the time."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "People are super good at this, right?"}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Accidentally at asking the same thing in like 10, 20 different ways."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist because if there's five versions with different words, have those five versions point to the one centralized answer, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "It's like, okay, this is a duplicate, no worries."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Here's the answer that you wanted over here on the prime example that we want to have, rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "Because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer, this also devalues the reputation system, which programmers hate, as I previously mentioned."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "You're getting reputation for an answer that somebody else already gave."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "It's like, well, it's an answer, but somebody else already gave that answer."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave it four years ago?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "People get offended by that, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "And for the most part, that's good."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "I know it sounds weird, but for most parts, like look, strict systems, I think to use Stack Overflow, you have to have the idea that, OK, strict systems ultimately work better."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And I do think in programming, you're familiar with loose typing versus strict typing, right?"}, {"time": 2731, "text": "The idea that you can declare a variable, not declare a variable, rather, just start using a variable."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And OK, I see it's implicitly an integer."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Bam, awesome."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Duck equals 5."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Well, duck is now an integer of 5, right?"}, {"time": 2740, "text": "And you're like, cool, awesome, simpler, right?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Why would I want to worry about typing?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And for a long time, in the Ruby community, they're like, yeah, this is awesome."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "You just do a bunch of unit testing, which is testing your program's validity after the fact to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables would have caught."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "And now you have this thing called TypeScript for Microsoft from the guy who built C Sharp Anders, who's one of the greatest minds in software development, right, like in terms of language design."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And says, no, no, no, we want to bolt on a strict type system to JavaScript because it makes things better."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And now everybody's like, oh my god, we deployed TypeScript and found 50 latent bugs that we didn't know about, right?"}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Like, this is super common."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So I think there is a truth in programming that strictness, it's not the goal."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "We're not saying be super strict because strictness is correct."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "No, it's no, no."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Strictness produces better results."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "That's what I'm saying, right?"}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So strict typing of variables, I would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "Should be that way in every language, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Duck equals five should generate an error because no, you didn't declare."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "You didn't tell me that duck was an integer, right?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "That's a bug, right?"}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Or maybe you mistyped."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "You typed deck instead of duck, right?"}, {"time": 2806, "text": "You never know."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "This happens all the time, right?"}, {"time": 2808, "text": "So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness of the system is correct."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "Now, that doesn't mean cruel."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "That doesn't mean mean."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "That doesn't mean angry."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "It just means strict, OK?"}, {"time": 2817, "text": "So I think where there's misunderstanding is people get cranky, right?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "Like, another question you asked is like, why are programmers kind of mean sometimes?"}, {"time": 2825, "text": "Well, who do programmers work with all day long?"}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So I have a theory that if you're at a job and you work with assholes all day long, what do you eventually become?"}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "Because the computer has no time for your bullshit."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "The computer, the minute you make a mistake, everything is crashing down, right?"}, {"time": 2845, "text": "One semicolon has crashed space missions, right?"}, {"time": 2848, "text": "So that's normal."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So you begin to internalize that."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "You begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer, is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So that's kind of how I'm going to be."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "Because I work with this computer, and I have to exceed to its terms on everything."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "So therefore, you start to absorb that."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "You start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily is really good."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because that's what the computer gave me, right?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So you kind of forget to be a person at some level."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And you know how they say great detectives internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves, like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the criminal."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Well, I do think that's true of programmers."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Really good programmers think like the computer because that's their job."}, {"time": 2894,

accidental."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "But I do believe it's an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "You're very

do, but I was convinced by all these articles, like 30, 40 megabytes of stuff just to serve you ads."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "Yeah, it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange of whenever

model."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "It's not effective."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "Like it's too diluted, it's too weird, it doesn't pay well, and like users hate it."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "So it's a combination of like users hate it, it doesn't actually work that well in practice."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "Like in theory, yes, I agree with you."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "If you had clean, fast ads that were exactly the stuff you would be interested in, awesome."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "We're so far from that though, right?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Like, and Google does an okay job."},

reasons."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "But you know what does work is subscriptions, Patreon, affiliate codes for like Amazon, of like just, oh, here's a cool yo yo, click, and then you click and go to Amazon, they get a small percentage of that, which is fair, I think."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "I mean, because you saw the yo yo on that site and you clicked through and you bought it, right?"},

used to participate on a lot, I helped the owner."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "One of the things, I got them to switch to discourse."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "I basically paid them to switch to discourse because I was like, look, you guys got to switch."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "I can't come here anymore on this terrible software."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "But I was like, look, and on top of that, like you're serving people ads that they hate."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "Like you should just go full on Patreon because he had a little bit of Patreon."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "Go full on Patreon, do the Amazon affiliates thing for any Amazon links that get posted and just do that and just triple down on that stuff."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "And that's worked really well for them and
