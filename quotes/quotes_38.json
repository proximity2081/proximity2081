fact, I think I'm happier now."}, {"time": 318, "text": "I know I'm happier now."}, {"time": 319, "text": "So looking back, would you do it the same way all again?"}, {"time": 326, "text": "Really, even the thrill of it?"}, {"time": 328, "text": "Not even thrill of it."}, {"time": 329, "text": "It wasn't worth 33 years in prison, being away from my lovely family."}, {"time": 334, "text": "So money, what about the power?"}, {"time": 337, "text": "Just being on top of the world where nobody can, not the governments, the police, all the big, bad agencies chasing you, and you could do whatever the heck you wanted."}, {"time": 352, "text": "As far as having to look over your shoulder everywhere you went and every phone call you made, make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean before you talked."}, {"time": 363, "text": "It's rather uncomfortable."}, {"time": 367, "text": "I like to make phone calls the same way."}, {"time": 369, "text": "What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin Cartel?"}, {"time": 378, "text": "He was just, just seemed like a gentleman when I met him."}, {"time": 381, "text": "He was just like you and I, sitting here, shook hands, and I had flown one load for a fellow, and it didn't work out well."}, {"time": 388, "text": "The fellow that I gave it to got shot, and it took a while to get my money, and they didn't put as many kilos on the plane as they're supposed to, and so I wasn't gonna work with him anymore, and my contact down there introduced me to Jorge Ochoa, and we went up, and in Vigado, we went up and the gate opened, and we was escorted in."}, {"time": 407, "text": "There must have been 50 men out in the yards, hitching a rail on an old house, and we was escorted right in, and there was a beautiful woman in there."}, {"time": 417, "text": "I mean, gore, drop dead beautiful, and she made us a cup of coffee, then ushered in to see Jorge Ochoa, and he had 12 telephones on his desk, and all of them was a different color, and he shook hands, was very friendly, spoke English, and he said that each one of those telephones represented another city in the United States."}, {"time": 438, "text": "This is Chicago, and this is New York."}, {"time": 475, "text": "He said 300, 500, so that's one and a half, two and a half million dollars for an eight hour trip."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Sounded pretty good to me."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And we're talking about cocaine."}, {"time": 484, "text": "Cocaine."}, {"time": 484, "text": "And we're talking about Colombia."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Colombia, and cocaine, and Medellin cartel."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And Jorge Ochoa was one of the, what would you say, founding members of the Medellin?"}, {"time": 494, "text": "He was probably the brains behind the whole thing."}, {"time": 496, "text": "The brains, and spoke good English."}, {"time": 498, "text": "And they were nice people."}, {"time": 499, "text": "Really nice people."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Were you scared?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "What's wrong with your mind that you weren't scared?"}, {"time": 506, "text": "Here's some of the most dangerous men in this world, and you weren't scared."}, {"time": 511, "text": "Well, I knew I was gonna do exactly what I said I was gonna do."}, {"time": 514, "text": "Murray and the children were down there."}, {"time": 515, "text": "They went down and they stayed in the hotel, five stars, treated royally on my first load."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And they just did ask security to make sure that I wasn't a DEA agent."}, {"time": 524, "text": "So I did the first load, and they can say they were hostages, but they really weren't."}, {"time": 531, "text": "It was just insurance."}, {"time": 533, "text": "So there was some integrity to the way they operated."}, {"time": 537, "text": "I mean, straight up."}, {"time": 540, "text": "The money was ironed and banded, banded and just right."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And the numbers were never once anything wrong with it."}, {"time": 549, "text": "What would you attribute that honesty to?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Within their own moral system and their own set of rules, why weren't people crossing the line and shaving off the top and injecting chaos into the system to where it would be unpredictable and people would be dishonest and greedy and all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "Most people are, but there's certain people at the top of the food chain that they don't need that."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And if they're completely honest, then they don't have to think of, remember the lie they told."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And plus they're just honest to start with."}, {"time": 585, "text": "They're making plenty of money."}, {"time": 588, "text": "They was making as much money as I did."}, {"time": 591, "text": "I'll tell you how that came about."}, {"time": 594, "text": "I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year in Medellin, Colombia, and what they were doing, they didn't have any organization."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And if one fellow had 10 kilos and he wanted it shipped to New York, he would tell his friend and his friend says, sure, I'll ship it."}, {"time": 611, "text": "I have a pilot and I'll ship it up."}, {"time": 613, "text": "And then he would look in the newspapers, oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I'm so sorry, yours got busted."}, {"time": 619, "text": "Bang, bang, he's dead."}, {"time": 622, "text": "So here comes Jorge Ochoa and the three Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar and Gacho."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And they decided that we will make an insurance company, that we will charge you $10,000 to take it to your contact in Miami."}, {"time": 639, "text": "If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it on the airplane or the time you give it to us and the time we give it to your man, we will replace it in Colombia for you."}, {"time": 650, "text": "So there was no way anybody could lose."}, {"time": 652, "text": "And I understand they got a hundred tons piled up under that insurance program."}, {"time": 657, "text": "And I was right there the first day."}, {"time": 660, "text": "So I had all the work I could do."}, {"time": 663, "text": "I would land and I said, when do you want me to come back?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "We're waiting on you, Senor."}, {"time": 668, "text": "Well, let me ask a difficult question."}, {"time": 670, "text": "Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer and some see him as maybe a Robin Hood like figure who helped the poor."}, {"time": 679, "text": "How do you see the man?"}, {"time": 682, "text": "I think he started out to be honest with help the poor."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And then they had a war down there and they blew up and killed his people."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And the country was divided almost equally three ways."}, {"time": 692, "text": "They had the military."}, {"time": 696, "text": "They were just as much into it as anybody."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And then you had the FARC guerrillas."}, {"time": 700, "text": "They had about a third of the country."}, {"time": 702, "text": "And then you had the Contras."}, {"time": 703, "text": "It was like the white farmers and they're the ones that I was dealing with and they were at war with one another."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And so if one of them started killing their people, well, I'll kill some of yours too."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So that's how it happened."}, {"time": 717, "text": "And then when I heard about Pablo Escobar blowing up that airliner and killing those women and children, I was sorry I ever shook his hand."}, {"time": 725, "text": "That's brutal murder."}, {"time": 727, "text": "So you would say Escobar is not a good man?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "He's terrible."}, {"time": 733, "text": "Now, looking back on it, when I met him, he was good."}, {"time": 736, "text": "Did just exactly what he said he would do."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Could he be a bad man and a man you can trust?"}, {"time": 742, "text": "Are those the things you..."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Absolutely you could trust him, yes."}, {"time": 747, "text": "So from your perspective, in terms of business, he was reliable, he was honest, had integrity."}, {"time": 755, "text": "You could work with him and he felt safe."}, {"time": 759, "text": "We flew up to his ranch and we brought out motorcycles to start with."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And can you ride a motorcycle?"}, {"time": 766, "text": "Of course I can ride a motorcycle."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So I took off across the grass and there was a little ditch there and the front wheel dropped in that thing and I must have slid across that grass 20 feet before I got stopped."}, {"time": 777, "text": "He almost fell off of his bike waiting because they knew what it was gonna do."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And then we got on horses and we went out there and pretended to round up some cows and he put a Mac 10 machine gun pistol over my shoulder."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Do you know how to use this?"}, {"time": 790, "text": "Well, I never had, but it was all right."}, {"time": 793, "text": "I think it was like, okay, you got 10 bodyguards, what do you need me for?"}, {"time": 797, "text": "So that's the kind of time we laughed and talked and drove some cows over the stumps."}, {"time": 803, "text": "You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains of the Medellin cartel."}, {"time": 810, "text": "What was he like?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "And why do you say he was the brains?"}, {"time": 815, "text": "Well, he was a gentleman."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And I suppose he shipped, and don't tell me how many more times of cocaine than Pablo did."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Just him and his brothers, you could tell by the, they had on each load, they was in duffel bags and his big football shaped fluffy stuff made with ether."}, {"time": 835, "text": "And they would have three horns on it or a rattlesnake or four Xs on each bag."}, {"time": 842, "text": "You kind of got to knowing which was which and they shipped a lot."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So, and he was just a gentleman."}, {"time": 849, "text": "I took the family, we went one weekend to his ranch or his palatial place out near Barranquilla and oh, he just treated the family."}, {"time": 860, "text": "His family had, his younger brother made a bull fight and we had skiing and little airplanes on floats on the water."}, {"time": 872, "text": "He was really nice and he was really nice."}, {"time": 876, "text": "How do you make sense of the tension that a man could be a gentleman, can have integrity, but also be a murderer?"}, {"time": 884, "text": "Well, murder is a stronger word than killing."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Can you explain the line, the gray area we're talking about?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "I mean, I've just talking with Jocko Willing, can we talk a lot about killing in the context of military conflict in the context of war?"}, {"time": 905, "text": "So there, there's a line between murder and killing that you can draw."}, {"time": 909, "text": "What's the line that you're referring to?"}, {"time": 911, "text": "It's something similar."}, {"time": 913, "text": "If people are shooting at you and you shoot back and kill him, that's not murder whatsoever."}, {"time": 917, "text": "He's trying to get away or out of the situation."}, {"time": 922, "text": "But if some woman don't pay you and you send a hit man over to kill her and her children, that's murder."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 933, "text": "I don't think so at all."}, {"time": 934, "text": "I mean, he was just such a gentleman."}, {"time": 936, "text": "He had a restaurant before and he was just smart."}, {"time": 939, "text": "I understand that the first 10 kilos he sold, he was sitting on a motorcycle in the sidelines in a parking lot and when the DEA come in, he sped away."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So he didn't come back to America."}, {"time": 951, "text": "He was just smart."}, {"time": 952, "text": "Some people just are savvy."}, {"time": 953, "text": "And he was such a gentleman."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And the whole family, the mother and the father, the two brothers, their sister, I was there when she was kidnapped."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And finally, he kidnapped our, I guess, 100 leaders of the FARC and said, all right, when she don't come back, none of these are gonna come back."}, {"time": 973, "text": "So they made a deal."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Is there something you can say about the power structure, the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel that you interacted with?"}, {"time": 981, "text": "Was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "Was there a bunch of power centers?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "Was it like a company where you have CEO, CTO kind of thing?"}, {"time": 992, "text": "And then there's like managers and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 995, "text": "How did it run from a leadership perspective?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "I understand that about five of them got together and made this, I would call it an insurance company."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And now known as the Medellin Cartel."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And I didn't see any difference."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Each one of them had their own business."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And their people from the jungle or wherever made the cocaine, gave it to them and they shipped it."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And so it didn't seem to be any power play between them at all."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar was right there."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And I saw plenty of stuff for him too."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's strange that they didn't betray each other regularly."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "You know, greed makes men betray each other."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "How much betrayal did you see?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I didn't see any, absolutely none."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "If they shipped his 100 kilos, he got paid for it."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And if the other one shipped his, I'm sure they got paid for it."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Well, there was no need to."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "The money was just unbelievable."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "You think about 500 kilos in the plane at $50,000 a kilo at the time."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "And they paid $5,000 to ship it."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And they made 5,000 without even touching it."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "I gave it to their man in Miami."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "They gave it to whoever it belonged to by the marks on the duffel bags."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "So they was making just untold millions."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Just no reason."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "But greed can blind men."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "It's still strange to me that there was not more betrayal."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "It speaks to something else perhaps that's bigger than money."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But it seems like just like in the casino, like you mentioned, we get accustomed to whatever level of money we have, we get accustomed very quickly."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And then there's a tension that's natural between human beings."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "And when that tension combined with money, combined with power, combined with, like you mentioned, beautiful women and a bit of violence, it seems that betrayal should be commonplace."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It wasn't, not at all."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Carlos later, I don't know if he betrayed anybody, but he started that."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "He was running cocaine through the Bahamas near the island."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "I didn't go."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "I was offered to fly with a DC3 with that, but I didn't like it."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So I had my route through the old wells in Louisiana."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "And so I wasn't gonna change, but he talked a lot and I don't know if he betrayed, but they didn't like him."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Yeah, so as you expand, there could be tensions that lead to conflict."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Columbia was, like you said, an ultra violent place."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "How did you survive?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "Who protected you?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "I was a hero."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "They liked me."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "I mean, I was just treated royally."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "All I did, I would come over El Banco."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "There's a radio station at the Forks of the Magdalena River."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "I believe it was 720, if I remember right, on the AM."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "And I'd fly in at 10,000 feet and I'd see below me there'd be a Cessna."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And I'd wiggle my wings and he'd wiggle his and I'd fall in behind him and we might go 100, 200 miles."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "I'd land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And they'd fuel me up."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "I could eat steak in the night."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It was just like treated royally."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And I mean, take off the next morning whenever I wanted to."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "It was just like that was protected."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And I was honored guest."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "It wasn't anything like in that movie, putting a gun to your head and taking your sunglasses and betting."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So one time I complained to Jorge Ochoa that the runway was pretty short that they were using."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "And I went back down and it looked like Los Angeles International."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "They had bulldozers in there."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Had that thing 5,000 feet long."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "Just like, just the next week it was all done."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "The jungle was gone and clay put up there."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And all the while you were not afraid."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "You were treated like royalty."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Yes, there I was."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "I was afraid when I landed in the United States."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Well, maybe let's go back to the beginning."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "What was the first time you flew an airplane with drugs on it?"}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Tell me the story of the first time you smuggled drugs."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "All right, I flew down to Jalapa, Veracruz with a Cessna 182."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And we landed at the town."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "It was a lovely town and just an old town."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "Looked like Bible times."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "People, women were washing your clothes in the streets and with stone basins and the stream running through."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "I just was just dumbstruck."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "It was just so pretty."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And I went in a church and a Catholic church and it had the stations of the cross all carved magnificent."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "I'd never seen that."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "And I come home and told Mary about that."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "That just almost brought tears to my eyes."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "It was so beautiful."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "And three o clock the next morning I went out to the airport and taxied down to the taxiway and there was a guard came out and wanted to know what I was doing."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "And I pulled out, I was on the fire department at Redondo Beach, California."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So I pulled out my wallet and in it was the fire department badge."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And oh, he shook my hand and was so glad."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So I taxied on down there and we loaded up about 400 pounds in the plane."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And came on back and I was running to headwinds more than I thought and I landed on a little strip."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "You're talking about on the way back?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "On the way back, on the way north after we loaded up early in the morning."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And that's the only time I ever got vertigo."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "The mountains were coming down at a 30, 40 degree angle and the Milky Way was overhead."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And somehow I wanted that airplane to be level with the stars."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And it got me, it's a phenomenal pile of vertigo."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "It's the only time I ever had it was on that load."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "I wasn't gonna make it to the dry lake where I had fuel."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "So I landed on a little bitty strip and there was a little house."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "It was caved in and it was a little boy named Lazarus, about six or seven years old."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And he was herding some goats."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So we put the marijuana in that house and the man stayed with it while I flew into some town and got fuel and came back and we sat down with the lunch that I brought back and little Lazarus sat there and ate with us and we had a good time."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "We loaded on back and came on home."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Oh wow, I wonder where he is now."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "So what was it like to fly, maybe describe the details of, do you have to fly low?"}, {"time": 1396, "text": "Is there details that are unique to this experience of flying an airplane with drugs on it, on board?"}, {"time": 1404, "text": "All right, well, one of the mistakes that just thousands, hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pilots make, they don't stop at the border, going down and get their permit."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Once you get a permit to be in Mexico, you've got it for six months."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "You can go anywhere, any fishing village, any little town, any little place, show them this and you're welcome."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "If you don't have that, you go straight to jail."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "So you go down there and you think, okay, they're gonna have fuel for me to come back and so forth."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Oh, sorry, Senor, that had a rusty leak in it."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "We don't have any."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Well, you better be able to go to town and get it."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So that's what I did."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And when I was coming back for several years, I would fly up at Mexicali and cross the border right at Calexico."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "I would act like I was landing on the Calexico side just after dark and then I'd zip across the border and I'd go over to the Salton Sea and go below sea level, 100 and something feet, I believe 170 feet, and come on up and go out there above Palm Springs and land at 29 Palms in the desert and put my stuff under a Joshua tree and fly into town and get my pickup and go on back out and get it."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And that was fun."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "And then it got really dangerous."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And they called a lot of pilots coming across the border."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "So I changed it."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And by that time I was flying bigger planes."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "I was flying Beach 18s."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And I would refuel in Mulahe halfway down on the Baja Peninsula."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And then over in the
