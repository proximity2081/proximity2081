remotely measuring, you're taking the temperature of Jupiter or whatever in effect."}, {"time": 320, "text": "And so it's allowing you to basically teleport and there's no other science that you can really do that, right?"}, {"time": 326, "text": "If you're an archeologist, you can't, let me get into my time machine and go back and see what was Lucy really like, it's not possible."}, {"time": 333, "text": "So the same thing happens, this is where I've learned about this from March of the Penguins, when the penguins huddled together, the body temperature arrives to the same place."}, {"time": 343, "text": "So you're doing this remotely, the March of the Penguins, but remote."}, {"time": 346, "text": "We do it from Antarctica too, so there are some penguins around when we do it."}, {"time": 350, "text": "Okay, excellent."}, {"time": 351, "text": "You mentioned time machine, I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize, you talk about time machines."}, {"time": 359, "text": "So let me ask you the question of, take us back in time, what happened at the beginning of our universe?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "Ah, okay, usually people preface this by saying I have a simple question."}, {"time": 371, "text": "So what happened before the universe began, what happened?"}, {"time": 375, "text": "Brian Keating teaching me about comedy."}, {"time": 378, "text": "I have a simple question for you, let's take two."}, {"time": 380, "text": "I have a simple question, what happened at the beginning of our universe?"}, {"time": 385, "text": "So when we think about what happened, it's more correct, it's more logical, it's more practical to go back in time starting from today."}, {"time": 394, "text": "So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today, that's some day, right?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "I mean, you could translate into some day, right?"}, {"time": 403, "text": "So on that day, something happened."}, {"time": 405, "text": "Earlier than the moment exactly now, let's say we're talking around one o clock."}, {"time": 412, "text": "So at some point during that day, the universe started to become a fusion reactor."}, {"time": 417, "text": "It started to fuse light elements and isotopes into heavier elements and isotopes of those heavier elements."}, {"time": 423, "text": "After that period of time, going forward back closer to today, less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier, or later rather coming towards us today, we know more and more about what the universe was like."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And in fact, all the hydrogen, it's a very good approximation in the water molecules in this bottle, almost all of them were produced during that first 20 minute period."}, {"time": 443, "text": "So I would say, the actual fusion and production of the lightest elements on the periodic table occurred in a time period shorter than the TV show, The Big Bang Theory."}, {"time": 454, "text": "Well done, sir."}, {"time": 455, "text": "You know, most of those light elements besides hydrogen aren't really used in your encounter, right?"}, {"time": 461, "text": "You don't encounter helium that often, unless you go to a lot of birthday parties or pilot a blimp."}, {"time": 467, "text": "You don't need lithium, hopefully, you know, but other than that, those are the kinds of things that were produced during that moment."}, {"time": 472, "text": "The question became, how did the heavier things like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later."}, {"time": 476, "text": "And I brought some samples for us to discuss and how those came from a very different type of process called a different type of fusion reactor and a different type of process explosion as well called a supernova."}, {"time": 488, "text": "However, if you go back beyond those first three minutes, we really have to say almost nothing because we are not capable."}, {"time": 495, "text": "In other words, going backwards from the first three minutes, as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book, we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over."}, {"time": 505, "text": "In other words, we can't speculate on what happened three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen was formed in our universe."}, {"time": 512, "text": "We just don't know enough about that epoch."}, {"time": 514, "text": "There are many people, most people, most practicing card carrying cosmologists believe the universe began in what's called the singularity."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And we can certainly talk about that."}, {"time": 524, "text": "However, singularity is so far removed from anything we can ever hope to prove, hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And really only occurs in two instantiations, the big bang and the core of a black hole, neither of which is observable."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And so for that reason, there are now flourishing alternatives that say, you can actually for the first time ask the question that day, Tuesday in the first moments of our universe, there was a Tuesday a week before that, 24 hours times seven days before that."}, {"time": 555, "text": "That has a perfectly well understood meaning in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more eminent of cosmologists working today."}, {"time": 565, "text": "When I was in grad school over 25 years ago, no one really considered anything besides that big bang that there was a singularity."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And people would have to say, as I said, we just don't know."}, {"time": 576, "text": "But they would say some future incarnation of some experiment will tell us the answer."}, {"time": 580, "text": "But now there are people that are saying there is an alternative to the big bang."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And it's not really fringe science as it once was 50, 80 years ago when these models... By the way, the first cosmology in history was not a singular universe."}, {"time": 595, "text": "The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten Ra and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And in that, they talked about cyclical universes."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court, he'd have a pretty high H index right about now because people have been using that cyclical model from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis and right up until this very moment."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives to the big bang theory?"}, {"time": 627, "text": "So there are many alternatives starting with..."}, {"time": 629, "text": "So the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding singular origin of the universe, that stands in contrast to these other models in which time does not have a beginning and many of them feature cycles, at least one cycle, possibly infinite number of cycles, called by Sir Roger Penrose."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And they all have things in common, these alternatives, as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis, which is inflation."}, {"time": 656, "text": "Inflation can be thought of as this spark that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood."}, {"time": 663, "text": "So it's an earlier condition, but it's still not an initial condition."}, {"time": 666, "text": "In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock or a pendulum swinging back and forth."}, {"time": 671, "text": "You look away for a second, you come into the room, pendulum swinging back and forth."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Alex, tell me, where did it start?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "How many cycles is it gonna make before the era?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "You can't answer that question without knowing the initial conditions."}, {"time": 682, "text": "In a very simple system, like a one dimensional, simple harmonic oscillator, like a pendulum, think about understanding the whole universe without understanding the initial conditions."}, {"time": 691, "text": "It's a tremendous lacuna, a gap that we have as scientists that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology, determine the quantitative physical properties of the universe prior to what's called the inflationary epoch."}, {"time": 705, "text": "So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch, we can't, because you can infer things about the pendulum before you show up to the room in our current epoch, correct?"}, {"time": 715, "text": "Yeah, so if you look at it right now, but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "So that depends on how much energy it got initially."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance, you had infrared camera, you could see it's getting hotter maybe, and you could do some calculations."}, {"time": 727, "text": "But to know the two things in physics to solve a partial differential equation are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions."}, {"time": 732, "text": "Boundary conditions, we're here on earth, it has gravitational field, it's not gonna excurs, or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum."}, {"time": 739, "text": "It's not, it has simple properties."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So, but this is like, in other words, you can't tell me when did the solar system start orbiting in the way that it does now."}, {"time": 749, "text": "In other words, when did the moon acquire the exact angular momentum that it has now?"}, {"time": 754, "text": "Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example."}, {"time": 756, "text": "But what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch purports and is successful at providing a lot of explanations for how the universe evolved after inflation took place and ended, but it says nothing about how it itself took place."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And that's really what you're asking me."}, {"time": 773, "text": "I mean, you don't really, look, what you care about like big bang nucleosynthesis and the elements got made and these fusion reactors and the whole universe was a fusion reactor, but like, don't you really care about what happened at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "And the problem is we can't really answer that in the context of the big bang."}, {"time": 792, "text": "We can answer that in the context of these alternatives."}, {"time": 795, "text": "So you asked me about some of the alternatives."}, {"time": 796, "text": "So one is Aon theory, the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose."}, {"time": 801, "text": "Another one that was really popular in the 60s and 70s until the discovery of the primary component of my research field, the cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB, the three Kelvin all pervasive signal that astronomers detected in 1965."}, {"time": 816, "text": "That kind of spelled the death knell in some sense to what was called the quasi steady state universe."}, {"time": 823, "text": "And then there was another model that kind of came out of that."}, {"time": 829, "text": "You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state."}, {"time": 831, "text": "Steady state means always existed."}, {"time": 833, "text": "That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And most scientists believed in that for millennia basically."}, {"time": 842, "text": "The universe was eternal, static, unchanging."}, {"time": 845, "text": "They couldn't believe that after Hubble."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So they had to append onto it, concatenate this new feature that it wasn't steady, it was quasi steady."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen every century in a given volume of space."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant."}, {"time": 862, "text": "But because it was producing more and more every century, as centuries pile up and the volume piles up, the universe could expand."}, {"time": 868, "text": "And so that's how they developed it."}, {"time": 869, "text": "That's slowly."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Very slowly."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And it doesn't match observational evidence."}, {"time": 873, "text": "But that is an alternative."}, {"time": 875, "text": "By the way, did Einstein think the steady state universe is infinite or finite?"}, {"time": 881, "text": "I would assume that he thought it was infinite because there was really, if something had a no beginning in time, then it would be very unlikely we're in the center of it or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it."}, {"time": 894, "text": "I wonder what he thought about infinity because that's such an uncomfortable."}, {"time": 897, "text": "Yeah, it's a silly joke."}, {"time": 898, "text": "I'm sure you're familiar with this silly joke, right?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "The silly joke was that there are only two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the universe."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke is a good example of the joke."}, {"time": 912, "text": "It's very meta."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Okay, so, all right, sorry."}, {"time": 916, "text": "You were saying about quasi."}, {"time": 917, "text": "All the alternatives."}, {"time": 918, "text": "All the alternatives in the quasi steady state."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And the most kind of promising, although I hate to say that, people say, well, that's your favorite alternative, right?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "This is not investment advice."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Inflation is not transitory."}, {"time": 931, "text": "It is quasi permanent."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So, a very prominent."}, {"time": 936, "text": "We're talking about cosmic inflation, so calm down, cryptocurrency folks."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Although the first Nobel Prize, and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So, most people don't know that inflation has already won a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 950, "text": "It's a good topic to work on if you won a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 954, "text": "Doesn't matter the field."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Exactly, it's time translation invariant."}, {"time": 957, "text": "So, when we look at the alternative that's called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies, these have serious virtues, according to some."}, {"time": 967, "text": "One of the virtues to me, just as a human, I'm just speaking as a human, one of the founders of the new version of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology is Paul Steinhardt."}, {"time": 982, "text": "He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences at Princeton University."}, {"time": 985, "text": "You may have heard of it."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And he was one of the originators of what was called new inflation."}, {"time": 992, "text": "In other words, he was one of the founding fathers of inflation, who now not only has no belief or support for inflation, he actively claims that inflation is baroque, pernicious, dangerous, malevolent, not to science, not just to cosmology, but to society."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So, here's a man who created a theory that's captivated the world or universe of cosmologists, such as it is."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It's not a huge universe, but there are more podcasters than cosmologists."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Some do both."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "But this man created this theory with collaborators."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And now he's like, I'm like, Paul, you're denying paternity."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "You're like a deadbeat dad."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Now you're saying like, inflation is bogus."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "But he doesn't just attack."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "See, this is what's very important about approaching things as an experimentalist."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "You got a lot of theorists on, and that's wonderful."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And I think that's a huge service."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "An experimentalist has to say no."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "He or she has to be confident to say like, I don't care if I prove you right or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "We have to be like exterminators."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And nobody likes the exterminator until they need one, right?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Or the garbage collectors, right?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "But it's vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry and the simplicity of some idea."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Like inflation is a beautiful idea, but it also has consequences."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And what Paul claims, I don't agree with him fully on this point, is that those consequences are dangerous because they lead to things like the multiverse, which is outside the purview of science."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And in that sense, I can see support for what he does, but none of that detracts from my respect for a man."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "You know, imagine like, you know, Elon comes up with this like really great idea, you know, space, and then he's like, oh, actually it's not gonna work."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "But like, here's this better idea."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And he's like, SpaceX is not gonna work, but he's now creating an alternative to it."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "Doesn't mean he's right."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "Doesn't mean I'm gonna like have more and more attention paid to it because he's my friend or because I respect the idea or I respect the man and his colleague, Anna Aegis, who works really hard with him."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And what it does most foremost is that it removes the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "So it takes away 50% of the motivation for a theory of quantum gravity."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "You've talked a lot about quantum gravity."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "You talk to people, eminent people on the show."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Always latent in those conversations is sort of the teleological expectation that there is a theory of everything."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "There is a theory of quantum gravity."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "But there's no law that says we have to have a theory of quantum gravity."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So that kind of implicit expectation has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So in cosmic inflation, so is that at the core?"}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So okay, maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts on society from believing in cosmic inflation."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So inflation can get started, but then it's like one of, you know, SpaceX rockets."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?"}, {"time": 1214, "text": "It continues the thrusting."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "You need another mechanism to douse the flames of the inflationary expansion, which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere, it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times, including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish, and this is known as the multiverse paradigm."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence, not only of inflationary cosmology, but more and more, we're seeing it in string theory as well."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "So that, you know, sometimes two, you know, branches coming to the same conclusion is, you know, taken as evidence for its reality."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So one of the negative consequences is it creates phenomena that we can't, that are outside the reach of experimental science, or is it that the multiverse somehow has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Like it makes us, maybe it makes life seem more meaningless?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Is that where he's getting at a little bit, or is it not reaching that far?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "The answer is a little of both, because in one sense, it's meant kind of to explain this fine tuning problem, that we find ourselves in a universe that's particularly facund, that has features, you know, consistent with our existence, and how could we be otherwise?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "You know, this sort of weak anthropic principle."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything, literally everything, can be said to predict nothing."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Like if I say, Lex, you know, you've been working out, you look like, you know, yeah, you haven't, yeah, that's great."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "You look like you're, you know, about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "Like, all right, yeah, you're right, but that's horribly imprecise."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "So what good is that?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "That's meaningless."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "You don't contribute any what's called surprise, or reduction in entropy, or reduction of your ignorance about the system, or you know exactly how much you weigh."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So me telling you that tells you nothing."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "In this case, it's basically saying that we're living in a universe because the overwhelming odds of our existence dictate that we would exist."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "There has to be at least one place that we exist."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "But the problem is it's a manifestation of infinity."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So humans, and I'm sure you know this from your work with AI and ML and everything else, that humans, as far as we know, really are the only entities capable of contemplating infinity, but we do so very imperfectly, right?"}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So if I say to you, like, what's bigger, the number of, you know, water molecules in this thing, or the number of real numbers?"}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Or if I say, what's bigger, the number of real numbers or rational numbers?"}, {"time": 1369, "text": "They're all different classifications of the amount of infinities that there could be."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Infinity to the infinity power."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "You know, when you have kids someday, they'll tell you, I love you, infinity."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "You have to come back, I love you, infinity plus one, right?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So, but the human brain can't really contemplate infinity."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Let me illustrate that."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "They say in the singularity, the universe had an infinite temperature, right?"}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Is there anything that you can contemplate in the, you know, Einstein's little quip aside, that's infinite, like a physical property, density, pressure, temperature, energy, that's infinite."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "How does it go from like to half of infinity?"}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Because that's still infinity."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "How did it cool down?"}, {"time": 1416, "text": "How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?"}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So now it's only infinity over two, in terms of pascals."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "Less infinite to more infinite."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's, that's one of the biggest troubling things to me about infinity is you can't truly hold it inside our minds."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "It's a mathematical construct that doesn't, it feels like intuition fails."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly and then use, like physicists, they're incredible intuition machines."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And then they'll play with this infinity as if they can play with it on the level of intuition as opposed to on the level of math."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "You know, yeah, maybe it's something cyclical you can imagine in infinity, just going around the same, kind of like a Mobius strip situation."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "But then the question then arises, how do you make it more or less infinite?"}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?"}, {"time": 1471, "text": "It's either some placeholder for infinity or it's one divided by a very, the smallest possible real number that you can represent in the memory."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Well, that's basically my undergraduate study in computer science is how to represent a floating point in a computer."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "I think I took 17 courses on this topic."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "It was very useful."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "I came to the right place."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "But in terms of what a physicist will mean, and you're right, I mean, physicists will blithely, nonchalantly subtract infinity, renormalization, and do things to get finite answers."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And it's miraculous."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "But at a certain point, you have to ask, well, what are the consequences for the real world?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "So one of them, you ask, what's the problem?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Does it make us more meaningless?"}, {"time": 1511, "text": "They purport, many of the people that support it, like Andrei Linde."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "In fact, Andrei Linde says, you have a bias."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "You, Lex, me, Brian."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "You have a bias that you believe in a universe."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "But shouldn't you believe in a multiverse?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "What evidence do you have that there's not a multiverse?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So he turns it around."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say, no, if anything can happen, then there's no predictive power within the theory."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "Because you
