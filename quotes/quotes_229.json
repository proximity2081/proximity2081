have these two books that are dated 1961, so I'm guessing my mother found them in a store in 62 or 63, How and Why Wonder Books."}, {"time": 309, "text": "How and Why Wonder Book of Electricity, and a How and Why Wonder Book of Giant Brains and Robots."}, {"time": 315, "text": "And I learned how to build circuits, you know, when I was eight or nine, simple circuits, and I read, you know, learned the binary system, and saw all these drawings, mostly, of robots, and then I tried to build them for the rest of my childhood."}, {"time": 336, "text": "Wait, 61, you said?"}, {"time": 338, "text": "This was when the two books, I've still got them at home."}, {"time": 341, "text": "What does the robot mean in that context?"}, {"time": 343, "text": "Some of the robots that they had were arms, you know, big arms to move nuclear material around, but they had pictures of welding robots that looked like humans under the sea, welding stuff underwater."}, {"time": 359, "text": "So they weren't real robots, but they were, you know, what people were thinking about for robots."}, {"time": 366, "text": "Were you thinking about humanoids?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "Were you thinking about arms with fingers?"}, {"time": 369, "text": "Were you thinking about faces or colors?"}, {"time": 372, "text": "Were you thinking about faces or cars?"}, {"time": 374, "text": "No, actually, to be honest, I realized my limitation on building mechanical stuff."}, {"time": 379, "text": "So I just built the brains, mostly, out of different technologies as I got older."}, {"time": 388, "text": "I built a learning system which was chemical based, and I had this ice cube tray."}, {"time": 395, "text": "Each well was a cell, and by applying voltage to the two electrodes, it would build up a copper bridge."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So over time, it would learn a simple network so I could teach it stuff."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And mostly, things were driven by my budget, and nails as electrodes and an ice cube tray was about my budget at that stage."}, {"time": 422, "text": "Later, I managed to buy transistors, and I could build gates and flip flops and stuff."}, {"time": 427, "text": "So one of your first robots was an ice cube tray?"}, {"time": 431, "text": "Yeah, it was very cerebral because it learned to add."}, {"time": 437, "text": "Well, just a decade or so before, in 1950, Alan Turing wrote a paper that formulated the Turing Test, and he opened that paper with the question, can machines think?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "Can your ice cube tray one day think?"}, {"time": 460, "text": "Certainly, machines can think because I believe you're a machine, and I'm a machine, and I believe we both think."}, {"time": 466, "text": "I think any other philosophical position is sort of a little ludicrous."}, {"time": 471, "text": "What does think mean if it's not something that we do?"}, {"time": 473, "text": "And we are machines."}, {"time": 476, "text": "So yes, machines can, but do we have a clue how to build such machines?"}, {"time": 480, "text": "That's a very different question."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Are we capable of building such machines?"}, {"time": 485, "text": "Are we smart enough?"}, {"time": 486, "text": "We think we're smart enough to do anything, but maybe we're not."}, {"time": 490, "text": "Maybe we're just not smart enough to build stuff like us."}, {"time": 494, "text": "The kind of computer that Alan Turing was thinking about, do you think there is something fundamentally or significantly different between the computer between our ears, the biological computer that humans use, and the computer that he was thinking about from a sort of high level philosophical?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "Yeah, I believe that it's very wrong."}, {"time": 516, "text": "In fact, I'm halfway through a, I think it'll be about a 480 page book, the working title is Not Even Wrong."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And if I may, I'll tell you a bit about that book."}, {"time": 528, "text": "So there's two, well, three thrusts to it."}, {"time": 532, "text": "One is the history of computation, what we call computation."}, {"time": 536, "text": "It goes all the way back to some manuscripts in Latin from 1614 and 1620 by Napier and Kepler through Babbage and Lovelace."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And then Turing's 1936 paper is what we think of as the invention of modern computation."}, {"time": 557, "text": "And that paper, by the way, did not set out to invent computation."}, {"time": 563, "text": "It set out to negatively answer one of Hilbert's three later set of problems."}, {"time": 569, "text": "He called it an effective way of getting answers."}, {"time": 578, "text": "And Hilbert really worked with rewriting rules, as did Church, who also, at the same time, a month earlier than Turing, disproved Hilbert's one of these three hypotheses."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Turing set out to disprove it, because it's always easier to disprove these things than to prove that there is an answer."}, {"time": 604, "text": "And so he needed, and it really came from his professor while I was an undergrad at Cambridge, who turned it into, is there a mechanical process?"}, {"time": 616, "text": "So he wanted to show a mechanical process that could calculate numbers, because that was a mechanical process that people used to generate tables."}, {"time": 627, "text": "They were called computers, the people at the time."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And they followed a set of rules where they had paper, and they would write numbers down, and based on the numbers, they'd keep writing other numbers."}, {"time": 639, "text": "And they would produce numbers for these tables, engineering tables, that the more iterations they did, the more significant digits came out."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And so Turing, in that paper, set out to define what sort of machine could do that, mechanical machine, where it could produce an arbitrary number of digits in the same way a human computer did."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And he came up with a very simple set of constraints where there was an infinite supply of paper."}, {"time": 674, "text": "This is the tape of the Turing machine, and each Turing machine came with a set of instructions that, as a person, could do with pencil and paper, write down things on the tape and erase them and put new things there."}, {"time": 690, "text": "And he was able to show that that system was not able to do something that Hilbert had hypothesized, so he disproved it."}, {"time": 698, "text": "But he had to show that this system was good enough to do whatever could be done, but couldn't do this other thing."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And there he said, and he says in the paper, I don't have any real arguments for this, but based on intuition."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So that's how he defined computation."}, {"time": 718, "text": "And then if you look over the next, from 1936 up until really around 1975, you see people struggling with, is this really what computation is?"}, {"time": 730, "text": "And so Marvin Minsky, very well known in AI, but also a fantastic mathematician, in his book Finite and Infant Machines from the mid-'60s, which is a beautiful, beautiful mathematical book, says at the start of the book, well, what is computation?"}, {"time": 746, "text": "Turing says it's this, and yeah, I sort of think it's that."}, {"time": 749, "text": "It doesn't really matter whether the stuff's made of wood or plastic."}, {"time": 752, "text": "It's just that relatively cheap stuff can do this stuff."}, {"time": 756, "text": "And so yeah, seems like computation."}, {"time": 760, "text": "And Donald Knuth, in his first volume of his Art of Computer Programming in around 1968, says, well, what's computation?"}, {"time": 772, "text": "It's this stuff, like Turing says, that a person could do each step without too much trouble."}, {"time": 777, "text": "And so one of his examples of what would be too much trouble was a step which required knowing whether Fermat's Last Theorem was true or not, because it was not known at the time."}, {"time": 788, "text": "And that's too much trouble for a person to do as a step."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And Hopcroft and Ullman sort of said a similar thing later that year."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And by 1975, in the A.H.O."}, {"time": 800, "text": "Hopcroft and Ullman book, they're saying, well, you know, we don't really know what computation is, but intuition says this is sort of about right, and this is what it is."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It's a sort of agreed upon thing which happens to be really easy to implement in silicon."}, {"time": 819, "text": "And then we had Moore's Law, which took off, and it's been an incredibly powerful tool."}, {"time": 824, "text": "I certainly wouldn't argue with that."}, {"time": 826, "text": "The version we have of computation, incredibly powerful."}, {"time": 829, "text": "Can we just take a pause?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "So what we're talking about is there's an infinite tape with some simple rules of how to write on that tape, and that's what we're kind of thinking about."}, {"time": 839, "text": "This is computation."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Yeah, and it's modeled after humans, how humans do stuff."}, {"time": 843, "text": "And I think it's, Turing says in the 36th paper, one of the critical facts here is that a human has a limited amount of memory."}, {"time": 851, "text": "So that's what we're going to put onto our mechanical computers."}, {"time": 855, "text": "So, you know, I'm like mass."}, {"time": 859, "text": "I'm like mass or charge or, you know, it's not given by the universe."}, {"time": 866, "text": "It was, this is what we're going to call computation."}, {"time": 869, "text": "And then it has this really, you know, it had this really good implementation, which has completely changed our technological world."}, {"time": 880, "text": "Second part of the book, or argument in the book, I have this two by two matrix with science."}, {"time": 888, "text": "In the top row, engineering in the bottom row, left column is intelligence, right column is life."}, {"time": 898, "text": "So in the bottom row, the engineering, there's artificial intelligence and artificial life."}, {"time": 903, "text": "In the top row, there's neuroscience and abiogenesis."}, {"time": 907, "text": "How does living matter turn in?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "How does nonliving matter become living matter?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "Four disciplines."}, {"time": 914, "text": "These four disciplines all came into the current form in the period 1945 to 1965."}, {"time": 924, "text": "There was neuroscience before, but it wasn't effective neuroscience."}, {"time": 928, "text": "It was, you know, there were these ganglia and there's electrical charges, but no one knows what to do with it."}, {"time": 933, "text": "And furthermore, there are a lot of players who are common across them."}, {"time": 938, "text": "I've identified common players except for artificial intelligence and abiogenesis."}, {"time": 943, "text": "I don't have, but for any other pair, I can point to people who work them."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And a whole bunch of them, by the way, were at the research lab for electronics at MIT where Warren McCulloch held forth."}, {"time": 958, "text": "In fact, McCulloch, Pitts, Letvin, and Maturana wrote the first paper on functional neuroscience called What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain, where instead of it just being this bunch of nerves, they sort of showed what different anatomical components were doing and telling other anatomical components and, you know, generating behavior in the frog."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Would you put them as basically the fathers or one of the early pioneers of what are now called artificial neural networks?"}, {"time": 993, "text": "Yeah, I mean, McCulloch and Pitts."}, {"time": 996, "text": "Pitts was a much younger than him."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It was picked up by John von Neumann when he was designing the Edbeck computer in 1945."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "He talked about its components being neurons based on, and in references, he's only got three references and one of them is the McCulloch Pitts paper."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "So all these people and then the AI people and the artificial life people, which was John von Neumann originally, there's like overlap between all, they're all going around the same time."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And three of these four disciplines turned to computation as their primary metaphor."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "So I've got a couple of chapters in the book."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "One is titled, wait, computers are people?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Because that's where our computers came from."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "And, you know, from people who were computing stuff."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "And then I've got another chapter, wait, people are computers?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "Which is about computational neuroscience."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "So there's this whole circle here."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And that computation is it."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And, you know, I have talked to people about, well, maybe it's not computation that goes on in the head."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Okay, well, when Elon Musk's rocket goes up, is it computing?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "Is that how it gets into orbit?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "By computing?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But we've got this idea, if you want to build an AI system, you write a computer program."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "Yeah, so the word computation very quickly starts doing a lot of work that it was not initially intended to do."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "It's the second and same if you talk about the universe as essentially performing a computation."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "Wolfram does this."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "He turns it into computation."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "You don't turn rockets into computation."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "By the way, when you say computation in our conversation, do you tend to think of computation narrowly in the way Turing thought of computation?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "It's gotten very, you know, squishy."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Squishy."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "But computation in the way Turing thinks about it and the way most people think about it actually fits very well with thinking like a hunter gatherer."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "There are places and there can be stuff in places and the stuff in places can change and it stays there until someone changes it."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And it's this metaphor of place and container, which, you know, is a combination of our place cells in our hippocampus and our cortex."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "But this is how we use metaphors for mostly to think about."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And when we get outside of our metaphor range, we have to invent tools which we can sort of switch on to use."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So calculus is an example of a tool."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "It can do stuff that our raw reasoning can't do, and we've got conventions of when you can use it or not."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "But sometimes, you know, people try to all the time, we always try to get physical metaphors for things, which is why quantum mechanics has been such a problem for a hundred years."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Because it's a particle."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "No, it's a wave."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "It's got to be something we understand."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "And I say, no, it's some weird mathematical logic that's different from those, but we want that metaphor."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Well, you know, I suspect that, you know, a hundred years or 200 years from now, neither quantum mechanics nor dark matter will be talked about in the same terms, you know, in the same way that Flogerson's theory eventually went away."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "Because it just wasn't an adequate explanatory metaphor, you know."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "That metaphor was the stuff, there is stuff in the burning, the burning is in the matter."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "As it turns out, the burning was outside the matter, it was the oxygen."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "So our desire for metaphor and combined with our limited cognitive capabilities gets us into trouble."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "That's my argument in this book."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Now, and people say, well, what is it then?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And I say, well, I wish I knew that, right, the book about that."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "But I, you know, I give some ideas."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "But so there's the three things."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Computation is sort of a particular thing we use."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Oh, can I tell you one beautiful thing, one beautiful thing I found?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So, you know, I used an example of a thing that's different from computation."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "You hit a drum and it vibrates, and there are some stationary points on the drum surface, you know, because the waves are going up and down the stationary points."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Now, you could compute them to arbitrary precision, but the drum just knows them."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "The drum doesn't have to compute."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "What was the very first computer program ever written by Ada Lovelace?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "To compute Bernoulli numbers, and the Bernoulli numbers are exactly what you need to find those stable points in the drum surface."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And there was a bug in the program."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "The arguments to divide were, I don't know, I don't know."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "The arguments to divide were reversed in one place."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And it still worked?"}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Well, no, she's never got to run it."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "They never built the analytical engine."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "She wrote the program without it, you know."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So the computation?"}, {"time": 1341, "text": "Computation is sort of, you know, a thing that's become dominant as a metaphor, but is it the right metaphor?"}, {"time": 1349, "text": "All three of these four fields adopted computation."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And, you know, a lot of it swirls around Warren McCulloch and all his students, and he funded a lot of people."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And our human metaphors, our limitations to human thinking, all play into this."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Those are the three themes of the book."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So I have a little to say about computation."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "So you're saying that there is a gap between the computer or the machine that performs computation and this machine that appears to have consciousness and intelligence."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Yeah, that piece of meat in your head."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "Piece of meat."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "And maybe it's not just the meat in your head, it's the rest of you too."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "I mean, you actually have a neural system in your gut."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "I tend to also believe, not believe, but we're now dancing around things we don't know, but I tend to believe other humans are important."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Like, so we're almost like, I just don't think we would ever have achieved the level of intelligence we have with other humans."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "I'm not saying so confidently, but I have an intuition that some of the intelligence is in the interaction."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "Yeah, and I think it seems to be very likely, again, this is speculation, but we, our species, and probably neanderthals to some extent, because you can find old bones where they seem to be counting on them by putting notches that were neanderthals, we are able to put some of our stuff outside our body into the world."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And then other people can share it."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And then we get these tools that become shared tools."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And so there's a whole coupling that would not occur in the single deep learning network, which was fed all of literature or something."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Yeah, the neural network can't step outside of itself."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "But is there some, can we explore this dark room a little bit and try to get at something?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "What is the magic?"}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Where does the magic come from in the human brain that creates the mind?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "What's your sense as scientists that try to understand it and try to build it?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "What are the directions it followed might be productive?"}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Is it creative, interactive robots?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Is it creating large deep neural networks that do like self supervised learning and just like we'll discover that when you make something large enough, some interesting things will emerge?"}, {"time": 1519, "text": "Is it through physics and chemistry, biology, like artificial life angle?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Like we'll sneak up in this four quadrant matrix that you mentioned."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Is there anything you're most, if you had to bet all your money, financial?"}, {"time": 1533, "text": "I wouldn't."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "So every intelligence we know, animal intelligence, dog intelligence, octopus intelligence, which is a very different sort of architecture from us."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "All the intelligences we know perceive the world in some way and then have action in the world, but they're able to perceive objects in a way which is actually pretty damn phenomenal and surprising."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "We tend to think that the box over here between us, which is a sound box, I think is a blue box, but blueness is something that we construct with color constancy."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "The blueness is not a direct function of the photons we're receiving."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "It's actually context, which is why you can turn, maybe seeing the examples where someone turns a stop sign into some other sort of sign by just putting a couple of marks on them and the deep learning system gets it wrong."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And everyone says, but the stop sign's red."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Why is it thinking it's the other sort of sign?"}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Because redness is not intrinsic in just the photons."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "It's actually a construction of an understanding of the whole world and the relationship between objects to get color constancy."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But our tendency, in order that we get an archive paper really quickly, is you just show a lot of data and give the labels and hope it figures it out."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "But it's not figuring it out in the same way we do."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "We have a very complex perceptual understanding of the world."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Dogs have a very different perceptual understanding based on smell."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "They go smell a post, they can tell how many different dogs have visited it in the last 10 hours and how long ago."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "There's all sorts of stuff that we just don't perceive about the world."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And just taking a single snapshot is not perceiving about the world."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "It's not seeing the registration between us and the object."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "And registration is a philosophical concept."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Brian Cantwell Smith talks about it a lot."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "Very difficult, squirmy thing to understand."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "But I think none of our systems do that."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "We've always talked in AI about the symbol grounding problem, how our symbols that we talk about are grounded in the world."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "And when deep learning came along and started labeling images, people said, ah, the grounding problem has been solved."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "No, the labeling problem was solved with some percentage accuracy, which is different from the grounding problem."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So you agree with Hans Marvick and what's called the Marvick's paradox that highlights this counterintuitive notion that reasoning is easy, but perception and mobility are hard."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "We shared an office when I was working on computer vision and he was working on his first mobile robot."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "What were those conversations like?"}, {"time": 1730, "text": "So do you still kind of, maybe you can elaborate, do you still believe this kind of notion that perception is really hard?"}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Like, can you make sense of why we humans have this poor intuition about what's hard and not?"}, {"time": 1744, "text": "Well, let me give us sort of another story."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "If you go back to the original teams working on AI from the late 50s into the 60s, and you go to the AI lab at MIT, who was it that was doing that?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "It was a bunch of really smart kids who got into MIT and they were intelligent."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "So what's intelligence about?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Well, the stuff they were good at, playing chess, doing integrals, that was hard stuff."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "But, you know, a baby could see stuff, that wasn't intelligent, anyone could do that, that's not intelligence."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And so, you know, there was this intuition that the hard stuff is the things they were good at and the easy stuff was the stuff that everyone could do."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And maybe I'm overplaying it a little bit, but I think there's an element of that."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Yeah, I
