simulation would be where I'd come down."}, {"time": 360, "text": "Going further, deeper into that direction, you've also described that world as psychedelia."}, {"time": 368, "text": "So on that topic, I'm curious about that world."}, {"time": 371, "text": "On the topic of psychedelic drugs, do you see those kinds of chemicals that modify our perception as a distortion of our perception of reality or a window into another reality?"}, {"time": 385, "text": "No, I think what I'd be saying is that we live in a distorted reality and then those kinds of drugs give us a different kind of distorted."}, {"time": 392, "text": "Different perspective."}, {"time": 394, "text": "They just give an alternate distortion."}, {"time": 395, "text": "And I think that what they really do is they give a distorted perception, which is a little bit more allied to daydreams or unconscious interests."}, {"time": 407, "text": "So if for some reason you're feeling unconsciously anxious at that moment and you take a psychedelic drug, you'll have a more pronounced, unpleasant experience."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And if you're feeling very calm or happy, you might have a good time."}, {"time": 421, "text": "But yeah, so if I'm saying we're starting from a premise, our starting point is we were already in the slightly psychedelic state."}, {"time": 430, "text": "What those drugs do is help you go further down an avenue or maybe a slightly different avenue, but that's all."}, {"time": 436, "text": "So in that movie, Annihilation, the shimmer, this alternate dreamlike state is created by, I believe perhaps, an alien entity."}, {"time": 449, "text": "Of course, everything is up to interpretation, right?"}, {"time": 452, "text": "But do you think there's, in our world, in our universe, do you think there's intelligent life out there?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "And if so, how different is it from us humans?"}, {"time": 462, "text": "Well, one of the things I was trying to do in Annihilation was to offer up a form of alien life that was actually alien, because it would often seem to me that in the way that in the way we would represent aliens in books or cinema or television, or any one of the sort of storytelling mediums, is we would always give them very humanlike qualities."}, {"time": 491, "text": "So they wanted to teach us about galactic federations, or they wanted to eat us, or they wanted our resources, like our water, or they want to enslave us, or whatever it happens to be."}, {"time": 501, "text": "But all of these are incredibly humanlike motivations."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And I was interested in the idea of an alien that was not in any way like us."}, {"time": 514, "text": "It didn't share."}, {"time": 516, "text": "Maybe it had a completely different clock speed."}, {"time": 518, "text": "Maybe it's way, so we're talking about, we're looking at each other, we're getting information, light hits our optic nerve, our brain makes the best guess of what we're doing."}, {"time": 529, "text": "Sometimes it's right, something, you know, the thing we were talking about before."}, {"time": 531, "text": "What if this alien doesn't have an optic nerve?"}, {"time": 534, "text": "Maybe its way of encountering the space it's in is wholly different."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Maybe it has a different relationship with gravity."}, {"time": 541, "text": "The basic laws of physics it operates under might be fundamentally different."}, {"time": 545, "text": "It could be a different time scale and so on."}, {"time": 547, "text": "Yeah, or it could be the same laws, could be the same underlying laws of physics."}, {"time": 552, "text": "You know, it's a machine created, or it's a creature created in a quantum mechanical way."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It just ends up in a very, very different place to the one we end up in."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So, part of the preoccupation with annihilation was to come up with an alien that was really alien and didn't give us, and it didn't give us and we didn't give it any kind of easy connection between human and the alien."}, {"time": 579, "text": "Because I think it was to do with the idea that you could have an alien that landed on this planet that wouldn't even know we were here."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And we might only glancingly know it was here."}, {"time": 589, "text": "There'd just be this strange point where the vent diagrams connected, where we could sense each other or something like that."}, {"time": 596, "text": "So in the movie, first of all, incredibly original view of what an alien life would be."}, {"time": 601, "text": "And in that sense, it's a huge success."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Let's go inside your imagination."}, {"time": 607, "text": "Did the alien, that alien entity know anything about humans when it landed?"}, {"time": 614, "text": "So the idea is you're basically an alien that life is trying to reach out to anything that might be able to hear its mechanism of communication."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Or was it simply, was it just basically their biologist exploring different kinds of stuff that you can find?"}, {"time": 632, "text": "But this is the interesting thing is, as soon as you say their biologist, you've done the thing of attributing human type motivations to it."}, {"time": 640, "text": "So I was trying to free myself from anything like that."}, {"time": 648, "text": "So all sorts of questions you might answer about this notional alien, I wouldn't be able to answer because I don't know what it was or how it worked."}, {"time": 657, "text": "You know, I had some rough ideas."}, {"time": 660, "text": "Like it had a very, very, very slow clock speed."}, {"time": 664, "text": "And I thought maybe the way it is interacting with this environment is a little bit like the way an octopus will change its color forms around the space that it's in."}, {"time": 675, "text": "So it's sort of reacting to what it's in to an extent, but the reason it's reacting in that way is indeterminate."}, {"time": 683, "text": "But it's so, but it's clock speed was slower than our human life clock speed or inter, but it's faster than evolution."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Faster than our evolution."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Yeah, given the 4 billion years it took us to get here, then yes, maybe it started at eight."}, {"time": 699, "text": "If you look at the human civilization as a single organism, in that sense, you know, this evolution could be us."}, {"time": 706, "text": "You know, the evolution of living organisms on earth could be just a single organism."}, {"time": 711, "text": "And it's kind of, that's its life, is the evolution process that eventually will lead to probably the heat death of the universe or something before that."}, {"time": 722, "text": "I mean, that's just an incredible idea."}, {"time": 725, "text": "So you almost don't know."}, {"time": 727, "text": "You've created something that you don't even know how it works."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Yeah, because anytime I tried to look into how it might work, I would then inevitably be attaching my kind of thought processes into it."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And I wanted to try and put a bubble around it."}, {"time": 744, "text": "I would say, no, this is alien in its most alien form."}, {"time": 749, "text": "I have no real point of contact."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So unfortunately I can't talk to Stanley Kubrick."}, {"time": 757, "text": "So I'm really fortunate to get a chance to talk to you."}, {"time": 761, "text": "On this particular notion, I'd like to ask it a bunch of different ways and we'll explore it in different ways, but do you ever consider human imagination, your imagination as a window into a possible future?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "And that what you're doing, you're putting that imagination on paper as a writer and then on screen as a director."}, {"time": 784, "text": "And that plants the seeds in the minds of millions of future and current scientists."}, {"time": 790, "text": "And so your imagination, you putting it down actually makes it as a reality."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So it's almost like a first step of the scientific method that you imagining what's possible in your new series with Ex Machina is actually inspiring thousands of 12 year olds, millions of scientists and actually creating the future view of imagine."}, {"time": 814, "text": "Well, all I could say is that from my point of view, it's almost exactly the reverse because I see that pretty much everything I do is a reaction to what scientists are doing."}, {"time": 830, "text": "I'm an interested lay person."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And I feel this individual, I feel that the most interesting area that humans are involved in is science."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I think art is very, very interesting, but the most interesting is science."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And science is in a weird place because maybe around the time Newton was alive, if a very, very interested lay person said to themselves, I want to really understand what Newton is saying about the way the world works with a few years of dedicated thinking, they would be able to understand the sort of principles he was laying out."}, {"time": 874, "text": "And I don't think that's true anymore."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I think that's stopped being true now."}, {"time": 877, "text": "So I'm pretty smart guy."}, {"time": 881, "text": "And if I said to myself, I want to really, really understand what is currently the state of quantum mechanics or string theory or any of the sort of branching areas of it, I wouldn't be able to."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I'd be intellectually incapable of doing it because to work in those fields at the moment is a bit like being an athlete."}, {"time": 903, "text": "I suspect you need to start when you're 12, you know?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "And if you start in your mid 20s, start trying to understand in your mid 20s, then you're just never going to catch up."}, {"time": 913, "text": "That's the way it feels to me."}, {"time": 915, "text": "So what I do is I try to make myself open."}, {"time": 919, "text": "So the people that you're implying maybe I would influence, to me, it's exactly the other way around."}, {"time": 925, "text": "These people are strongly influencing me."}, {"time": 928, "text": "I'm thinking they're doing something fascinating."}, {"time": 930, "text": "I'm concentrating and working as hard as I can to try and understand the implications of what they say."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And in some ways, often what I'm trying to do is disseminate their ideas into a means by which it can enter a public conversation."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So Ex Machina contains lots of name checks, all sorts of existing thought experiments, shadows on Plato's cave and Mary in the black and white room and all sorts of different longstanding thought processes about sentience or consciousness or subjectivity or gender or whatever it happens to be."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And then I'm trying to marshal that into a narrative to say, look, this stuff is interesting and it's also relevant and this is my best shot at it."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So I'm the one being influenced in my construction."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Of course you would say that because you're not even aware of your own."}, {"time": 993, "text": "That's probably what Kubrick would say too, right?"}, {"time": 1031, "text": "I certainly think that's true with 2001 A Space Odyssey."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "I think at its best, and if it fails."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It's true of that, yeah, it's true of that, definitely."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "At its best, it plans something."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "It's hard to describe it."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It inspires the next generation and it could be field dependent."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So your new series has more a connection to physics, quantum physics, quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and yet Ex Machina has more artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "I know more about AI."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "My sense that AI is much earlier in the depth of its understanding."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "I would argue nobody understands anything to the depth that physicists do about physics."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "In AI, nobody understands AI, that there is a lot of importance and role for imagination, which I think we're in that, where Freud imagined the subconscious, we're in that stage of AI, where there's a lot of imagination needed thinking outside the box."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "The spread of discussions and the spread of anxieties that exists about AI fascinate me."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "The way in which some people seem terrified about it whilst also pursuing it."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And I've never shared that fear about AI personally, but the way in which it agitates people and also the people who it agitates, I find kind of fascinating."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Are you afraid?"}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Are you excited?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Are you sad by the possibility, let's take the existential risk of artificial intelligence, by the possibility an artificial intelligence system becomes our offspring and makes us obsolete?"}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I mean, it's a huge subject to talk about, I suppose."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "But one of the things I think is that humans are actually very experienced at creating new life forms because that's why you and I are both here and it's why everyone on the planet is here."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And so something in the process of having a living thing that exists that didn't exist previously is very much encoded into the structures of our life and the structures of our societies."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Doesn't mean we always get it right, but it does mean we've learned quite a lot about that."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "We've learned quite a lot about what the dangers are of allowing things to be unchecked."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "And it's why we then create systems of checks and balances in our government and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I mean, that's not to say, the other thing is it seems like there's all sorts of things that you could put into a machine that you would not be."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So with us, we sort of roughly try to give some rules to live by and some of us then live by those rules and some don't."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And with a machine, it feels like you could enforce those things."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "So partly because of our previous experience and partly because of the different nature of a machine, I just don't feel anxious about it."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "More I just see all the good that, broadly speaking, the good that can come from it."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "But that's just where I am on that anxiety spectrum."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "You know, it's kind of, there's a sadness."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "So we as humans give birth to other humans, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But there's generations."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And there's often in the older generation, a sadness about what the world has become now."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "I mean, that's kind of... Yeah, there is, but there's a counterpoint as well, which is that most parents would wish for a better life for their children."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "So there may be a regret about some things about the past, but broadly speaking, what people really want is that things will be better for the future generations, not worse."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "And so, and then it's a question about what constitutes a future generation."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "A future generation could involve people."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "It also could involve machines and it could involve a sort of cross pollinated version of the two or any, but none of those things make me feel anxious."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "It doesn't give you anxiety."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "It doesn't excite you?"}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Like anything that's new?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Not anything that's new."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "I don't think, for example, I've got, my anxieties relate to things like social media that, so I've got plenty of anxieties about that."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Which is also driven by artificial intelligence in the sense that there's too much information to be able to, an algorithm has to filter that information and present to you."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So ultimately the algorithm, a simple, oftentimes simple algorithm is controlling the flow of information on social media."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So that's another form of AI."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "But at least my sense of it, I might be wrong, but my sense of it is that the algorithms have an either conscious or unconscious bias, which is created by the people who are making the algorithms and sort of delineating the areas to which those algorithms are gonna lean."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And so for example, the kind of thing I'd be worried about is that it hasn't been thought about enough how dangerous it is to allow algorithms to create echo chambers, say."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "But that doesn't seem to me to be about the AI or the algorithm."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "It's the naivety of the people who are constructing the algorithms to do that thing."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "If you see what I mean."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So in your new series, Devs, and we could speak more broadly, there's a, let's talk about the people constructing those algorithms, which in our modern society, Silicon Valley, those algorithms happen to be a source of a lot of income because of advertisements."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So let me ask sort of a question about those people."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Are current concerns and failures on social media, their naivety?"}, {"time": 1386, "text": "I can't pronounce that word well."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Are they naive?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Are they, I use that word carefully, but evil in intent or misaligned in intent?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "I think that's a, do they mean well and just go have an unintended consequence?"}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Or is there something dark in them that results in them creating a company results in that super competitive drive to be successful."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "And those are the people that will end up controlling the algorithms."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "At a guess, I'd say there are instances of all those things."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "So sometimes I think it's naivety."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Sometimes I think it's extremely dark."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And sometimes I think people are not being naive or dark."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And then in those instances are sometimes generating things that are very benign and other times generating things that despite their best intentions are not very benign."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "It's something, I think the reason why I don't get anxious about AI in terms of, or at least AIs that have, I don't know, a relationship with, some sort of relationship with humans is that I think that's the stuff we're quite well equipped to understand how to mitigate."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "The problem is issues that relate actually to the power of humans or the wealth of humans."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "And that's where it's dangerous here and now."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "So what I see, I'll tell you what I sometimes feel about Silicon Valley is that it's like Wall Street in the 80s."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "It's rabidly capitalistic, absolutely rabidly capitalistic and it's rabidly greedy."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "But whereas in the 80s, the sense one had of Wall Street was that these people kind of knew they were sharks and in a way relished in being sharks and dressed in sharp suits and kind of lorded over other people and felt good about doing it."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "Silicon Valley has managed to hide its voracious Wall Street like capitalism behind hipster T shirts and cool cafes in the place where they set up there."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "And so that obfuscates what's really going on and what's really going on is the absolute voracious pursuit of money and power."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "So that's where it gets shaky for me."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So that veneer and you explore that brilliantly, that veneer of virtue that Silicon Valley has."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Which they believe themselves, I'm sure for a long time."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Okay, I hope to be one of those people and I believe that."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "So as maybe a devil's advocate term, poorly used in this case, what if some of them really are trying to build a better world?"}, {"time": 1582, "text": "I'm sure I think some of them are."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I think I've spoken to ones who I believe in their heart feel they're building a better world."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Are they not able to?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "No, they may or may not be, but it's just as a zone with a lot of bullshit flying about."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And there's also another thing, which is this actually goes back to, I always thought about some sports that later turned out to be corrupt in the way that the sport, like who won the boxing match or how a football match got thrown or cricket match or whatever happened to be."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And I used to think, well, look, if there's a lot of money and there really is a lot of money, people stand to make millions or even billions, you will find a corruption that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So it's in the nature of its voracious appetite that some people will be corrupt and some people will exploit and some people will exploit whilst thinking they're doing something good."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "But there are also people who I think are very, very smart and very benign and actually very self aware."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "And so I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to wipe out the motivations of this entire area."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "But I do, there are people in that world who scare the hell out of me."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Yeah, I'm a little bit naive in that, like I don't care at all about money."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And so I'm a... You might be one of the good guys."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Yeah, but so the thought is, but I don't have money."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "So my thought is if you give me a billion dollars, I would, it would change nothing and I would spend it right away on investing it right back and creating a good world."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But your intuition is that billion, there's something about that money that maybe slowly corrupts the people around you."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "There's somebody gets in that corrupts your soul the way you view the world."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "Money does corrupt, we know that."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "But there's a different sort of problem aside from just the money corrupts thing that we're familiar with throughout history."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "And it's more about the sense of reinforcement an individual gets, which is so..."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "It effectively works like the reason I earned all this money and so much more money than anyone else is because I'm very gifted."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "I'm actually a bit smarter than they are, or I'm a lot smarter than they are, and I can see the future in the way they can't."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And maybe some of those people are not particularly smart, they're very lucky, or they're very talented entrepreneurs."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And there's a difference between..."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in other words, the acquisition of the money and power can suddenly start to feel like evidence of virtue."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And it's not evidence of virtue, it might be evidence of completely different things."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "That's brilliantly put, yeah."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "Yeah, that's brilliantly put."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So I think one of the fundamental drivers of my current morality... Let me just represent nerds in general of all kinds, is of constant self doubt and the signals..."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "I'm very sensitive to signals from people that tell me I'm doing the wrong thing."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "But when there's a huge inflow of money, you just put it brilliantly that that could become an overpowering signal that everything you do is right."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And so your moral compass can just get thrown off."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "Yeah, and that is not contained to Silicon Valley, that's across the board."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "In general, yeah."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Like I said, I'm from the Soviet Union, the current president is convinced, I believe, actually he wants to do really good by the country and by the world, but his moral compass may be off because... Yeah, I mean, it's the interesting thing about evil, which is that I think most people who do spectacularly evil things think themselves they're doing really good things."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "That they're not there thinking, I am a sort of incarnation of Satan."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "They're thinking, yeah, I've seen a way to fix the world and everyone else is wrong, here I go."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "In fact, I'm having a fascinating conversation with a historian of Stalin, and he took power."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "He actually got more power than almost any person in history."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "And he wanted, he didn't want power."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "He just wanted, he truly, and this is what people don't realize, he truly believed that communism will make for a better world."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And he wanted power."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "He wanted to destroy the competition to make sure that we actually make communism work in the Soviet Union and then spread across the world."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "He was trying to do good."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "I think it's typically the case that that's what people think they're doing."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And I think that, but you don't need to go to Stalin."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "I mean, Stalin, I think Stalin probably got pretty crazy, but actually that's another part of it, which is that the other thing that comes from being convinced of your own virtue is that then you stop listening to the modifiers around you."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "And that tends to

are in plain sight of each other and say now assess the consciousness."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "And the way it was illustrating the way in which you'd assess the state of consciousness of a machine

the building, she looks over her shoulder and she smiles."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And I thought after all the conversation about tests, in a way, the best indication you could have of the interior

whatever that sentience was."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Oh, that's really interesting, we don't get to observe Ava much or something like a smile in any context except through interaction, trying to convince others that she's conscious, that's beautiful."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "But it was a small, in a funny way, I think maybe people saw it as an evil smile, like, ha, I fooled them."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "But actually it was just a smile."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "And I thought, well, in the end, after all the conversations about the test, that was the answer to the test and then off she goes."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So if we align, if we just linger a little bit longer on Hal and Ava, do you think in terms of motivation, what was Hal's motivation?"}, {"time": 2271,

question."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "I'm gonna approach it slightly obliquely, which is that if a friend of yours got stabbed in a mugging, and you then felt very angry at the person who'd done the stabbing, but then you learned that it was a 15 year old and the 15 year old, both their parents were addicted to crystal meth and the kid had been addicted since he was 10."}, {"time": 2413, "text":

her moral views have some dark elements."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "But I like Ava personally, I like Ava."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Would you vote for her?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "I'm having difficulty finding anyone to vote for in my country or if I lived here in yours."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "So, that's a yes, I guess, because I'm not sure Yes, I guess, because of the competition."},

nobody there to hear it."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "But does the appearance from a robotics perspective of consciousness mean consciousness to you?"}, {"time": 2519, "text": "No, I don't think you could say that fully because I think you could then easily have a thought experiment which said, we will create something which we know is not conscious but is going to give a very, very good account of seeming conscious."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And so, and also it would be a particularly bad test where humans are involved because humans are so quick to project sentience into things that don't have sentience."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "So, someone could have their computer playing up and feel as if their computer is being malevolent to them when it clearly isn't."}, {"time": 2552, "text":

of it is that so the flip side of that, the argument there is because we just attribute consciousness to everything almost and anthropomorphize everything including Roombas, that maybe consciousness is not real, that we just attribute consciousness to each other."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So, you have a sense that there is something really special going on in our mind that makes us unique and

that."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "Yeah, so the idea that there is a thing that it would be like to be the sun."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "Yeah, no, I don't buy that."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I think that consciousness is a thing."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "My sort of broad modification is that usually the more I find out about things, the more illusory our instinct is and is leading us into a

high fraction of those went extinct."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "But if we think there are many, I mean, it's interesting, because there are certain things that possibly could kill us, like if you look at existential risks, and it might be a different, like the best answer to what would be most likely to kill us might be a different answer than the best answer to the question, if there is something that kills almost everyone, what would that be?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Because that would have to be some risk factor that was kind of uniform overall possible civilization."}, {"time": 1134,

about whether they should invest half of their GDP for this."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "It would more be like, well, if any little fraction of the civilization feels like doing this at any point

simulation?"}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Well, that would be the type of computer simulation that would contain people like those we think have lived on our planet in the past and like ourselves in

the simulated being has a brain, let's say that's simulated at a sufficient level of granularity that it would have the same subjective experiences as we have."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "So where does

not is not like whether it's built from organic biological neurons, but maybe something like what the structure of the computation is that it implements."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So we can discuss that if we want, but I think it would be more forward as far as my view that it would be sufficient, say, if you had a computation that was identical to the computation in the human brain down to the level of neurons."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So if you had a simulation with 100 billion neurons connected in the same way as the human brain, and you then roll that forward with the same kind of synaptic weights and so forth, so you actually had the same behavior coming out of this as a human with that brain would have done, then I think that would be conscious."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Now it's possible you could also generate consciousness without having that detailed assimilation, there I'm getting more uncertain exactly how much you could simplify or abstract away."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "Can you look on that?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "I missed where you're placing consciousness in the second."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Well, so if you are a computationalist, do you think that what creates consciousness is the implementation of a computation?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Some property, emergent property of the computation itself."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Yeah, you could say that."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "But then the question is, what's the class of computations such that when they are run, consciousness emerges?"}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So if you just have something that adds one plus one plus one plus one, like a simple computation, you think maybe that's not going to have any consciousness."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "If on the other hand, the computation is one like our human brains are performing, where as part of the computation, there is a global workspace, a sophisticated attention mechanism, there is self representations of other cognitive processes and a whole lot of other things that possibly would be conscious."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "And in fact, if it's exactly like ours, I think definitely it would."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "But exactly how much less than the full computation that the human brain is performing would be required is a little bit, I think, of an open question."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "He asked another interesting question as well, which is, would it be sufficient to just have say the brain or would you need the environment in order to generate the same kind of experiences that we have?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And there is a bunch of stuff we don't know."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "I mean, if you look at, say, current virtual reality environments, one thing that's clear is that we don't have to simulate all details of them all the time in order for, say, the human player to have the perception that there is a full reality and that you can have say procedurally generated where you might only render a scene when it's actually within the view of the player character."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And so similarly, if this environment that we perceive is simulated, it might be that all of the parts that come into our view are rendered at any given time."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And a lot of aspects that never come into view, say the details of this microphone I'm talking into, exactly what each atom is doing at any given point in time, might not be part of the simulation, only a more coarse grained representation."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So that to me is actually from an engineering perspective, why the simulation hypothesis is really interesting to think about is how difficult is it to fake sort of in a virtual reality context, I don't know if fake is the right word, but to construct a reality that is sufficiently real to us to be immersive in the way that the physical world is."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "I think that's actually probably an answerable question of psychology, of computer science, of how, where's the line where it becomes so immersive that you don't want to leave that world?"}, {"time": 1627, "text": "Yeah, or that you don't realize while you're in it that it is a virtual world."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "Yeah, those are two actually questions, yours is the more sort of the good question about the realism, but mine, from my perspective, what's interesting is it doesn't have to be real, but how can we construct a world that we wouldn't want to leave?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think that might be too low a bar, I mean, if you think, say when people first had pong or something like that, I'm sure there were people who wanted to keep playing it for a long time because it was fun and they wanted to be in this little world."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I'm not sure we would say it's immersive, I mean, I guess in some sense it is, but like an absorbing activity doesn't even have to be."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "But they left that world though, that's the thing."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So like, I think that bar is deceivingly high."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So they eventually left, so you can play pong or Starcraft or whatever more sophisticated games for hours, for months, you know, while the work has to be in a big addiction, but eventually they escaped that."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So you mean when it's absorbing enough that you would spend your entire, you would choose to spend your entire life in there."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And then thereby changing the concept of what reality is, because your reality becomes the game."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Not because you're fooled, but because you've made that choice."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Yeah, and it made, different people might have different preferences regarding that."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Some might, even if you had any perfect virtual reality, might still prefer not to spend the rest of their lives there."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I mean, in philosophy, there's this experience machine, thought experiment."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "Have you come across this?"}, {"time": 1735, "text": "So Robert Nozick had this thought experiment where you imagine some crazy super duper neuroscientist of the future have created a machine that could give you any experience you want if you step in there."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And for the rest of your life, you can kind of pre programmed it in different ways."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So your fun dreams could come true, you could, whatever you dream, you want to be a great artist, a great lover, like have a wonderful life, all of these things."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "If you step into the experience machine will be your experiences, constantly happy."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "But you would kind of disconnect from the rest of reality and you would float there in a tank."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And so Nozick thought that most people would choose not to enter the experience machine."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "I mean, many might want to go there for a holiday, but they wouldn't want to have to check out of existence permanently."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "And so he thought that was an argument against certain views of value according to what we value is a function of what we experience."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "Because in the experience machine, you could have any experience you want, and yet many people would think that would not be much value."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "So therefore, what we value depends on other things than what we experience."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "So okay, can you can you take that argument further?"}, {"time": 1821, "text": "What about the fact that maybe what we value is the up and down of life?"}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So you could have up and downs in the experience machine, right?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "But what can't you have in the experience machine?"}, {"time": 1831, "text": "Well, I mean, that then becomes an interesting question to explore."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "But for example, real connection with other people, if the experience machine is a solo machine where it's only you, like that's something you wouldn't have there."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "You would have this subjective experience that would be like fake people."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "But when if you gave somebody flowers, there wouldn't be anybody there who actually got happy."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "It would just be a little simulation of somebody smiling."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "But the simulation would not be the kind of simulation I'm talking about in the simulation argument where the simulated creature is conscious, it would just be a kind of smiley face that would look perfectly real to you."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So we're now drawing a distinction between appear to be perfectly real and actually being real."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "Um, so that could be one thing, I mean, like a big impact on history, maybe is also something you won't have if you check into this experience machine."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So some people might actually feel the life I want to have for me is one where I have a big positive impact on history unfolds."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So you could kind of explore these different possible explanations for why it is you wouldn't want to go into the experience machine if that's, if that's what you feel."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And one interesting observation regarding this Nozick thought experiment and the conclusions he wanted to draw from it is how much is a kind of a status quo effect."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So a lot of people might not want to get this on current reality to plug into this dream machine."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So if the status quo was that they were actually in the experience machine, I think a lot of people might then prefer to live the life that they are familiar with rather than sort of bail out into."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "So that's interesting, the change itself, the leap, yeah, so it might not be so much the reality itself that we're after."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "But it's more that we are maybe involved in certain projects and relationships."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "And we have, you know, a self identity and these things that our values are kind of connected with carrying that forward."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "And then whether it's inside a tank or outside a tank in Peru, or whether inside a computer outside a computer, that's kind of less important to what we ultimately care about."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Yeah, but still, so just to linger on it, it is interesting."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "I find maybe people are different, but I find myself quite willing to take the leap to the farmer in Peru, especially as the virtual reality system become more realistic."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "I find that possibility and I think more people would take that leap."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "But so in this thought experiment, just to make sure we are understanding, so in this case, the farmer in Peru would not be a virtual reality, that would be the real, your life, like before this whole experience machine started."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Well, I kind of assumed from that description, you're being very specific, but that kind of idea just like washes away the concept of what's real."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "I'm still a little hesitant about your kind of distinction between real and illusion."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "Because when you can have an illusion that feels, I mean, that looks real, I don't know how you can definitively say something is real or not, like what's a good way to prove that something is real in that context?"}, {"time": 2077, "text": "Well, so I guess in this case, it's more a stipulation."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "In one case, you're floating in a tank with these wires by the super duper neuroscientists plugging into your head, giving you like Friedman experiences."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "In the other, you're actually tilling the soil in Peru, growing peanuts, and then those peanuts are being eaten by other people all around the world who buy the exports."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "That's two different possible situations in the one and the same real world that you could choose to occupy."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "But just to be clear, when you're in a vat with wires and the neuroscientists, you can still go farming in Peru, right?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "No, well, if you wanted to, you could have the experience of farming in Peru, but there wouldn't actually be any peanuts grown."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "But what makes a peanut, so a peanut could be grown and you could feed things with that peanut and why can't all of that be done in a simulation?"}, {"time": 2141, "text": "I hope, first of all, that they actually have peanut farms in Peru, I guess we'll get a lot of comments otherwise from Angrit."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "I was way up to the point when you started talking about Peru peanuts, that's when I realized you're relying out of these."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "In that climate."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "No, I mean, I think, I mean, in the simulation, I think there is a sense, the important sense in which it would all be real."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Nevertheless, there is a distinction between inside the simulation and outside the simulation."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "Or in the case of Nozick's thought experiment, whether you're in the vat or outside the vat, and some of those differences may or may not be important."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "I mean, that comes down to your values and preferences."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "So if the, if the experience machine only gives you the experience of growing peanuts, but you're the only one in the experience machines."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "No, but there's other, you can, within the experience machine, others can plug in."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "Well, there are versions of the experience machine."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "So in fact, you might want to have, distinguish different thought experiments, different versions of it."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "So in, like in the original thought experiment, maybe it's only you, right?"}, {"time": 2211, "text": "And you think, I wouldn't want to go in there."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "Well, that tells you something interesting about what you value and what you care about."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Then you could say, well, what if you add the fact that there would be other people in there and you would interact with them?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Well, it starts to make it more attractive, right?"}, {"time": 2226, "text": "Then you could add in, well, what if you could also have important longterm effects on human history and the world, and you could actually do something useful, even though you were in there."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "That makes it maybe even more attractive."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "Like you could actually have a life that had a purpose and consequences."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And so as you sort of add more into it, it becomes more similar to the baseline reality that you were comparing it to."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Yeah, but I just think inside the experience machine and without taking those steps you just mentioned, you still have an impact on longterm history of the creatures that live inside that, of the quote unquote fake creatures that live inside that experience machine."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And that, like at a certain point, you know, if there's a person waiting for you inside that experience machine, maybe your newly found wife and she dies, she has fear, she has hopes, and she exists in that machine when you plug out, when you unplug yourself and plug back in, she's still there going on about her life."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "Well, in that case, yeah, she starts to have more of an independent existence."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "Independent existence."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "But it depends, I think, on how she's implemented in the experience machine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "Take one limit case where all she is is a static picture on the wall, a photograph."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So you think, well, I can look at her, right?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "But that's it."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "There's no... Then you think, well, it doesn't really matter much what happens to that, any more than a normal photograph if you tear it up, right?"}, {"time": 2325, "text": "It means you can't see it anymore, but you haven't harmed the person whose picture you tore up."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "But if she's actually implemented, say, at a neural level of detail so that she's a fully realized digital mind with the same behavioral repertoire as you have, then very plausibly she would be a conscious person like you are."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And then what you do in this experience machine would have real consequences for how this other mind felt."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "So you have to specify which of these experience machines you're talking about."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "I think it's not entirely obvious that it would be possible to have an experience machine that gave you a normal set of human experiences, which include experiences of interacting with other people, without that also generating consciousnesses corresponding to those other people."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "That is, if you create another entity that you perceive and interact with, that to you looks entirely realistic."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Not just when you say hello, they say hello back, but you have a rich interaction, many days, deep conversations."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "It might be that the only possible way of implementing that would be one that also has a side effect, instantiated this other person in enough detail that you would have a second consciousness there."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "I think that's to some extent an open question."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "So you don't think it's possible to fake consciousness and fake intelligence?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Well, it might be."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "I mean, I think you can certainly fake, if you have a very limited interaction with somebody, you could certainly fake that."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "If all you have to go on is somebody said hello to you, that's not enough for you to tell whether that was a real person there, or a prerecorded message, or a very superficial simulation that has no consciousness, because that's something easy to fake."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "We could already fake it, now you can record a voice recording."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Yeah, I'm with you on the intelligence part, but is there something about me that says consciousness is easier to fake?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "Like I've recently gotten my hands on a lot of rubas, don't ask me why or how."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "And I've made them, there's just a nice robotic mobile platform for experiments."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "And I made them scream and or moan in pain, so on, just to see when they're responding to me."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And it's just a sort of psychological experiment on myself."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And I think they appear conscious to me pretty quickly."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "To me, at least my brain can be tricked quite easily."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I said if I introspect, it's harder for me to be tricked that something is intelligent."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So I just have this feeling that inside this experience machine, just saying that you're conscious and having certain qualities of the interaction, like being able to suffer, like being able to hurt, like being able to wander about the essence of your own existence, not actually, I mean, creating the illusion that you're wandering about it is enough to create the illusion of consciousness."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And because of that, create a really immersive experience to where you feel like that is the real world."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "So you think there's a big gap between appearing conscious and being conscious?"}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Or is it that you think it's very easy to be conscious?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "I'm not actually sure what it means to be conscious."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "All I'm saying is the illusion of consciousness is enough to create a social interaction that's as good as if the thing was conscious, meaning I'm making it about myself."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "I mean, I guess there are a few different things."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "One is how good the interaction is, which might, I mean, if you don't really care about like probing hard for whether the thing is conscious, maybe it would be a satisfactory interaction, whether or not you really thought it was conscious."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "Now, if you really care about it being conscious in like inside this experience machine, how easy would it be to fake it?"}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And you say, it sounds fairly easy, but then the question is, would that also mean it's very easy to instantiate consciousness?"}, {"time": 2610, "text": "Like it's much more widely spread in the world and we have thought it doesn't require a big human brain with a hundred billion neurons, all you need is some system that exhibits basic intentionality and can respond and you already have consciousness."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Like in that case, I guess you still have a close coupling."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "I guess that case would be where they can come apart, where you could create the appearance of there being a conscious mind with actually not being another conscious mind."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "I'm somewhat agnostic exactly where these lines go."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "I think one observation that makes it plausible that you could have very realistic appearances relatively simply, which also is relevant for the simulation argument and in terms of thinking about how realistic would a virtual reality model have to be in order for the simulated creature not to notice that anything was awry."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Well, just think of our own humble brains during the wee hours of the night when we are dreaming."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "Many times, well, dreams are very immersive, but often you also don't realize that you're in a dream."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And that's produced by simple primitive three pound lumps of neural matter effortlessly."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "So if a simple brain like this can create the virtual reality that seems pretty real to us, then how much easier would it be for a super intelligent civilization with planetary sized computers optimized over the eons to create a realistic environment for you to interact with?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "By the way, behind that intuition is that our brain is not that impressive relative to the possibilities of what technology could bring."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "It's also possible that the brain is the epitome, is the ceiling."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "Meaning like this is the smartest possible thing that the universe could create."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "So that seems unlikely to me."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "I mean, for some of these reasons we alluded to earlier in terms of designs we already have for computers that would be faster by many orders of magnitude than the human brain."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "We can see that the constraints, the cognitive constraints in themselves is what enables the intelligence."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "So the more powerful you make the computer, the less likely it is to become super intelligent."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "This is where I say dumb things to push back on that statement."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "I'm not sure I thought that we might."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I mean, so there are different dimensions of intelligence."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "A simple one is just speed."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "Like if you can solve the same challenge faster in some sense, you're like smarter."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "So there I think we have very strong evidence for thinking that you could have a computer in this universe that would be much faster than the human brain and therefore have speed super intelligence, like be completely superior, maybe a million times faster."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "Then maybe there are other ways in which you could be smarter as well, maybe more qualitative ways, right?"}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And the concepts are a little bit less clear cut."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So it's harder to make a very crisp, neat, firmly logical argument for why that could be qualitative super intelligence as opposed to just things that were faster."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Although I still think it's very plausible and for various reasons that are less than watertight arguments."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "But when you can sort of, for example, if you look at animals and even within humans, like there seems to be like Einstein versus random person, like it's not just that Einstein was a little bit faster, but like how long would it take a normal person to invent general relativity is like, it's not 20% longer than it took Einstein or something like that."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "It's like, I don't know whether they would do it at all or it would take millions of years or some totally bizarre."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "But your intuition is that the compute size will get you go increasing the size of the computer and the speed of the computer might create some much more powerful levels of intelligence that would enable some of the things we've been talking about with like the simulation, being able to simulate an ultra realistic environment, ultra realistic perception of reality."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "I mean, strictly speaking, it would not be necessary to have super intelligence in order to have say the technology to make these simulations, ancestor simulations or other kinds of simulations."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "As a matter of fact, I think if we are in a simulation, it would most likely be one built by a civilization that had super intelligence."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "It certainly would help a lot."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "I mean, you could build more efficient larger scale structures if you had super intelligence."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "I also think that if you had the technology to build these simulations, that's like a very advanced technology."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "It seems kind of easier to get the technology to super intelligence."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I'd expect by the time they could make these fully realistic simulations of human history with human brains in there, like before that they got to that stage, they would have figured out how to create machine super intelligence or maybe biological enhancements of their own brains if there were biological creatures to start with."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So we talked about the three parts of the simulation argument."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "One, we destroy ourselves before we ever create the simulation."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "Two, we somehow, everybody somehow loses interest in creating the simulation."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Three, we're living in a simulation."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So you've kind of, I don't know if your thinking has evolved on this point, but you kind of said that we know so little that these three cases might as well be equally probable."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "So probabilistically speaking, where do you stand on this?"}, {"time": 2971, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I don't think equal necessarily would be the most supported probability assignment."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "So how would you, without assigning actual numbers, what's more or less likely in your view?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Well, I mean, I've historically tended to punt on the question of like between these three."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "So maybe you ask me another way is which kind of things would make each of these more or less likely?"}, {"time": 3003, "text": "What kind of intuition?"}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Certainly in general terms, if you think anything that say increases or reduces the probability of one of these, we tend to slosh probability around on the other."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "So if one becomes less probable, like the other would have to, cause it's got to add up to one."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "So if we consider the first hypothesis, the first alternative that there's this filter that makes it so that virtually no civilization reaches technological maturity, in particular our own civilization, if that's true, then it's like very unlikely that we would reach technological maturity because if almost no civilization at our stage does it, then it's unlikely that we do it."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So hence..."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Sorry, can you linger on that for a second?"}, {"time": 3051, "text": "Well, so if it's the case that almost all civilizations at our current stage of technological development failed to reach maturity, that would give us very strong reason for thinking we will fail to reach technological maturity."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Oh, and also sort of the flip side of that is the fact that we've reached it means that many other civilizations have reached this point."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So that means if we get closer and closer to actually reaching technological maturity, there's less and less distance left where we could go extinct before we are there, and therefore the probability that we will reach increases as we get closer, and that would make it less likely to be true that almost all civilizations at our current stage failed to get there."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "Like we would have this..."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "The one case we had started ourselves would be very close to getting there, that would be strong evidence that it's not so hard to get to technological maturity."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So to the extent that we feel we are moving nearer to

superintelligence might still attain technological maturity."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "Oh, I see, so you're not human exclusive."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "This could be any intelligent species that achieves, like it's all about the technological maturity."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "But the humans have to attain it."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So like superintelligence could replace us and that's just as well for the simulation argument."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "I mean, it could interact with the second hypothesis by alternative."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "Like if the thing that replaced us was either more likely or less likely than we would be to have an interest in creating ancestor simulations, you know, that could affect probabilities."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "But yeah, to a first order, like if we all just die, then yeah, we won't produce any simulations because we are dead."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "But if we all die and get replaced by some other intelligent thing that then gets to technological maturity, the question remains, of course, if not that thing, then use some of its resources to do this stuff."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So can you reason about this stuff,

disagree, but to me, it's not trivial to figure out how difficult it is to build a simulation."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "We kind of talked about it a little bit."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "We also don't know, like as we try to start building it, like start creating virtual worlds and so on, how that changes the fabric of society."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "Like, is it still possible to reason

of people."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "Is that the incorrect place for it to go?"}, {"time": 3417, "text": "Well, not necessarily."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "I think the second alternative, which has to do with the motivations and interests of technological and material civilizations, I think there is much we don't understand about that."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "Can you talk about that a little bit?"}, {"time": 3439, "text": "I mean, this is a question that pops up when you when you build an AGI system or build a general intelligence."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "How does that change our motivations?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Do you think it'll fundamentally transform our motivations?"}, {"time": 3486, "text": "There are other things as well."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "So at the moment, we have not perfect control over our own being our own mental states, our own experiences are not under our direct control."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "So for example, if if you want to experience a pleasure and happiness, you might have to do a whole host of things in the external world to try to get into the stage into the mental state where you experience pleasure, like some people get some pleasure from eating great food."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "Well, they can just turn that on, they have to kind of actually go to a nice restaurant and then they have to make money."},

do that is by a whole host of complicated activities in the external world."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "Now, at some level of technological development, I think we'll become auto potent in the sense of gaining direct ability to choose our own internal configuration, and enough knowledge and insight to be able to actually do that in a meaningful way."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "So then it could turn out that there are a lot of instrumental goals that would drop out of the picture and be replaced by other instrumental goals, because we could now serve some of these final goals in more direct ways."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "And who knows how all of that shakes out after civilizations reflect on that and converge on different attractors and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3589, "text":

something or not to do something, then we just don't realize they are there because we are so dumb, bumbling through the universe."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "Because at this time, with our limited

this book, I think in 96."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "And there are some other versions as well by Richard Gott, who's a physicist, but let's focus on the Carter Leslie version where it's an argument

good."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "So maybe it's easiest to explain via an analogy to sampling from urns."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "So imagine you have two urns in front of you and they have balls in them that have numbers."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "The two urns look the same, but inside one there are 10 balls."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "Ball number one, two, three, up to ball number 10."},

the 10 ball urn and you say, well, 50, 50, I can't tell which urn it is."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "But then you're allowed to reach in and pick a ball at random from the urn and that's suppose you find that it's ball number seven."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "So that's strong evidence for the 10 ball hypothesis."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "It's a lot more likely that you would get such a low numbered ball if there are only 10 balls in the urn, like it's in fact 10% done, right?"}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Then if there are a million balls, it would be very unlikely you would get number seven."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "So you perform a Bayesian update and if your prior was 50, 50 that it was the 10 ball urn, you become virtually certain after finding the random sample was seven that it's only has 10 balls in it."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "So in the case of the urns, this is uncontroversial, just elementary probability theory."}, {"time": 4117, "text": "The Doomsday Argument says that you should reason in a similar way with respect to different hypotheses about how many balls there will be in the urn of humanity as it were, how many humans there will ever have been by the time we go extinct."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "So to simplify, let's suppose we only consider two hypotheses, either maybe 200 billion humans in total or 200 trillion humans in total."}, {"time": 4145,

start with some prior based on ordinary empirical ideas about threats to civilization and so forth."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "And maybe you say it's a 5% chance that we will go extinct by the time

on where you started counting, like which ancestors was human enough to count as human."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "But those are not really important, there are relatively few of them."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So yeah, so you're roughly 100 billion."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "Now, if they're only going to be 200 billion in total, that's a perfectly unremarkable number."}, {"time": 4221,

you would be remarkably early, like what are the chances out of these 200 trillion human that you should be human number 100 billion?"}, {"time": 4240, "text": "That seems it would have a much lower conditional probability."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And so analogously to how in the urn case, you thought after finding this low numbered random sample, you update it in favor of the urn having few balls."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "Similarly, in this case, you should update in favor of the human species having a lower total number of members that is doomed soon."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "You said doomed soon?"}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Well, that would be the hypothesis in this case that it will end 100 billion."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "I just like that term for that hypothesis."},

existed."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "If you have that assumption, then I think the rest kind of follows."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "The question then is, why should you make that assumption?"}, {"time": 4294, "text": "In fact, you know you're 100 billion, so where do you get this prior?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And then there is like a literature on that with different ways of supporting that assumption."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "That's just one example of anthropic reasoning, right?"}, {"time": 4308, "text": "That seems to be kind of convenient when you think about humanity, when you think about sort of even like existential threats and so on, as it seems that quite naturally that you should assume that you're just an average case."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "Yeah, that you're kind of a typical randomly sample."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Now, in the case of the Doomsday Argument, it seems to lead to what intuitively we think is the wrong conclusion, or at least many people have this reaction that there's got to be something fishy about this argument."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "Because from very, very weak premises, it gets this very striking implication that we have almost no chance of reaching size 200 trillion humans in the future."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "And how could we possibly get there just by reflecting on when we were born?"}, {"time": 4355, "text": "It seems you would need sophisticated arguments about the impossibility of space colonization, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So one might be tempted to reject this key assumption, I call it the self sampling assumption, the idea that you should reason as if you're a random sample from all observers or in your some reference class."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "However, it turns out that in other domains, it looks like we need something like this self sampling assumption to make sense of bona fide scientific inferences."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "In contemporary cosmology, for example, you have these multiverse theories."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And according to a lot of those, all possible human observations are made."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "So if you have a sufficiently large universe, you will have a lot of people observing all kinds of different things."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "So if you have two competing theories, say about the value of some constant, it could be true according to both of these theories that there will be some observers observing the value that corresponds to the other theory, because there will be some observers that have hallucinations, so there's a local fluctuation or a statistically anomalous measurement, these things will happen."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "And if enough observers make enough different observations, there will be some that sort of by chance make these different ones."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "And so what we would want to say is, well, many more observers, a larger proportion of the observers will observe as it were the true value."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "And a few will observe the wrong value."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "If we think of ourselves as a random sample, we should expect with a probability to observe the true value and that will then allow us to conclude that the evidence we actually have is evidence for the theories we think are supported."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "It kind of then is a way of making sense of these inferences that clearly seem correct, that we can make various observations and infer what the temperature of the cosmic background is and the fine structure constant and all of this."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "But it seems that without rolling in some assumption similar to the self sampling assumption, this inference just doesn't go through."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "And there are other examples."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "So there are these scientific contexts where it looks like this kind of anthropic reasoning is needed and makes perfect sense."},

then this project that would consist in trying to figure out what are the legitimate ways of reasoning about these indexical facts when observer selection effects are in play."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "In other words, developing a theory of anthropics."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "And there are different views of looking at that and it's a difficult methodological area."}, {"time": 4529,

if you think about, in the case of the Dupest argument, it says you should reason as if you are a random sample from all humans that will have lived, even though in fact you know that you are about number 100 billionth human and you're alive in the year 2020."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "Whereas in the case of the simulation argument, it says that, well, if you actually have no way of telling which one you are, then you should assign this kind of uniform probability."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "Yeah, yeah, your role as the observer in the simulation argument is different, it seems like."},

the simulation argument, the relevant observers would be A, the people in original histories, and B, the people in simulations."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "So this would be the class of observers that we need, I mean, they're also maybe the simulators, but we can set those aside for this."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "So the question is, given that class of observers, a small set of original history observers and a large class of simulated observers, which one should you think is you?"}, {"time": 4611, "text": "Where are you amongst this set of observers?"}, {"time": 4614, "text": "I'm maybe

mentioned."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "I mean, does it have to be..."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "It's not the observer."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it may be an easier way of putting it is just like, are you simulated, are you not simulated, given this assumption that these two groups of people exist?"}, {"time": 4642, "text": "In the simulation case, it seems pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "So the key point is the methodological assumption you need to make to get the simulation argument to where it wants to go is much weaker and less problematic than the methodological assumption you need to make to get the doomsday argument to its conclusion."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "Maybe the doomsday argument is sound or unsound, but you need to make a much stronger and more controversial assumption to make it go through."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "In the case of the simulation argument, I guess one maybe way intuition pumped to support this bland principle of indifference is to consider a sequence of different cases where the fraction of people who are simulated to non simulated approaches one."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "So in the limiting case where everybody is simulated, obviously you can deduce with certainty that you are simulated."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "If everybody with your experiences is simulated and you know you've got to be one of those, you don't need a probability at all, you just kind of logically conclude it, right?"}, {"time": 4716, "text": "So then as we move from a case where say 90% of everybody is simulated, 99%, 99.9%, it should seem plausible that the probability you assign should sort of approach one certainty as the fraction approaches the case where everybody is in a simulation."}, {"time": 4742,

one."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "In reality, that would be some ratio, although maybe a technologically mature civilization could run a lot of simulations using a small portion of its resources, it probably wouldn't be able to run infinitely many."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "I mean, if we take say the observed, the physics in the observed universe, if we assume that that's also the physics at the level of the simulators, that would be limits to the amount of information processing that any one civilization could perform in its future trajectory."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "First of all, there's limited amount of matter you can get your hands off because with a positive cosmological constant, the universe is accelerating, there's like a finite sphere of stuff, even if you traveled with the speed of light that you could ever reach, you have a finite amount of stuff."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "And then if you think there is like a lower limit to the amount of loss you get when you perform an erasure of a computation, or if you think, for example, just matter gradually over cosmological timescales, decay, maybe protons decay, other things, and you radiate out gravitational waves, like there's all kinds of seemingly unavoidable losses that occur."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Eventually, we'll have something like a heat death of the universe or a cold death or whatever, but yeah."},

couldn't there be like an arbitrary number of simulation that spawned ours, and those had more resources, in terms of physical universe to work with?"}, {"time": 4886, "text": "Sorry, what do you mean that that could be?"}, {"time": 4889, "text": "Sort of, okay, so if simulations spawn other simulations, it seems like each new spawn has fewer resources to work with."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "But we don't know at which step along the way we are at."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "Any one observer doesn't know whether we're in level 42, or 100, or one, or is that not matter for the resources?"},

in basement reality where all these simulations with the simulations with the simulations are taking place, like that computer, ultimately, it's CPU or whatever it is, like that has to power this whole tower, right?"}, {"time": 4960, "text": "So if there is a finite compute power in basement reality, that would impose a limit to how tall this tower can be."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "And if

you said, it comes up every once in a while, some new community discovers it and so on."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "But I would say one of the biggest popularizers of this idea is Elon Musk."},

Elon, so there's like the standard arguments for why you might want to take the simulation hypothesis seriously, the simulation argument, right?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "In the case that if you are actually Elon Musk, let us say, there's a kind of an additional reason in that what are the chances you would be Elon Musk?"}, {"time": 5057, "text": "It seems like maybe there would be more interest in simulating the lives of very unusual and remarkable people."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "So if you consider not just simulations where all of human history or the whole of human civilization are simulated, but also other kinds of simulations, which only include some subset of people, like in those simulations that only include a subset, it might be more likely that they would include subsets of people with unusually interesting or consequential lives."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So if you're Elon Musk, it's more likely that you're an inspiration."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "Like if you're Donald Trump, or if you're Bill Gates, or you're like, some particularly like distinctive character, you might think that that, I mean, if you just think of yourself into the shoes, right, it's got to

would ask an AGI saying, the question being, what's outside the simulation?"}, {"time": 5134, "text": "Do you think about the answer to this question?"}, {"time": 5137, "text": "If we are living in a simulation, what is outside the simulation?"}, {"time": 5141, "text": "So the programmer of the simulation?"}, {"time": 5144, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think it connects to the question of what's inside the simulation in that."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "So if you had views about the creators of the simulation, it might help you make predictions about what kind of simulation it is, what might happen, what happens after the simulation, if there is some after, but also like the kind of setup."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "So these two questions would be quite closely intertwined."}, {"time":

enough to understand the mechanism that created them?"}, {"time": 5200, "text": "They might understand some aspects of it."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "I mean, it's a level of, it's kind of, there are levels of explanation, like degrees to which you can understand."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "So does your dog understand what it is to be human?"}, {"time": 5213, "text": "Well, it's got some idea,

need."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "But the answer actually, like varies completely depending on what like number eight, nine and 10 insight is."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "It's like whether you want to suppose that the big task were to guess whether a certain number was odd or even, like a 10 digit number."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "And if it's even, the best thing for you to do in life is to go

stuck with the definitional question."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "I mean, the common sense to understand, like the ability to solve complex problems, to learn from experience, to plan, to reason, some

I think it could be fairly intelligent at least without being conscious probably."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "So then what is super intelligence?"}, {"time": 5433, "text": "That would be like something that was much more, had much more general cognitive capacity than we humans have."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "So if we talk about general super intelligence, it would be much faster learner be able to reason much better, make plans that are more effective at achieving its goals, say in a wide range of complex challenging environments."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "In terms of as we turn our eye to the idea of sort of existential threats from super intelligence, do you think super intelligence has to exist in the physical world or can it be digital only?"}, {"time": 5470, "text": "Sort of we think of our general intelligence as us humans, as an intelligence that's associated with the body, that's able to interact with the world, that's able to affect the world directly with physically."},

physical."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "But it's capability to affect the world sort of."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "Could be very strong, even if it has a limited set of actuators, if it can type text on the screen or something like that, that would be, I think, ample."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "So in terms of the concerns of existential threat of AI, how can an AI system that's in the digital world have existential risk, sort of, and what are the attack vectors for a digital system?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Well, I mean, I guess maybe to take one step back, so I should emphasize that I also think there's this huge positive potential from machine intelligence, including super intelligence."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And I want to stress that because some of my writing has focused on what can go wrong."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "And when I wrote the book Superintelligence, at that point, I felt that there was a kind of neglect of what would happen if AI succeeds, and in particular, a need to get a more granular understanding of where the pitfalls are so we can avoid them."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "I think that since the book came out in 2014, there has been a much wider recognition of that."}, {"time": 5566, "text": "And a number of research groups are now actually working on developing, say, AI alignment techniques and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "So yeah, I think now it's important to make sure we bring back onto the table the upside as well."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "And there's a little bit of a neglect now on the upside, which is, I mean, if you look at, I was talking to a friend, if you look at the amount of information that is available, or people talking and people being excited about the positive possibilities of general intelligence, that's not, it's far outnumbered by the negative possibilities in terms of our public discourse."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "Possibly, yeah."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "It's hard to measure."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "But what are, can you linger on that for a little bit, what are some, to you, possible big positive impacts of general intelligence?"}, {"time": 5617, "text": "Super intelligence?"}, {"time": 5618, "text": "Well, I mean, super intelligence, because I tend to also want to distinguish these two different contexts of thinking about AI and AI impacts, the kind of near term and long term, if you want, both of which I think are legitimate things to think about, and people should discuss both of them, but they are different and they often get mixed up."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "And then, then I get, you get confusion, like, I think you get simultaneously like maybe an overhyping of the near term and then under hyping of the long term."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "And so I think as long as we keep them apart, we can have like, two good conversations, but or we can mix them together and have one bad conversation."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "Can you clarify just the two things we were talking about, the near term and the long term?"}, {"time": 5664, "text": "And what are the distinctions?"}, {"time": 5665, "text": "Well, it's a, it's a blurry distinction."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "But say the things I wrote about in this book, super intelligence, long term, things people are worrying about today with, I don't know, algorithmic discrimination, or even things, self driving cars and drones and stuff, more near term."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "And then of course, you could imagine some medium term where they kind of overlap and they one evolves into the other."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "But at any rate, I think both, yeah, the issues look kind of somewhat different depending on which of these contexts."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "So I think, I think it'd be nice if we can talk about the long term and think about a positive impact or a better world because of the existence of the long term super intelligence."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "Do you have views of such a world?"}, {"time": 5720, "text": "I mean, I guess it's a little hard to articulate because it seems obvious that the world has a lot of problems as it currently stands."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "And it's hard to think of any one of those, which it wouldn't be useful to have like a friendly aligned super intelligence working on."}, {"time": 5740, "text": "So from health to the economic system to be able to sort of improve the investment and trade and foreign policy decisions, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "All that kind of stuff and a lot more."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "I mean, what's the killer app?"}, {"time": 5757, "text": "Well, I don't think there is one."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "I think AI, especially artificial general intelligence is really the ultimate general purpose technology."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "So it's not that there is this one problem, this one area where it will have a big impact."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "But if and when it succeeds, it will really apply across the board in all fields where human creativity and intelligence and problem solving is useful, which is pretty much all fields."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "The thing that it would do is give us a lot more control over nature."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "It wouldn't automatically solve the problems that arise from conflict between humans, fundamentally political problems."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "Some subset of those might go away if you just had more resources and cooler tech."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "But some subset would require coordination that is not automatically achieved just by having more technological capability."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "But anything that's not of that sort, I think you just get an enormous boost with this kind of cognitive technology once it goes all the way."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "Now, again, that doesn't mean I'm thinking, oh, people don't recognize what's possible with current technology and like sometimes things get overhyped."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "But I mean, those are perfectly consistent views to hold."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "The ultimate potential being enormous."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "And then it's a very different question of how far are we from that or what can we do with near term technology?"}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So what's your intuition about the idea of intelligence explosion?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So there's this, you know, when you start to think about that leap from the near term to the long term, the natural inclination, like for me, sort of building machine learning systems today, it seems like it's a lot of work to get the general intelligence, but there's some intuition of exponential growth of exponential improvement of intelligence explosion."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "Can you maybe try to elucidate, try to talk about what's your intuition about the possibility of an intelligence explosion, that it won't be this gradual slow process, there might be a phase shift?"}, {"time": 5887, "text": "Yeah, I think it's, we don't know how explosive it will be."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "I think for what it's worth, it seems fairly likely to me that at some point, there will be some intelligence explosion, like some period of time, where progress in AI becomes extremely rapid, roughly, roughly in the area where you might say it's kind of humanish equivalent in core cognitive faculties, that the concept of human equivalent starts to break down when you look too closely at it."}, {"time": 5923, "text": "And just how explosive does something have to be for it to be called an intelligence explosion?"}, {"time": 5929, "text": "Like, does it have to be like overnight, literally, or a few years?"}, {"time": 5934, "text": "But overall, I guess, if you plotted the opinions of different people in the world, I guess that would be somewhat more probability towards the intelligence explosion scenario than probably the average, you know, AI researcher, I guess."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "So and then the other part of the intelligence explosion, or just forget explosion, just progress is once you achieve that gray area of human level intelligence, is it obvious to you that we should be able to proceed beyond it to get to super intelligence?"}, {"time": 5966, "text": "Yeah, that seems, I mean, as much as any of these things can be obvious, given we've never had one, people have different views, smart people have different views, it's like some degree of uncertainty that always remains for any big, futuristic, philosophical grand question that just we realize humans are fallible, especially about these things."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "But it does seem, as far as I'm judging things based on my own impressions, that it seems very unlikely that that would be a ceiling at or near human cognitive capacity."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "And that's such a, I don't know, that's such a special moment, it's both terrifying and exciting to create a system that's beyond our intelligence."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "So maybe you can step back and say, like, how does that possibility make you feel that we can create something, it feels like there's a line beyond which it steps, it'll be able to outsmart you."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And therefore, it feels like a step where we lose control."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "Well, I don't think the latter follows that is you could imagine."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "And in fact, this is what a number of people are working towards making sure that we could ultimately project higher levels of problem solving ability while still making sure that they are aligned, like they are in the service of human values."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "I mean, so losing control, I think, is not a given that that would happen."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "Now you asked how it makes me feel, I mean, to some extent, I've lived with this for so long, since as long as I can remember, being an adult or even a teenager, it seemed to me obvious that at some point, AI will succeed."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And so I actually misspoke, I didn't mean control, I meant, because the control problem is an interesting thing."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "And I think the hope is, at least we should be able to maintain control over systems that are smarter than us."}, {"time": 6095, "text": "But we do lose our specialness, it sort of will lose our place as the smartest, coolest thing on earth."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "And there's an ego involved with that, that humans aren't very good at dealing with."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "I mean, I value my intelligence as a human being."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "It seems like a big transformative step to realize there's something out there that's more intelligent."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "I mean, you don't see that as such a fundamentally..."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "I think yes, a lot, I think it would be small, because I mean, I think there are already a lot of things out there that are, I mean, certainly, if you think the universe is big, there's going to be other civilizations that already have super intelligences, or that just naturally have brains the size of beach balls and are like, completely leaving us in the dust."}, {"time": 6150, "text": "And we haven't come face to face with them."}, {"time": 6153, "text": "We haven't come face to face."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "But I mean, that's an open question, what would happen in a kind of post human world?"}, {"time": 6161, "text": "Like how much day to day would these super intelligences be involved in the lives of ordinary?"}, {"time": 6170, "text": "I mean, you could imagine some scenario where it would be more like a background thing that would help protect against some things, but you wouldn't like that, they wouldn't be this intrusive kind of, like making you feel bad by like, making clever jokes on your expert, like there's like all sorts of things that maybe in the human context would feel awkward about that."}, {"time": 6190, "text": "You don't want to be the dumbest kid in your class, everybody picks it, like, a lot of those things, maybe you need to abstract away from, if you're thinking about this context where we have infrastructure that is in some sense, beyond any or all humans."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "I mean, it's a little bit like, say, the scientific community as a whole, if you think of that as a mind, it's a little bit of a metaphor."}, {"time": 6213, "text": "But I mean, obviously, it's got to be like, way more capacious than any individual."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "So in some sense, there is this mind like thing already out there that's just vastly more intelligent than any individual is."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "And we think, okay, that's, you just accept that as a fact."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "That's the basic fabric of our existence is there's super intelligent."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "You get used to a lot of, I mean, there's already Google and Twitter and Facebook, these recommender systems that are the basic fabric of our, I could see them becoming, I mean, do you think of the collective intelligence of these systems as already perhaps reaching super intelligence level?"}, {"time": 6259, "text": "Well, I mean, so here it comes to the concept of intelligence and the scale and what human level means."}, {"time": 6269, "text": "The kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of those concepts starts to dominate how you would answer that question."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "So like, say the Google search engine has a very high capacity of a certain kind, like retrieving, remembering and retrieving information, particularly like text or images that are, you have a kind of string, a word string key, obviously superhuman at that, but a vast set of other things it can't even do at all."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Not just not do well, but so you have these current AI systems that are superhuman in some limited domain and then like radically subhuman in all other domains."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "Same with a chess, like are just a simple computer that can multiply really large numbers, right?"}, {"time": 6324, "text": "So it's going to have this like one spike of super intelligence and then a kind of a zero level of capability across all other cognitive fields."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "Yeah, I don't necessarily think the generalness, I mean, I'm not so attached with it, but I think it's sort of, it's a gray area and it's a feeling, but to me sort of alpha zero is somehow much more intelligent, much, much more intelligent than Deep Blue."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "And to say which domain, you could say, well, these are both just board games, they're both just able to play board games, who cares if they're going to do better or not, but there's something about the learning, the self play that makes it, crosses over into that land of intelligence that doesn't necessarily need to be general."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "In the same way, Google is much closer to Deep Blue currently in terms of its search engine than it is to sort of the alpha zero."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "And the moment it becomes, the moment these recommender systems really become more like alpha zero, but being able to learn a lot without the constraints of being heavily constrained by human interaction, that seems like a special moment in time."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "I mean, certainly learning ability seems to be an important facet of general intelligence, that you can take some new domain that you haven't seen before and you weren't specifically pre programmed for, and then figure out what's going on there and eventually become really good at it."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "So that's something alpha zero has much more of than Deep Blue had."}, {"time": 6420, "text": "And in fact, I mean, systems like alpha zero can learn not just Go, but other, in fact, probably beat Deep Blue in chess and so forth."}, {"time": 6429, "text": "So you do see this as general and it matches the intuition."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "We feel it's more intelligent and it also has more of this general purpose learning ability."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "And if we get systems that

does it mean for a blood vessel to grow and shrink?"}, {"time": 843, "text": "So a blood vessel is could be an artery or vein or a capillary."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And it, you know, provides oxygen, it provides nutrients gets rid of waste."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So, you know, to different parts of your body if you so so the blood vessels end up being very, very important."}, {"time":

do."}, {"time": 882, "text": "We tried what we wanted to see if we could find substances that could stop that from happening."}, {"time": 885, "text": "So first, I mean, there are many steps."},

polymer systems because the blood vessels grew slowly took months."}, {"time": 897, "text": "That so after we had the polymer system and we had the bio assay, then I isolated many different molecules

work."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And that paper that was this paper I mentioned science in 1976."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Those were really the isolation of some of the very first angiogenesis and blood vessel inhibitors."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So there's a lot of words there."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Yeah, let's go."}, {"time": 929, "text": "First of all, polymer molecules, big, big molecules."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So the what are polymers?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "What's bio assay?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "What is the process of trying to isolate this whole thing simplified to where you can control and experiment with it?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "Polymers are like plastics or like plastics or rubber."}, {"time": 948, "text": "What were some of the other questions?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "Sorry, so a polymer, some plastics and rubber, and that means something that has structure and that could be useful for what?"}, {"time": 963, "text": "Well, in this case, it would be something that could be useful for delivering a molecule for a long time."}, {"time": 965, "text": "So it could slowly diffuse out of that at a controlled rate to where you wanted it to go."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So then you would find the idea is that there would be a particular blood vessels that you can target, say they're connected somehow to a tumor that you could target and over a long period of time to be able to place the polymer there and it'd be delivering a certain kind of chemical."}, {"time": 994, "text": "I think what you said is good."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So so that it would deliver the molecule or the chemical that would stop the blood vessels from going over a long enough time so that it really could happen."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "So that was sort of the what we call the bio assay is the way that we would study that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So, sorry, so what is a bio assay?"}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Which part is the bio assay?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "All of it."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "In other words, the bio assay is the way you study blood vessel growth."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "The blood vessel growth and you can control that somehow with is there an understanding what kind of chemicals could control the growth of a blood vessel?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Well, now there is, but then when I started, there wasn't and that that gets to your original question."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So you go through various steps."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "We did the first steps."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "We showed that a such molecules existed and then we developed techniques for studying them."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "And we even isolated fractions, you know, groups of substances that would do it."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "But what would happen over the next, we did that in 1976, we published that what would happen over the next 28 years is other people would follow in our footsteps."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I mean, we tried to do some stuff too, but ultimately to make a new drug takes billions of dollars."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So what happened was there were different growth factors that people would isolate, sometimes using the techniques that we developed."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "And then they would figure out using some of those techniques, ways to stop those growth factors and ways to stop the blood vessels from growing."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "That like I say, it took 28 years, it took billions of dollars and work by many companies like Genetec."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "But in 2004, 28 years after we started, the first one of those Avastin got approved by the FDA."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And that's become, you know, one of the

protected."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And then what'll happen is glucose will go in and the cells will make insulin."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And so that's an example."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So from an AI robotics perspective, how close are these drug delivery systems to something like a robot?"}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Or is it totally wrong to think about them as intelligent agents?"},

particular delivery system."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Of course, one of the things people are concerned about is cost, and if you add a lot of bells and whistles to something, it'll cost more."},

some instruction to say when there's more glucose, deliver more insulin."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So do you think it's possible that there, that could be robotic type systems roaming our body sort of long term and be able to deliver certain kinds of drugs in the future?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "You see, do you see that kind of future?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "Someday, I don't think we're very close to it yet, but someday, you know that that's nanotechnology and that would mean even miniaturizing some of the things that I just discussed."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And we're certainly not at that point yet, but someday I expect we will be."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So some of it is just the shrinking of the technology."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "That's a part of it, that's one of the things."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "In general, what role do you see AI sort of, there's a lot of work now with using data to make intelligent, create systems that make intelligent decisions."},

tissue engineering or regenerative medicine?"}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Yeah, so that tissue engineering or regenerative medicine have to do with building an organ or tissue from scratch."}, {"time":

canvas that's a structure that you can, on which the cells can grow?"}, {"time": 1783, "text": "I think that's a good explanation what you just did."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "I'll have to use that, the canvas, that's good."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "Yeah, so I think that that's fair."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "You know, and the chip could be such a canvas."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "Could be

what you suggested, you certainly would be possible."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So what kind of tissues can we engineer today?"}, {"time": 1853, "text": "What would, yeah."}, {"time": 1854, "text":

that tissue and do various kinds of experiments in terms of drugs and so on."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "But what does that, does that mean that some kind of healing and treatment of different conditions for unhuman beings?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "Yes, I mean, they've been approved now for, I mean, different groups have made them, different companies and different professors, but they've been approved for burn victims and for patients with diabetic skin ulcers."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "Okay, so skin, what else?"}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Well, at different stages, people are, like skin, blood vessels, there's clinical trials going now for helping patients hear better, for patients that might be paralyzed, for patients that have different eye problems."}, {"time": 1935, "text":

multiple ways that people are trying to deal with that."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "One way is, which was what we've done with Dan Anderson, who was one of my former postdocs and I mentioned this a little bit before for a pancreas, is encapsulating the cells."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "So immune cells or antibodies can't get in and attack them."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So that's a way to protect them."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "Other strategies could be making the cells non immunogenic, which might be done by different either techniques which might mask them or using some gene editing approaches."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "So there are different ways that people are trying to do that."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "And of course, if you use the patient's own cells or cells from a close

that something new is safe and effective in people is almost always the biggest expense."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "Could you linger on that for just a little longer and describe what it takes to prove, for people that don't know, in general, what it takes to prove that something is effective on humans?"}, {"time": 2412, "text": "Well, you'd have to take a particular disease, but the process is you start out with, usually you start out with cells, then you'd go to animal models."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "Usually you have to do a couple animal models."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "And of course the animal models aren't perfect for humans."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "And then you have to do three sets of clinical trials at a minimum, a phase one trial to show that it's safe in small number of patients, a phase two trial to show that it's effective in a small number of patients, and a phase three trial to show that it's safe and effective in a large number of patients."}, {"time":

have to manufacture the drug, you'd have to really watch those patients."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "You have to be very concerned that it is gonna be safe."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "And then you look and see, does it treat the disease better than whatever the gold standard was before that?"}, {"time": 2470, "text": "Assuming there was one."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "That's a really interesting line."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Show that it's safe first, and then that it's effective."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "First do no harm."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "First do no harm, that's right."},

not necessarily has to be the case."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "But for us, usually it is."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Usually we do a certain amount of research and make some findings."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And we had a hypothesis, let's say we prove it, or we make some discovery, we invent some technique."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "And then we write something up, what's called a disclosure."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "We give it to MIT's technology transfer office."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "They then give it to some patent attorneys, and they use that plus talking to us and work on writing a patent."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "And then you go back and forth with the USPTO, that's the United States Patent and Trademark Office."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And they may not

"Well, I'd break that down into a couple of categories."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And I'm a scientist and certainly from the science standpoint, I'll go over that."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "But I actually think that really the most important thing is probably the business people that I work with."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And when I look back at the companies that have done well, it's been because we've had great business people."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "And when they haven't done as well, we haven't had as good business people."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "But from a science standpoint, I think about that we've made some kind of discovery that is almost what I'd call a platform that you could use it for different things."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "And certainly the drug delivery system example that I gave earlier is a good example of that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "You could use it for drug A, B, C, D, E and so forth."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And that I'd like to think that we've taken it far enough so that we've written at least one really good paper in a top journal, hopefully a number that we've reduced it to practice and animal models that we've filed patents, maybe had issued patents that have what I'll call very good and broad claims."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "That's sort of the key on a patent."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And then in our case, a lot of times when we've done it, a lot of times it's somebody in the lab like a postdoc or graduate student that spent a big part of their life doing it and that they wanna work at that company

things."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "You have to be good with people, good manager of people."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "So the money and the people part I get, but the stuff before in terms of deciding

mean, the kinds of things that I would think about is, is the market big or small?"}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Is the, are there good animal models for it so that you could test it and it wouldn't take 50 years?"}, {"time": 2745, "text": "Are the clinical trials that could be set up ones that have clear end points where you can make a judgment?"}, {"time": 2753, "text": "And another issue would be

wrestling."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You're setting against the wall."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Because you're tired."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So then all of a sudden they say, okay, go ahead and drink water during practice, drink greater aid during practice."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And all of a sudden at the end of practice, we're still out there competing."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And so I look at my career for two and a half years where I, and junior high too."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So I got another three years where I didn't really, wasn't able to push as good as I could because I just was probably under."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Under hydrated."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So, but at the individual level, in terms of the impossible, when did you first believe the thing that maybe probably people would laugh at you about was that you would be an Olympic champion?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Well, I always visualized me being the best."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "You believed it in the very beginning."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Forever, forever."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "Yeah, I was, because I was, I don't know if you'd call it a dreamer or somebody that, I was just involved with competitive sports at the YMCA from age five."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Did you tell people that dream that you're gonna be Olympic champion one day?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "You're gonna be the best in the world?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I think they knew."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And the only reason why they knew, cause there was something a little different about this guy."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "He's not gonna stop."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Well, he was out in the yard."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And he was swinging baseball bats."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "He was swinging baseball at six, at seven, and eight, and nine, and 10."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And he was swinging baseball bats, so much right handed and so much left hand with nobody even there throwing the ball."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "That all of a sudden when they walked by, all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt on both sides."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So it's like, they saw me out in the yard playing by myself sports, or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "But if they weren't there, if you walked in my front room, I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And I was running and running through the furniture, that type stuff."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And the coaches at the YMCA level, the junior high level, they saw this guy come first and end up last."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But I wasn't that great."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "I wasn't the fastest guy at that time."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And I wasn't the strongest guy."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Actually, before I went to the Olympics, when they tested me, they tested everybody."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And I probably came back with one of the highest scores, but it was not like the highest person on this and this and that."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I was all high across the board, straight across the board high on every one of them."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "But there was always people that were higher than me."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "But then they would go down."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Then they would test on something else and go back up."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Mine stayed high all across the board."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And so I really didn't have too many flaws, but I didn't have any things that also said that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic games."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "So take me through that day, if you could."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram freestyle wrestling gold, you scored 57 points, if I'm correct, and had zero points scored on you."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "57, zero."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So maybe take me through almost the details."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What was your routine?"}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What was your process?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "What was going through your mind, your thoughts of that day?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day because we weighed in every day at that time."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "In the morning?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Yeah, we weighed in two hours before the start of the competition."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "And so that didn't mean that you weighed in two hours before you wrestled, because you didn't know whether you're gonna wrestle right away or later on."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "In fact, in that day, I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So had all day to recover, but I didn't really need it anyway, because I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight, but it was just interesting."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "But what was in your mind?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "What were you thinking?"}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Were you?"}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I was confident."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "You knew you were gonna win the gold."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Yeah, I knew I was gonna win."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "But in reality, I didn't know it from a cocky point of view."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "I only knew it because for the last one, two, three and a half years, I had been going to practice, and I'd win in every practice."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "You felt good, you won."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And I hardly ever lose a takedown."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And if I lost, if somebody scored on me, it was like when I went to bed, I couldn't sleep until I figured it out."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Or if I didn't figure it out, I would fall asleep and I would wake up with the answer of what I needed, why I got scored upon."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So maybe now that you've won the gold, can you tell me in the practice room when somebody took you down, how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?"}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Timing, technique?"}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Very difficult, but somebody could, because they were going for one move."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "All I wanted was one move."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Whereas if you can arrest somebody, arrest them the whole practice or half a practice for at least 10, 15 minutes, and they were maybe gonna score if they could work it in their mind."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "But they knew that was gonna be their victory."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me, at that, when you're going for the Olympic gold, you didn't want to allow any takedowns."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position, a weak point or something."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "It's important to not let down, take down."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "It's kind of like what we were saying before."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "If something happened and somebody scored on me in a certain way, I would go over that situation, over that situation, over it again, and I would come up with an answer."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And then I would actually test it."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day because I didn't want the guy to not have some, I didn't want him to think that I was thinking about it all night, I didn't tell him."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But maybe three days later when he wrestled again, I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move, and I got stopped and didn't score, I had to go back and filter that."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I could usually solve it."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Let's go back to the Olympic games."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So I get up in the Olympic in the morning and I'm not sure when the weigh ins were, but I think I was probably a pound over."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And that's about a half a kilo and 1.1 pounds is a kilo because we went in kilograms."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So what do you do with that pound?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "You aren't off or?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "No, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there and I got in the sauna."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And the funny thing was the morning of the finals, there was another athlete in the sauna."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "And it was American or?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "No, it was a European."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I don't remember where she was from."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Not a Russian."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And she didn't have her top on."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And that was pretty common."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And so, you know, it was kind of interesting."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "You think back about it because there's some funny things that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games, in world games, anytime when you have country against country."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Did any of it affect you?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Was there any?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "You lost a little bit over a pound."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "I lost a little more than a pound."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "But it didn't really bother me because I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "So your match against the Russian, the... Azhelyov."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Yeah, Azhelyov."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "He went on to be a two time world champion, a silver medalist as well."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "I mean, this is an incredible wrestler."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So what was going through your mind before stepping on the mat with that guy?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers, haven't had a point scored on you."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And you're stepping on the mat against this Russian who you said was really, they picked, the Soviets picked to beat you."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Right, and I know why they picked him because he had a great attitude."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So he wasn't just the typical artist."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "He was a good artist."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "He hooked elbows like Azhelyov."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And he's from that area of the world where they have some of those types of moves."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "But he, and he was a goer, but by cutting him down a weight, he lost some of that go."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "And I don't know if, you gotta, that's a process you gotta go about scientifically."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And so, if you don't do it as an American, it can really hurt your performance."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "If you don't do it as a Russian, it can hurt your performance."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And they already didn't really do that a lot where you usually wrestle the weight where it was more like your weight."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And so by cutting him down, maybe slowed his belief down a little bit."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So you saw it in him."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "Yeah, but then he came back and he won rest of the matches and he was in the round robin and he was able to go to the finals, but he had lost another match actually against in the round robin against the Japanese."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So I think I had already gained enough of artistic, being able to finish a match."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Once I lost my match in college for the last two years, I took on some of that artistic work."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And I think that he was already hoping to win, but he was hoping to win by a long ways because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points to be able to win the gold."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And that wasn't gonna happen."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "I can't remember too many that I took that would actually put me in a danger position."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "I've taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically, technically correct that I wouldn't land in that danger zone."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "It's like, if I'm gonna lock up and throw you, I'm not gonna throw you to my own back and roll you through."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "I'm gonna turn in the air."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So you were scientific about it."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I learned the hard way."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling that you did that exposed your shoulders, which it cost me in some early freestyle matches against great wrestlers."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves to where I hit a Granby roll where you expose your shoulders and you lose two points every time."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "But you learn that that's not the system."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "But if you hadn't wrestled much, you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "You would hit it."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So you won the gold."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "I think it would have, I think the question would be how would it feel if you lost the gold for me?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Because I already went through that once."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Not at that highest level, but the National Collegiate Championship level my senior year."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "The Larry Owings loss."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Larry Owings, yeah."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And that didn't sit well."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Were you afraid of that happening again at the Olympic level?"}, {"time": 1725, "text": "Was that even a thought?"}, {"time": 1726, "text": "No, I really wasn't."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "But it was why I changed my philosophy of training and added to the scientific artist type."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And if I had won that match, even though I wouldn't have felt good about it, even though I squeaked it out, I wasn't feeling good about that match."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "It would have affected me a little bit, but if I'd have won it, I would have got over it."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "I mean, I'm not over it now."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff right before my match."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "By that, I mean this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Interviews, yeah, journalists."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker then."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now, except for I got a little cold, but I don't think I could say two words hardly then."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And they took takes."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Wide World of Sports said, hey, we want you to be the introduction for our next week's show."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "So I just say, hey, I'm Dan Gable."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and 0."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "That's what they want me to say."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "And I said it."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "I had to take it 22 times."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And the last two or three times they wrote it out and I read it and it still wasn't like I just said it."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "You know, that type of stuff."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So, and he finally just closed the book and said, yeah, that's good enough."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "But I turned and it was my time to wrestle."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And so, you know, you just, you learn that, and for me it was great coaching experience because that's what I turned into be."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And I put out a lot of champions, but you learn through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made, you know, it's an ever learning process."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "It's an ever learning process."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Have you ever been afraid on the mat?"}, {"time": 1840, "text": "Does fear have any role do you think for a wrestler or it must be out there?"}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Well, I'm sure fear is out there."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "He had these doubts."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "He probably had these doubts."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And that gives me the edge."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "And I don't know if I really ever had fear, but obviously there was points in times where I didn't perform as well, not many, but a few."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And if I look back of it, look back at it, I don't think it was that American, you know, raw, raw, raw stuff."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "I think it was probably the fear of not being an artist as much."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "You know, maybe this guy might be better than me scientifically."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "And you know, you're a scientist."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "I think that got to me more than anything else."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "I said early on that I want to eliminate ever having to worry about getting tired in a match."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So I kind of eliminated that."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "So I got rid of that point."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "And I do think that in wrestling, that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have, actually how they feel during the match and are they gonna get tired and is it gonna affect my performance?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And as a coach, that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my athletes."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So there wasn't that fear factor, but that fear factor would be put upon my opponent, which would give me an edge."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "But that's not what I needed as much."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I needed to just focus, make sure that I was doing the right things."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "And I needed my team to be focused."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete or even as a coach sometimes, that I didn't repeat them."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Didn't repeat them."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it, then it's like you didn't learn anything."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Your goal throughout your wrestling career, as you've beautifully put, was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?"}, {"time": 1972, "text": "That you would be carried off the mat."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So you never did successfully in, that's one of the ways you failed in your career is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Have you ever come close?"}, {"time": 1982, "text": "Do you remember a time that you've come close that you've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "You know, the question is really a good question about that pushing to you collapse."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Because I don't, as a coach today, I don't think I get, if I said that to my athletes, I don't know, I could get in trouble."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Because, you know, it's like."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "But it's understood, isn't it, by the athletes?"}, {"time": 2006, "text": "Yeah, they understand it."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "But the outside might not understand it."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "Because it's almost like, what do you mean there?"}, {"time": 2014, "text": "You push them to the point where they go collapse."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "It means they may die or something might happen to them."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "And, you know, that's dangerous."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "But it's something that's highly unlikely that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "But I'm gonna tell you, there's many times in a practice where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden the whistle blew or it was time to stop."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at and I needed water, I needed fresh air, because you're usually in a fairly small room with a lot of guys that the heat rises and it's hard to breathe."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times not by the door, the far end of the room."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "I can remember walking from the far end of the room to that door."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "And I can remember, am I gonna make it the next step?"}, {"time": 2067, "text": "Am I gonna make it the next step?"}, {"time": 2068, "text": "I need air, I need water, I need oxygen, I need to get out of here."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "It didn't happen often, but I can recount four or five times in my career that I pushed myself to that level where I thought I was gonna maybe go out, but every step I was dizzy."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "But once I got to that door, I was able to open it and go out and grab the water and get cold water in my face."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And so, no, I never really was able to do that."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "And I think the story is in a book where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "It made you proud."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "Oh my gosh, and she didn't win."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "But she pushed a collapse."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "Now, did she suffer because of that?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Well, she didn't get to go to the next event because she had to qualify."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "But I think it probably helped her too, realizing because she was winning the race and she was beating people she normally never pushed, but she was at a new level that she had never been before and she only needed about five feet to finish."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And it was just one of those things that I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And it probably made her realize that she could be better, but she had to hold up though."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "So you mentioned in Wrestling Life that the Brands Brothers looked up to Roy Salger, who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling, but not getting too rough."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling, but at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?"}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "I think anger would cause you to make mistakes and actually get out of position because I think anger is kind of a loss of control."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And there can be a furious type of attack, but I think if it crosses the line to anger, then you're gonna be vulnerable."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge, through the edge, but when the whistle blew, they stopped."}, {"time": 2212,

this actually, and he tried."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq and was of course criticized by many people for doing that."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "But at the

be that he didn't resist the pressures that were there, but he did not make those pressures."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So is there something about putting the responsibility on the president to form the structure around him locally such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?"}, {"time": 1321, "text": "So what I'm talking to is hiring."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "So basically just everybody you work with, you have power as a president to fire and hire or to basically schedule meetings in such a way that can control your decision making."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So I imagine it's very difficult to get out of Afghanistan or Iraq when most of your scheduled meetings are with generals or something like that."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But if you reorganize the schedule and

often takes us a long time to make those adjustments until we go into such bad circumstances that we have no choice."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So in the battle of power of the office of the president versus the United States military, the department of defense, do you have a sense that the president has more power ultimately?"}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So to decrease the size of the department of defense, to withdraw from any wars, or increase the amount of wars, is the president, you're kind of implying the president has a lot of power here in this scale."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Yes, the president has a lot of power and we are fortunate and it was just proven in the last few years that our military, uniquely among many countries with large militaries, is very deferential to the president and very restricted in its ability to challenge the president."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So that's a strength of our system."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "But the way you reform the military is not with individual decisions."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "It's by having a strategic plan that reexamines what role it plays."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So it's not just about whether we're in

detail, but the panpsychist does it the other way around."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "They start with consciousness and try to get matter out of consciousness."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So the idea is basically at the fundamental level of reality, at the fundamental level of reality, there are just networks of very simple conscious entities."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "But these conscious entities, because they have very simple kinds of experience, they behave in predictable ways."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Through their interactions, they realize certain mathematical structures."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "And then the idea is those mathematical structures just are the structures identified by physics."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "So when we think about these simple conscious entities in

frameworks within which to describe how we get all the reality that we perceive around us."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "To me, to me, there's no reason why that kind of framework cannot also include

they are."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "What I was trying to address was a common misunderstanding of panpsychism, that it's a sort of dualistic theory."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "The idea is that

had lots of intense but friendly discussions with, you know, wants to compare consciousness to life."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "But I think there's this radical difference that in the case of life,

a lot higher resolution of sensory information, don't you think that's correlated to the richness of the experience?"}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So doesn't more information provide a richer experience?"}, {"time": 5523, "text": "Or is that, again, thinking quantitatively and not thinking about the subjective experience?"}, {"time": 5528, "text": "Like you can experience a lot with very little sensory information, perhaps."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Do you think those are connected?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "So there are features, characteristics here we can grade, the complexity of the experience."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "And on the integrated information theory, they correlate that in terms of mathematically identifiable structure with integrated information."}, {"time":

6234, "text": "And they had printed a whole bunch of money that was out there."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "So this begins the problem for England."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "And that begins the end of England as the world's superpower."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "And the way they tried to fight that was to get more and more countries around the world to establish central banks and have, and hold

coin, you know, that raises the value of your shit coin."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "Can you define shit coin?"}, {"time": 6263, "text": "Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin is that it's any form of money where somebody can produce it."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "So soft money."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "Not necessarily, I guess."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "I think the difference, so there's easy money, but the shit coin is something that someone can produce at a rate that is, at a cost that is different from the market cost."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "So gold, nobody can make gold except if they dig for it."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "And the cost of mining gold is generally in the range of the price of gold."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "Seems true for Bitcoin."}, {"time":

could click a button and make 10 times the supply."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "Would it be fair to say that this began with the will for war in World War I?"}, {"time": 6323, "text": "So the march towards fiat began with a global desire for war in the 20th century."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "Did war start this or was war a result?"}, {"time": 6339, "text": "It's difficult to say really."},

acknowledge or think about the pros of fiat currency."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "Can you do just that, look at the benefit and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?"}, {"time": 6403,

"text": "And I think it does have value in the fact that the reason that they were able to pull it off is because it was not possible for people who don't want to be part of it to use gold independently of governments."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "This is really the key thing."}, {"time": 6449, "text": "Gold is just very expensive to move around."}, {"time": 6451, "text": "And the fact that it is expensive to move around means that there's inevitably going to emerge institutions where it is centralized in physical location."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "So really the gold standard intrinsically must involve credit as becoming part of the monetary system."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "It has to be the credit and because it gets centralized it can easily be captured by the government."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "So to be fair, the benefits of the fiat system is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around, which is pretty significant."}, {"time": 6491, "text": "Like generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1% of the cost of the gold bar."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "So you move it 100 times back and forth between the Atlantic, you need to pay the whole gold bar, the cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times across."},

halfway around the world."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "Is there also something to be said about the cost in time?"}, {"time": 6521, "text": "So you're saving the sort of, you're reducing the friction of the communication as well."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "Of the transactions as well."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "Exactly, it's faster."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "How big is that benefit?"}, {"time": 6532, "text": "Because wouldn't you argue that that potential is the thing that enables modern economy, both the speed and the low cost, so increasing the scale and the frequency, the speed of the transactions?"}, {"time": 6543, "text": "Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "However, it isn't as if you couldn't have fast transactions built on top of gold."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "So you could have gold being used for final settlement and you could have banks settling with one another essentially using credit settlement."}, {"time": 6561, "text": "Can you define settlement just for people who are outside of this world?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "Because we'll mention that word quite a bit probably."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "So the way that it works is, let's say right now I'm gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card within a few seconds that I've sent you the money and then that's yours."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds that my bank, which could be in another country, sent the money to your bank into your account."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "There's a lot of infrastructure underneath that."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "So what actually happened is that I have an account with my bank and you have an account with your bank."}, {"time": 6601, "text": "And when the message is communicated from my app to yours, my bank crosses out the money and your bank credits you with the money."}, {"time": 6610, "text": "And then at the end of the day, week or month, banks in the same city will settle with one another, banks in the same country will settle with one another and banks from different countries will settle with one another."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "At the end of the day or week or month, they'll tally all of the money that was sent from one bank to the other and then just settle the difference."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "So it turns out at the end of the month, my bank had sent $15 million to your bank and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "So they give them $1 million and that settles it, that finalizes the transaction."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "So final settlement 3D is like the, you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "And then you can think of these things as being the higher layer levels."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "And you had a wonderful discussion about that with Michael Saylor."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "So the final settlement is like the moment when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "Or to some representation of physical reality."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Yeah, and under gold, everything was tethered to physical reality because there was a market commodity at the bottom of all of this and nobody could print that market commodity."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "And so at the end of the month, if your bank made too many payments, if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "If you were reckless, if you were insolvent, you went out of business."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "So there was no way to fool that."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "But then we moved to the fiat century and everything is credit."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "At the end of the day, the final layer is government credit."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And so as long as you're friends with the government, basically you never go bankrupt."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "So in part two of the fiat standard called Fiat Life, you describe the effects of fiat money on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money on our world, on our life?"}, {"time": 6735, "text": "So taking a step outside of the monetary system, actually like how that affects our life from this book?"}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I mean, there's a whole bunch of things and I won't be able to go over them and I highly recommend reading the book."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "But if I were to pick one, I would say it's the impact that it has on our time preference, on our valuation of the future."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "So remember when we started the discussion, I said that the key function of money is that it serves as a store of value."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And the harder the money is, the better it is at providing us with a way for providing for our future."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "And so the harder the money is, the less we discount the future."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "We always discount the future compared to the present."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So if I told you, I'm gonna give you something today versus giving it to you 10 years from now, the same thing, you would prefer to take it now because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "So we always prefer the present to the future."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "There's always a discount on the future."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "And that discount is called time preference."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "The degree to which we prefer the present to the future is called our time preference."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "So the higher our time preference, the less we care about the future."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "And the process of civilization is the process of lowering our time preference, where we start caring more for the future, we start prioritizing the present less and less."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "So we start being able to not consume everything that we have and store it."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And so money is essential for that."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "And under the gold standard, everyone in the world had the ability to provide for their future by simply using the same money that they use."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin and you could take that gold coin and keep it safe for 10 years and know that at the end of those 10 years, that gold coin would buy you slightly more than what it bought you the day that you earned it."}, {"time": 6839, "text": "So anybody could provide for their future and anybody could have very high degree of certainty that whatever they're saving is going to be there when they want it in the future."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "Because the money supply was only increasing at one and a half percent, whereas the production of goods and services was increasing for most cases, for most periods at a higher rate than that."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "So you could buy more apples and oranges and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years than you could at the beginning of the 10 years."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "So everybody had a way of providing for the future."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "And with that, people lower their time preference."}, {"time": 6874, "text": "And that is reflected across all aspects of life."}, {"time": 6878, "text": "I think it's not just the economic thing."}, {"time": 6880, "text": "You see it in the savings rate, the ability to deny yourself gratification today."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "I could take the money that I have and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht or have a better life or give my children a better life."}, {"time": 6901, "text": "So all of human civilization really is the process of us lowering our time preference and finding harder monies that allow us to provide better for the future is how we really technologically we do that."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "I think of the hardness of money as being the control knob for our time preference."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "And you can see this reflected in the 20th century where we go from the money supply increases at around one and a half percent under gold to this current situation where over the last 60 years I ran the numbers on money supply and fiat, the global fiat supply has increased at around 14% per year."}, {"time": 6938, "text": "So we've done a 10X in the increase in the supply of money annually."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And 14% is a weighted average."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "So if you take a basic numerical average for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%."},

Venezuelan Bolivar increasing at 500% a year and the dollar increasing at 8% a year, if you do it by value of the currencies so that you get the total supply of fiat, it's something like 14%."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "And weighted is 30% you said?"}, {"time": 6975, "text": "Yeah, 30%."}, {"time": 6977, "text": "I'd like to see the worst ones, the people that are tracking that average up."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number."}, {"time": 6985, "text": "And so you're saying that, sorry, that's the average over the century or the past 100 years?"},

numbers on that weighted average, something like 14%."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "And what effect that has on time preference?"}, {"time": 7005, "text": "The effect is now it's much, much, much harder for everybody to provide for their future."}, {"time": 7010, "text": "Everywhere in the world, it's much harder."}, {"time": 7012, "text": "So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin that I could just put under my mattress and expect it to be there 10 years from now?"}, {"time": 7019, "text": "Well, gold itself isn't cutting it."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "Gold can't keep up with inflation."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "And the reason for that is that gold is not being used as a money anymore in that you can't send it internationally."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "Internationally, you can't use it to settle trade internationally, which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal."}, {"time": 7043, "text": "And as a result of the fact that its value doesn't keep up with inflation, it becomes economical to use it in industry."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "So we're seeing gold become like silver in that it gets used in industry."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "So the stockpile declines."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well, and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "And it can't protect your wealth over time very well."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "Well, you could invest."}, {"time": 7067, "text": "And this is kind of the obvious answer that Keynesian will give you is, well, you just put your money in an investment."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "But investment is different from saving."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "Saving, the whole point of saving is that the thing is liquid and that the thing carries little uncertainty."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "You just held the gold coin and it just sat there."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "It did nothing."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "It didn't take risk."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody to go and do something with it."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "And it could work, it could not work."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "If it works, you get a positive return."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "You get more gold back."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back."}, {"time": 7101, "text": "So taking on risk is something very different from saving."}, {"time": 7104, "text": "Saving is just a way of buying the future."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "Investing is taking on a risk and you could lose everything with it."}, {"time": 7111, "text": "So what ends up happening, and this is the Keynesian objection I think is very wrong and bad because investment is a job in itself."}, {"time": 7124, "text": "To figure out what to do with your money in order to beat inflation is something that there are professionals out there on Wall Street that have PhDs in finance, that have enormous computers, and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees and math nerds that are crunching numbers and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio so that you can beat inflation."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "The majority of them don't beat inflation."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "The majority of them can't beat inflation."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent, but if you remember."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "14%."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%, like if you look at just the increase in the money supply, which I think is a much better metric."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "And this is what's reflected on the desirable goods."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "Like if you look at the price of real estate in Miami Beach, as Michael Saylor

supply."}, {"time": 7184, "text": "And you can beat CPI, but CPI is designed so you can beat it, but you can't really beat the appreciation in the things that you actually want to buy, in the price of good food, the price of good real estate."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a

yours or somebody else's, you borrow it or you give them equity, but there's real resources."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "Now, what happened with the fiat system?"}, {"time": 7663, "text": "And this is, you know, the first part of the book where I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective is essentially, and I think this is like the breakthrough inside of the book, what fiat does is that it replaces gold mining with credit creation."}, {"time": 7679, "text": "The way that we make fiat money, the way that fiat is mined into existence is through credit creation."}, {"time": 7685, "text": "Most people think of fiat money as being something that happens when government prints money."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "And we still use the term government's printing money, but the vast majority of fiat is not physical."}, {"time": 7694, "text": "And in fact, fiat is not created when it is printed physically, it's created when it is lent."}, {"time": 7699, "text": "So when you go to a bank to get a $1 million loan to buy a house, that bank is not gonna give you a million dollars from their own money or from their depositor's money."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "When you walk out of that bank, the money supply has increased by $1 million to finance your home."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "So what fiat does is, I mean, it was basically born out of government credit and the credit of banks that are backed by the central bank and the government."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "So if you're part of the institutions that are allowed fiat privilege, where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank, backed by the currency, you are effectively creating new currency, new money every time you issue the loan."},

long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that."}, {"time": 7786, "text": "But in the case of the fiat system, it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement."}, {"time": 7791, "text": "Everybody who uses the currency is forced to be part of that agreement."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "Because if you default, effectively what's protecting the bank from you is the fact that the government can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "So effectively."}, {"time": 7807, "text": "So that little agreement between the bank and you is actually an agreement between the bank, you, and the entire populace that's using the currency."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "They're forced to provide the safety net for you and me to go and make that loan."}, {"time": 7821, "text": "And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency."}, {"time": 7824, "text": "That's how the whole thing actually works."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "So this is why I wrote the Bitcoin standard, explaining Bitcoin, and basically the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can, because this is the best money that has ever been invented."}, {"time": 7838, "text": "And we'll talk about that, why Bitcoin is the hardest money."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard, and again, this is not financial advice, I'm a lowly academic, you shouldn't listen to me on issues of money, but I think theoretically and intellectually, the conclusion of the fiat system is you need to be short fiat as much as you can."}, {"time": 7858, "text": "That's the smart winning move."}, {"time": 7860, "text": "So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save, try and not borrow as much as you can, try and accumulate as much savings as you can."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "That's reversed under fiat."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "If you're saving money, you're just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans."}, {"time": 7874, "text": "If you're taking on loans, you're benefiting from all the people that are borrowing."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "So the winning move under the fiat system, and this is what rich people do, is you borrow."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "Rich people under the fiat monetary system, they don't hold assets."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "If you're worth a billion dollars today, you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "You've got maybe a hundred thousand, a million, five million or something like that."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "The majority is going to be held in all kinds of other hard assets."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "And you're gonna be borrowing."},

borrowers in the world."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful, because every time you're borrowing, you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money."}, {"time": 7923, "text": "So you're devaluing everybody else's money and you're getting a bit of the cut."}, {"time": 7926, "text": "If you were going to buy a house with your savings, you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value."}, {"time": 7933, "text": "And if I were to go buy the same house with credit, I'm getting the bank to print money for me."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "So obviously they can cut me in on that deal."}, {"time": 7943, "text": "And that's why it's much cheaper for everybody to buy with credit."}, {"time": 7946, "text": "That's why everybody buys everything on credit."}, {"time": 7949, "text": "So when we look at the global monetary system, the thing you wanna do as a government is be the sexiest currency out there."}, {"time": 7957, "text":

the whole thing."}, {"time": 7995, "text": "Yeah, you could say that, but I think it's more realistic looking at how it has actually evolved over the past few decades."}, {"time": 8001, "text": "It's really a dollar system."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "It's not a system of currencies buying with one another."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "It's a dollar system, and all other currencies are just basically, I like to call them dollar plus country risk."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "So each."}, {"time": 8014, "text": "It always returns home to the dollar."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "Yeah, there is no competition."}, {"time": 8017, "text": "There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "And money is like that."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "Gold was a winner take

system of several currencies, you're just reinventing barter."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "So in the case of the dollar system, the global dollar system is built around the dollar because all central

"text": "What is SWIFT?"}, {"time": 8167, "text": "What are the possible future evolutions of the global monetary system?"}, {"time": 8171, "text": "Yeah, so SWIFT is the network that the US Federal Reserve uses for moving money around the world."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "So basically the US government can sanction you off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks, as they've done with Iran, and as they've done with Afghanistan."}, {"time": 8187, "text": "So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe of the current monetary system is that in order to be able to trade as a member,

{"time": 8251, "text": "It has to be a political system with fiat because ultimately it relies on credit."}, {"time": 8255, "text": "And then the government is the one that has the guns and the government is going to decide who gets to pay their loans anyway."}, {"time": 8260, "text": "And the government's going to have to make its own rules about who gets to play and who doesn't."}, {"time": 8267, "text": "And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system."}, {"time": 8272, "text": "And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard, initially I used to be much more of a gold bug."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years saying the global monetary system is going to collapse next week and we're going to go back to a gold standard."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "And writing the fiat standard gave me a very good appreciation for why this hasn't happened and why it's not very likely to happen."}, {"time": 8295, "text": "I think the reason is, as I said earlier, just gold is very expensive to move around and perhaps more importantly, it's very expensive to verify."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "That's really the problem with it."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "It's very expensive to verify that the gold that you're receiving is original gold."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "So the only way to do this properly is to melt the gold bars down and recast them, which is pretty expensive."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "So we have this situation now where Russia, which is one of the biggest economies in the world has been kicked off to varying degrees off the global monetary system and the US has confiscated their reserves."}, {"time": 8329, "text": "And I don't have political opinions about the war."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "It's not something I'm very familiar with."}, {"time": 8334, "text": "It's outside of my area of expertise."}, {"time": 8336, "text": "I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "It is, on the one hand, whether you think the war is justified or the sanctions are justified is not something I can opine on."}, {"time": 8348, "text": "But the implication of this is that effectively the US might be shooting itself in the foot because it's telling everybody in the world, your money in our system is not really your money."}, {"time": 8358, "text": "It's just a token to play in our arcade."}, {"time": 8362, "text": "And any point in time, if you misbehave, we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens."}, {"time": 8367, "text": "And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran and many countries have made a lot of noise about over the past decades."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "It got real this year, but it's been decades of China, Iran and Russia to some extent saying that, you know, we wanna build an alternative to the US dollar based system."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "And yet they haven't."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "And I think there's very good reasons they haven't."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "And the reason is, what do you do based on?"}, {"time": 8394, "text": "How do you build it?"}, {"time": 8395, "text": "So you can do a credit based system based on, but then who's gonna be the big boss?"}, {"time": 8400, "text": "Is it gonna be China?"}, {"time": 8401, "text": "Is it gonna be Russia?"}, {"time": 8402, "text": "Is it gonna be Iran?"}, {"time": 8403, "text": "Is it gonna be India?"}, {"time": 8404, "text": "None of these countries wants to be, you know, they don't wanna jump out of the US based system to get into somebody else's based system."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system."}, {"time": 8416, "text": "And so therefore you can't use their own central bank's currencies."}, {"time": 8419, "text": "Don't you think they have enough leverage, India, China, Russia combined with several other nations have enough leverage and incentive to create their own system?"}, {"time": 8432, "text": "So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on?"}, {"time": 8437, "text": "Like who's going to be the boss?"}, {"time": 8439, "text": "Who's going to be the one who can?"}, {"time": 8440, "text": "In this case, China, right?"}, {"time": 8444, "text": "Because China's becoming increasingly an economic power in the world."}, {"time": 8448, "text": "That's hard to deny."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "Yes, it's true."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "And it's the most likely scenario perhaps if we were to witness something like this is going to be a Chinese based system."}, {"time": 8457, "text": "So is it possible to have like a split in what is the driving currency of the world?"}, {"time": 8464, "text": "It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable."}, {"time": 8466, "text": "Again, money wants to be won."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "And that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going to hurt economically from what happened from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "So it's not going to be in a position."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "And of course, because it's outside of the US based system, it's not in the strongest negotiating position with the Chinese."}, {"time": 8490, "text": "So the Chinese might be able to get them to join their Yuan based system."}, {"time": 8494, "text": "But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run because these governments can issue their laws and make their designs and then make their monetary systems."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people and billions of dollar based people and they're going to want to trade with one another."}, {"time": 8513, "text": "And the power to want to trade with one another is too strong."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "We can't just split the world economy into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "So then they're going to want to trade with one another."}, {"time": 8522, "text": "Or the dark possibility is the inability to trade as opposed to being a forcing function for trade."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "It will become a forcing function for conflict in cyberspace and potentially hot war."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "Yes, this is the scary part of it."}, {"time": 8542, "text": "And this is basically how World War II happened because there's an old historian who used to say when I think his name is Otto Mallory and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard, if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will."}, {"time": 8555, "text": "If people trade with one another, they have an incentive for each other's wellbeing and then they have less of an incentive to fight."}, {"time": 8562, "text": "And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s because of the failure of the fiat system that brought about the rise of the populism and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other and helped finance the war and bring it about."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "So that is the scary possibility."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "And of course, you can't discount that with all of the escalation that you see, that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "But then even so, I think ultimately, you can't fight wars forever."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "It's going to end at some point."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "And we're going to be back at square one or well, not square one."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "We're going to be back at the same dilemma of who's going to have the global monetary system."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "And so one alternative is that what the Chinese and the Russians could do is they could base it on a commodity."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "So a lot of people are now saying, well, they're going to base it on copper and corn and agricultural commodities."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "And that's the analysis of saleability that we discuss in the Bitcoin standard and the fiat standard."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "I don't think that's workable."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "If you end up basing the monetary system on copper, as we said earlier, it doesn't matter how many governments say that we're going to make a new monetary system based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "You're going to have to stockpile those things in order to make a market in them."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "And then if you stockpile those things, you're just raising their value, inviting the producers to make more, flood the market."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "I hope they don't try this because it's going to be a devastating, devastating impact on the world economy."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "You're going to have central banks bidding up the price of essential commodities that people need for real uses in order to back their currencies with them, and then just incentivizing the producers to make more and more and more of it, and then bringing the price back down."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "So it's going to be a very expensive mistake where we raise the price of copper, destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper, and it's not just copper, but also food, and then increase the supply beyond what we need."}, {"time": 8678, "text": "And the end result is copper miners make out well, governments go broke, and we end up with a lot of rust in copper in government warehouses."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "That's why I don't think it works to use commodities that are not monetary commodities."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "Then the question is maybe gold."}, {"time": 8698, "text": "Can we go back on another gold standard?"}, {"time": 8700,

seem to have said that they're fixing the price of gold in rubles."}, {"time": 8715, "text": "So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate, which effectively means you're on a gold

deal because, you know, as I said earlier, money is always whatever is the hardest to make, and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make."}, {"time": 8983, "text": "And then the second property, which

invented."}, {"time": 9017, "text": "And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously, enormously significant invention because if you read the fiat standard and the Bitcoin standard as well, you'll see my perspective for why I think a very large number of problems in the world are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation, and caused by government having access to essentially an infinite recourse to people's wealth."}, {"time": 9045, "text": "And I think Bitcoin fixes this because it allows us to have money that has the salability of gold across time, meaning it holds its value across time like gold, but much better than gold."}, {"time": 9058, "text": "But also it is similar to fiat in that fiat can travel quickly, but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat."}, {"time": 9066,

define the word salability?"}, {"time": 9080, "text": "Salability is the essential property of money."}, {"time": 9082, "text": "It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,

house, you can just click a button and sell a house and have a giant market of people buying houses from you."}, {"time": 9101, "text": "You need to find somebody who wants the exact house that you have with the exact specifications that you have."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "And because houses are not identical, there's no liquid giant market for people to just buy and sell identical houses from."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "So gold, for instance, has good salability as money because it's a liquid good, it's uniform, and people are always buying it."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "Fiat dollars have great salability because everybody's always buying and exchanging dollars for other goods."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "So if you have $100 bill, you can easily get rid of it and you'll get $100 worth of stuff for it."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "If you have $100 worth of stuff, it's harder to get rid of it."}, {"time": 9142, "text": "If you have $100 worth of phone, it's not as easy to spend it as a $100 bill."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "That's salability."}, {"time": 9148, "text": "What do you mean that Bitcoin, I understand that Bitcoin has the salability of gold across time."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "Better even, yeah."}, {"time": 9156, "text": "Better, yes, like on the order or whatever."}, {"time": 9159, "text": "And then it has the salability of fiat across space."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "So if you remember when you asked me what is the advantage of fiat, what is the advantage it offers us, it's cheaper to move fiat across space than it is to move gold."}, {"time": 9172, "text": "With the current fiat monetary system, for all of its flaws, you can send money, I could send money from my bank account in the US to a bank account in China in a couple of days, or in Britain, in France, in a day or two, which is much faster than you could do with gold and much cheaper than you could do with gold."}, {"time": 9193, "text": "But in reality, with fiat, the reason Bitcoin improves on that is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling, you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours."}, {"time": 9203, "text": "So you send the Bitcoin transaction, you get six confirmations in an hour, you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average."}, {"time": 9209, "text": "With 12 confirmations, you're pretty definitely clearly safe on this."}, {"time": 9216, "text": "So within a couple of hours, you could send a billion dollars across the ocean and have final settlement on them."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation that's gonna need weeks and months to settle, which is the case with fiat."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "So it is faster than fiat, effectively."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat."}, {"time": 9236, "text": "That's a good way of putting it."}, {"time": 9240, "text": "One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask, to me on a human level, it's fascinating, is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous founder, there's no leader."}, {"time": 9252, "text": "So that's another aspect of the decentralization is leaderless."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "So

the fact that he's not there."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "And this is what's truly astonishing about it."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "The most important fact in Bitcoin is the fact that the creators

important thing."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "And maybe he died or she died or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever and that's why they haven't accessed their coins."}, {"time": 9351,

and get all of the people who are interested in the technology to get into it."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "And so that's an enormous advantage, but the cherry on top or what made the whole thing really

"Okay, let me just ask you about some possible criticisms of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9709, "text": "So on centralization, so there's a criticism on the mining and on the node side, or the node is not really the criticism, but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized because a small number of miners control a majority of the hashing power."}, {"time": 9726, "text": "I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000, whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes, that have the full, that are actively connected to the network."}, {"time": 9736, "text": "So you could argue that's decentralized because it's global, it's all across the world, but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "So if you're thinking of making a case for Bitcoin being decentralized, do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?"}, {"time": 9754, "text": "Is the nodes the important thing to think about?"}, {"time": 9758, "text": "And what number of nodes counts as centralized and not?"}, {"time": 9762, "text": "The nodes are what matters because the nodes are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters."}, {"time": 9766, "text": "I think the best way to think about it is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem so they keep operating their computers until they can get a solution to the problem."}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify and approve it."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "So therefore, this is, and this is, I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard, but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer."}, {"time": 9810, "text": "It's a great description of, in 2017, essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "But they thought that they could pass this change, they could force this change on the network."}, {"time": 9850, "text": "And the members of the network rejected it and they weren't able to do it."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "So the nodes are what is sovereign."}, {"time": 9857, "text": "The nodes are what determine the rules of the game."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "The miners are a service provider."}, {"time": 9863, "text": "The miners invest capital upfront."}, {"time": 9865, "text": "You know, they buy the machines, they buy the electricity, they buy the storage, they buy the locations, they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money based on the idea that if they behave according to what the nodes want, the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9882, "text": "So the miners are in no position to dictate terms for anyone."}, {"time": 9885, "text": "You know, they've put up their capital upfront and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "So therefore what really matters is the decentralization of the nodes."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "So we wanna, you wanna have as many nodes as possible."}, {"time": 9897, "text": "You should, you wanna have a system where there's a large number of nodes."}, {"time": 9901, "text": "And this is of course the biggest problem with other digital currencies is that, you know, because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market on a digital currency, the only way that you can really get traction is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords about, you know, we're doing this and we're doing that."}, {"time": 9920, "text": "And so other digital currencies are optimized for bells and whistles and buzzwords."}, {"time": 9927, "text": "And that means adding computational load, which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate, and therefore you have a very small number of nodes."}, {"time": 9935, "text": "In fact, very few digital currencies are keen to publicize how many nodes there are, and they don't have full nodes in the true sense."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes tomorrow on AWS, doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 9957, "text": "What matters is de facto do the nodes dictate the rules of consensus."}, {"time": 9962, "text": "And the fact that with most digital currencies you can have hard forks very frequently and they can change the supply all the time means that there's a small group of people who agree amongst themselves how to move forward."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there."}, {"time": 9975, "text": "So one is the small group."}, {"time": 9977, "text": "That one we could talk about."}, {"time": 9978, "text": "It's a tricky one, and we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "But the other one is small number of nodes sort of to push back on that."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "As computational power increases, you can argue that that enables more and more cheap computers to serve as nodes."}, {"time": 9995, "text": "So at least it paints a future where nodes are always increasing because computational power is always increasing and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper."}, {"time": 10004, "text": "So at least there's a hope for the future for greater and greater decentralization on the node front."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again, it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have if the way that the currency is run is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months, which is the case with most other currencies."}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Bitcoin's the only one that's not have a hard fork."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin in a technical sense is that you could get the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009 to start the network."}, {"time": 10038, "text": "And you could run it today and it would sync with the blockchain."}, {"time": 10043, "text": "There's one bug you need to fix, one mistake that would have only appeared I think in around 2013 or 14 or something like that, so that he wasn't aware of back then."}, {"time": 10053, "text": "So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug."}, {"time": 10055, "text": "And then the consensus parameters are still the same."},

they've all had many hard forks, which they think of as upgrades."}, {"time": 10066, "text": "And they market this thing as, well, Bitcoin can't upgrade, but we upgrade all the time."}, {"time": 10072, "text": "Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?"}, {"time": 10075, "text": "Facebook, Apple, Amazon, anything that centralizes is very easy to upgrade."}, {"time": 10079, "text":

likely scenario, but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks what they want is what's gonna happen."}, {"time": 13633, "text": "I think we're just gonna witness the same relationship because

in, you know, the programming code."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And then of course, once you start doing that, you start adjusting it and then making your own games."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And that's

all my coding skills."}, {"time": 651, "text": "And when did you fall in love with AI?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "So when did you first start to gain an understanding that you can not just write

769, "text": "This thing came out in 1984 or something."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So I must've got it when I was about 11, 12."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And it explained fully how these chess programs were made."}, {"time": 776, "text": "And I remember my first AI program being programming my Amiga."}, {"time": 780, "text": "It couldn't, it wasn't powerful enough to play chess."}, {"time": 782,

millions of copies around the world."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And people loved the way that the AI, even though it was relatively simple by today's AI standards, was reacting to the way you as the

"So a million questions just as a brief tangent."}, {"time": 858, "text": "Well, look, I think games have been significant in my life for three reasons."}, {"time": 863, "text": "So first of all, I was playing them and training myself on games when I was a kid."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Then I went through a phase of designing games and writing AI for games."}, {"time": 873, "text": "So all the games I professionally wrote had AI as a core component."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And that was mostly in the 90s."}, {"time": 880, "text": "And the reason I was doing that in games industry was at the time the games industry, I think was the cutting edge of technology."}, {"time": 887, "text": "So whether it was graphics with people like John Carmack and Quake and those kinds of things or AI, I think actually all the action was going on in games."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like GPUs, which I find ironic was obviously invented for graphics, computer graphics, but then turns out to be amazingly useful for AI."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication it appears in the whole world."}, {"time": 911, "text": "So I think games at the time had the most cutting edge AI."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And a lot of the games, I was involved in writing."}, {"time": 919, "text": "So there was a game called Black and White, which was one game I was involved with in the early stages of, which I still think is the most impressive example of reinforcement learning in a computer game."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So in that game, you trained a little pet animal and..."}, {"time": 934, "text": "It's a brilliant game."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And it sort of learned from how you were treating it."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So if you treated it badly, then it became mean."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And then it would be mean to your villagers and your population, the sort of the little tribe that you were running."}, {"time": 947, "text": "But if you were kind to it, then it would be kind."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And people were fascinated by how that works."}, {"time": 951, "text": "And so was I to be honest with the way it kind of developed."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Especially the mapping to good and evil."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Made you realize, made me realize that you can sort of in the choices you make can define where you end up."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And that means all of us are capable of the good, evil."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It all matters in the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make."}, {"time": 979, "text": "I mean, games can do that philosophically to you."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And it's rare."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It seems rare."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Well, games are, I think, a unique medium because you as the player, you're not just passively consuming the entertainment, right?"}, {"time": 990, "text": "You're actually actively involved as an agent."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So I think that's what makes it in some ways can be more visceral than other mediums like films and books."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So the second, so that was designing AI in games."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And then the third use we've used of AI is in DeepMind from the beginning, which is using games as a testing ground for proving out AI algorithms and developing AI algorithms."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And that was a sort of a core component of our vision at the start of DeepMind was that we would use games very heavily as our main testing ground, certainly to begin with, because it's super efficient to use games."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And also, it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand, there's already a strong set of rules."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Like it's already a damn good benchmark."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yes, it's really good for so many reasons because you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And in some cases like Go, we've been playing it for thousands of years and often they have scores or at least win conditions."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's very easy to specify what that reward is."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And also at the end, it's easy to test externally at how strong is your system by of course, playing against the world's strongest players at those games."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "So it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run potentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So I think there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in starting out 2010, how come we were able to progress so quickly because we've utilized games."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And at the beginning of DeepMind, we also hired some amazing game engineers who I knew from my previous lives in the games industry."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And that helped to bootstrap us very quickly."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine over a chess board or a Go board."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And especially given that the entire history of AI is defined by people saying it's gonna be impossible to make a machine that beats a human being in chess."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then once that happened, people were certain when I was coming up in AI that Go is not a game that can be solved because of the combinatorial complexity is just too, it's no matter how much Moore's law you have, compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of Go."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And so then there's something compelling about facing, sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the AI researcher perspective, engineer perspective, and then as a human being, just observing this whole thing."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Your beliefs about what you thought was impossible being broken apart, it's humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "It's humbling to realize that the things we think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "There's something really powerful about a game, AI system beating human being in a game that drives that message home for like millions, billions of people, especially in the case of Go."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Well, look, I think it's, I mean, it has been a fascinating journey and especially as I think about it from, I can understand it from both sides, both as the AI, creators of the AI, but also as a games player originally."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So, it was a really interesting, I mean, it was a fantastic, but also somewhat bittersweet moment, the AlphaGo match for me, seeing that and being obviously heavily involved in that."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "But as you say, chess has been the, I mean, Kasparov, I think rightly called it the Drosophila of intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So, it's sort of, I love that phrase and I think he's right because chess has been hand in hand with AI from the beginning of the whole field, right?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So, I think every AI practitioner, starting with Turing and Claude Shannon and all those, the sort of forefathers of the field, tried their hand at writing a chess program."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I've got original edition of Claude Shannon's first chess program, I think it was 1949, the original sort of paper."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And they all did that and Turing famously wrote a chess program, but all the computers around them were obviously too slow to run it."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So, he had to run, he had to be the computer, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So, he literally, I think spent two or three days running his own program by hand with pencil and paper and playing a friend of his with his chess program."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So, of course, Deep Blue was a huge moment, beating Kasparov, but actually when that happened, I remember that very vividly, of course, because it was chess and computers and AI, all the things I loved and I was at college at the time."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "But I remember coming away from that, being more impressed by Kasparov's mind than I was by Deep Blue."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Because here was Kasparov with his human mind, not only could he play chess more or less to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine, but of course, Kasparov can do everything else humans can do, ride a bike, talk many languages, do politics, all the rest of the amazing things that Kasparov does."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And so, with the same brain."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And yet Deep Blue, brilliant as it was at chess, it'd been hand coded for chess and actually had distilled the knowledge of chess grandmasters into a cool program, but it couldn't do anything else."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "It couldn't even play a strictly simpler game like tic tac toe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So, something to me was missing from intelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I think it was this idea of generality and also learning."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So, and that's obviously what we tried to do with AlphaGo."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Yeah, with AlphaGo and AlphaZero, MuZero, and then God and all the things that we'll get into some parts of, there's just a fascinating trajectory here."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But let's just stick on chess briefly."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "On the human side of chess, you've proposed that from a game design perspective, the thing that makes chess compelling as a game is that there's a creative tension between a bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Can you explain this?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "First of all, it's really interesting to think about what makes a game compelling, makes it stick across centuries."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Yeah, I was sort of thinking about this, and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a game's designer point of view."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "So, it's with my game design hat on that I was thinking about this, why is chess so compelling?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And I think a critical reason is the dynamicness of the different kind of chess positions you can have, whether they're closed or open and other things, comes from the bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "So, if you think about how different the capabilities of the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move, and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two capabilities more or less equally."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "So, they're both roughly worth three points each."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So, you think that dynamics is always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Well, maybe, I mean, it's sort of, I don't know, it's chicken and egg situation, probably both came together."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop and knight that are so different in power, but so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions, right?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years, I think gives the game the creative tension that you can swap the bishop and knights for a bishop for a knight, and they're more or less worth the same, but now you aim for a different type of position."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "If you have the knight, you want a closed position."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "If you have the bishop, you want an open position."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So, I think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So, some kind of controlled creative tension."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "From an AI perspective, do you think AI systems could eventually design games that are optimally compelling to humans?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Sometimes I get asked about AI and creativity, and the way I answered that is relevant to that question, which is that I think there are different levels of creativity, one could say."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So, I think if we define creativity as coming up with something original, right, that's useful for a purpose, then I think the kind of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "So, an averaging of all the examples you see."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So, maybe a very basic AI system could say you could have that."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So, you show it millions of pictures of cats, and then you say, give me an average looking cat, right?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Generate me an average looking cat."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I would call that interpolation."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Then there's extrapolation, which something like AlphaGo showed."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So, AlphaGo played millions of games of Go against itself, and then it came up with brilliant new ideas like Move 37 in game two, brilliant motif strategies in Go that no humans had ever thought of, even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So, that I call that extrapolation, but then there's still a level above that, which is, you could call out of the box thinking or true innovation, which is, could you invent Go, right?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move or brilliant Go move, but can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or Go?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And I think one day AI could, but then what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a program right now?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And the way I would do it if I was telling a human to do it or a human games designer to do it is I would say, something like Go, I would say, come up with a game that only takes five minutes to learn, which Go does because it's got simple rules, but many lifetimes to master, right?"}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Or impossible to master in one lifetime because it's so deep and so complex."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And then it's aesthetically beautiful."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And also it can be completed in three or four hours of gameplay time, which is useful for us in a human day."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And so you might specify these sort of high level concepts like that, and then with that and then maybe a few other things, one could imagine that Go satisfies those constraints."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But the problem is that we're not able to specify abstract notions like that, high level abstract notions like that yet to our AI systems."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And I think there's still something missing there in terms of high level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and they're combinable and compositional."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So for the moment, I think AI is capable of doing interpolation and extrapolation, but not true invention."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So coming up with rule sets and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets, we can't currently do."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "But you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self play experiment to see how long, just observe how an AI system from scratch learns, how long is that journey of learning?"}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on, and you could see a long journey to master for even an AI system, then you could say that this is a promising game."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "But it would be nice to do almost like AlphaCode so programming rules."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So generating rules that automate even that part of the generation of rules."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So I have thought about systems actually that I think would be amazing for a games designer."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "If you could have a system that takes your game, plays it tens of millions of times, maybe overnight, and then self balances the rules better."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So it tweaks the rules and maybe the equations and the parameters so that the game is more balanced, the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So it's a bit of like giving a base set and then allowing Monte Carlo Tree Search or something like that to sort of explore it."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And I think that would be super powerful tool actually for balancing, auto balancing a game, which usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of human games testers normally to balance a game like StarCraft, which is Blizzard are amazing at balancing their games, but it takes them years and years and years."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So one could imagine at some point when this stuff becomes efficient enough to you might be able to do that like overnight."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Do you think a game that is optimal designed by an AI system would look very much like a planet earth?"}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Maybe, maybe it's only the sort of game I would love to make is, and I've tried in my games career, the games design career, my first big game was designing a theme park, an amusement park."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Then with games like Republic, I tried to have games where we designed whole cities and allowed you to play in."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So, and of course people like Will Wright have written games like SimEarth, trying to simulate the whole of earth, pretty tricky, but I think."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "SimEarth, I haven't actually played that one."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Does it incorporate of evolution or?"}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Yeah, it has evolution and it sort of tries to, it sort of treats it as an entire biosphere, but from quite high level."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "It'd be nice to be able to sort of zoom in, zoom out and zoom in."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "So obviously it couldn't do, that was in the 90s."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "I think he wrote that in the 90s."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "So it couldn't, it wasn't able to do that, but that would be obviously the ultimate sandbox game."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "On that topic, do you think we're living in a simulation?"}, {"time": 1804, "text": "Yes, well, so, okay."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So I."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "We're gonna jump around from the absurdly philosophical to the technical."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Sure, sure, very, very happy to."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So I think my answer to that question is a little bit complex because there is simulation theory, which obviously Nick Bostrom, I think famously first proposed."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And I don't quite believe it in that sense."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "So in the sense that are we in some sort of computer game or have our descendants somehow recreated earth in the 21st century and some, for some kind of experimental reason."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "I think that, but I do think that we, that we might be, that the best way to understand physics and the universe is from a computational perspective."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So understanding it as an information universe and actually information being the most fundamental unit of reality rather than matter or energy."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "So a physicist would say, you know, matter or energy, you know, E equals MC squared."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "These are the things that are the fundamentals of the universe."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "I'd actually say information, which of course itself can be, can specify energy or matter, right?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Matter is actually just, you know, we're just out the way our bodies and the molecules in our body are arranged as information."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "So I think information may be the most fundamental way to describe the universe."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And therefore you could say we're in some sort of simulation because of that."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "But I don't, I do, I'm not, I'm not really a subscriber to the idea that, you know, these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "I think this is actually very critical and possibly unique, this simulation."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "This particular one."},

the human mind does."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "And I'm kind of in awe of it really."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And I think it's amazing that with our human minds, we're able to build things like

building blocks of biology that I think is another angle at which you can start to understand the human mind, the human body, which is quite fascinating, which is from the basic building blocks, start to simulate, start to model how from those building blocks, you can construct bigger and bigger, more complex systems, maybe one day the entirety of the human biology."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So here's another problem that thought to be impossible to solve, which is protein folding."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "And Alpha Fold or specifically Alpha Fold 2 did just that."}, {"time": 2268, "text":

level, what is it and how does it work?"}, {"time": 2284, "text": "And then we can ask some fascinating questions after."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So maybe to explain it to people not familiar with protein folding is, you know, first of all, explain proteins, which is, you know, proteins are essential to all life."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "Every function in your body depends on proteins."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Sometimes they're called the workhorses of biology."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "And if you look into them and I've, you know, obviously as part of Alpha Fold, I've been

little videos of how they work, animations of how they work."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And proteins are specified by their genetic sequence called the amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "So you can think of it as their genetic makeup."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And then in the body in nature, they fold up into a 3D structure."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "So you can think of it as a string of beads and then they fold up into a ball."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "Now, the key thing is you want to know what that 3D structure is because the structure, the 3D structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it do, the function it does in your body."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also if you're interested in drugs or disease, you need to understand that 3D structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound about to block something the protein's doing, you need to understand where it's gonna bind on the surface of the protein."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So obviously in order to do that, you need to understand the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "So the structure is mapped to the function."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "The structure is mapped to the function and the structure is obviously somehow specified by the amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And that's the, in essence, the protein folding problem is, can you just from the amino acid sequence, the one dimensional string of letters, can you immediately computationally predict the 3D structure?"}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And this has been a grand challenge in biology for over 50 years."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So I think it was first articulated by Christian Anfinsen, a Nobel prize winner in 1972, as part of his Nobel prize winning lecture."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And he just speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3D structure, but he didn't say how."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "So it's been described to me as equivalent to Fermat's last theorem, but for biology."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "You should, as somebody that very well might win the Nobel prize in the future."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "But outside of that, you should do more of that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "In the margin, just put random things that will take like 200 years to solve."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "Set people off for 200 years."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "It should be possible."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And just don't give any details."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "I think everyone exactly should be, I'll have to remember that for future."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "So yeah, so he set off, you know, with this one throwaway remark, just like Fermat, you know, he set off this whole 50 year field really of computational biology."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And they had, you know, they got stuck."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "They hadn't really got very far with doing this."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And until now, until AlphaFold came along, this is done experimentally, right?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "Very painstakingly."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So the rule of thumb is, and you have to like crystallize the protein, which is really difficult."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "And then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or X ray crystallography machines."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Really painstaking work to get the 3D structure and visualize the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So the rule of thumb in experimental biology is that it takes one PhD student, their entire PhD to do one protein."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And with AlphaFold 2, we were able to predict the 3D structure in a matter of seconds."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And so we were, you know, over Christmas, we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human body or 20,000 proteins."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So the human proteomes like the equivalent of the human genome, but on protein space."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And sort of revolutionized really what a structural biologist can do."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Because now they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimental, should they put all of that effort in or not?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "They can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a Google search."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "And so there's a data set on which it's trained and how to map this amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "First of all, it's incredible that a protein, this little chemical computer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "That's a weird thing."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "And they evolve that way because, you know, in the beginning, I mean, that's a great invention, just the protein itself."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And then there's, I think, probably a history of like they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to form high level functions."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I mean, it's a weird system that they figured it out."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too, but proteins themselves, I think are magical and incredible, as I said, little bio nano machines."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And actually Leventhal, who was another scientist, a contemporary of Amphinson, he coined this Leventhal, what became known as Leventhal's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "He calculated roughly an average protein, which is maybe 2000 amino acids base as long, is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different confirmations."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "So there's 10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "And yet somehow in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of milliseconds."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in fractions of a second."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So physics is somehow solving that search problem."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And just to be clear, in many of these cases, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "So among that huge number of possibilities, it figures out a way how to stably, in some cases there might be a misfunction, so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "But most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Which is what the problem is."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "Exactly, so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy, if it's healthy, and as you say in disease, so for example, Alzheimer's, one conjecture is that it's because of misfolded protein, a protein that folds in the wrong way, amyloid beta protein."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So, and then because it folds in the wrong way, it gets tangled up, right, in your neurons."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also disease is to understand, you know, what these things are doing and how they're structuring."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Of course, the next step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "So they're not just static necessarily in biology."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "Maybe you can give some interesting, so beautiful things to you about these early days of AlphaFold, of solving this problem, because unlike games, this is real physical systems that are less amenable to self play type of mechanisms."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "The size of the data set is smaller than you might otherwise like, so you have to be very clever about certain things."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "Is there something you could speak to what was very hard to solve and what are some beautiful aspects about the solution?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Yeah, I would say AlphaFold is the most complex and also probably most meaningful system we've built so far."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So it's been an amazing time actually in the last, you know, two, three years to see that come through because as we talked about earlier, you know, games is what we started on building things like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, but really the ultimate goal was to, not just to crack games, it was just to build, use them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Specifically, my passion is scientific challenges like protein folding."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "And then AlphaFold of course is our first big proof point of that."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And so, you know, in terms of the data and the amount of innovations that had to go into it, we, you know, it was like more than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "I think some of the big innovations were that kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and evolutionary biology to constrain sort of things like the bond angles in the protein and things like that, a lot, but not to impact the learning system."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "So still allowing the system to be able to learn the physics itself from the examples that we had."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And the examples, as you say, there are only about 150,000 proteins, even after 40 years of experimental biology, only around 150,000 proteins have been, the structures have been found out about."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So that was our training set, which is much less than normally we would like to use, but using various tricks, things like self distillation."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "So actually using AlphaFold predictions, some of the best predictions that it thought was highly confident in, we put them back into the training set, right?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "To make the training set bigger, that was critical to AlphaFold working."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So there was actually a huge number of different innovations like that, that were required to ultimately crack the problem."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "AlphaFold one, what it produced was a distrogram."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances between all of the molecules in the protein."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And then there had to be a separate optimization process to create the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "And what we did for AlphaFold two is make it truly end to end."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So we went straight from the amino acid sequence of bases to the 3D structure directly without going through this intermediate step."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And in machine learning, what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make it, the better the system."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And it's probably because in the end, the system's better at learning what the constraints are than we are as the human designers of specifying it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for, in this case, the 3D structure, you're better off than having this intermediate step, which you then have to handcraft the next step for."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system from the end point, the end output you want to the inputs."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So that's a good way to start on a new problem."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "Handcraft a bunch of stuff, add a bunch of manual constraints with a small end to end learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece until it consumes the whole thing."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "And so you can also see, this is a bit of a method we've developed over doing many sort of successful alpha, we call them alpha X projects, right?"}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alpha go to alpha zero."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So alpha go was a learning system, but it was specifically trained to only play go, right?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and what we wanted to do with first version of alpha go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it, right?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And then of course, alpha go zero, we remove the need to use human games as a starting point, right?"}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So that removed the need for human knowledge about go."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And then finally alpha zero then generalized it so that any things we had in there, the system, including things like symmetry of the go board were removed."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu zero, which is the final, our latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It would learn that for itself."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "So it could also deal with computer games as well as board games."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "So that line of alpha go, alpha go zero, alpha zero, mu zero, that's the full trajectory of what you can take from imitation learning to full self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And learning the entire structure of the environment you're put in from scratch, right?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And bootstrapping it through self play yourself."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "But the thing is it would have been impossible, I think, or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu zero first out of the box."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "Even psychologically, because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "You're constantly dealing with doubt because a lot of people say that it's impossible."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Exactly, so it's hard enough just to do go."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "As you were saying, everyone thought that was impossible or at least a decade away from when we did it back in 2015, 2016."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And so yes, it would have been psychologically probably very difficult as well as the fact that of course we learn a lot by building alpha go first."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Right, so I think this is why I call AI an engineering science."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "It's one of the most fascinating science disciplines, but it's also an engineering science in the sense that unlike natural sciences, the phenomenon you're studying doesn't exist out in nature."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "You have to build it first."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So you have to build the artifact first, and then you can study and pull it apart and how it works."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "This is tough to ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything, but let's try to think through this because you're in a very interesting position where DeepMind is a place of some of the most brilliant ideas in the history of AI, but it's also a place of brilliant engineering."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "So how much of solving intelligence, this big goal for DeepMind, how much of it is science?"}, {"time": 3072, "text": "How much is engineering?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "So how much is the algorithms?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "How much is the data?"}, {"time": 3076, "text": "How much is the hardware compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "How much is it the software compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "How much is the human infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And like just the humans interacting certain kinds of ways in all the space of all those ideas."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And how much is maybe like philosophy?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "How much, what's the key?"}, {"time": 3095, "text": "If you were to sort of look back, like if we go forward 200 years and look back, what was the key thing that solved intelligence?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Is it the ideas or the engineering?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "I think it's a combination."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "First of all, of course, it's a combination of all those things, but the ratios of them changed over time."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "So even in the last 12 years, so we started DeepMind in 2010, which is hard to imagine now because 2010, it's only 12 short years ago, but nobody was talking about AI."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "I don't know if you remember back to your MIT days, no one was talking about it."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I did a postdoc at MIT back around then."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And it was sort of thought of as a, well, look, we know AI doesn't work."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "We tried this hard in the 90s at places like MIT, mostly using logic systems and old fashioned, sort of good old fashioned AI, we would call it now."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "People like Minsky and Patrick Winston, and you know all these characters, right?"}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And used to debate a few of them."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And they used to think I was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with learning systems."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "And I was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at that point, right?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Even if all of your professors are telling you you're mad."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And of course in industry, we couldn't get, it was difficult to get two cents together, which is hard to imagine now as well, given that it's the biggest sort of buzzword in VCs and fundraisings easy and all these kinds of things today."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "So back in 2010, it was very difficult."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "And the reason we started then, and Shane and I used to discuss what were the sort of founding tenants of DeepMind."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "And it was various things."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "One was algorithmic advances."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So deep learning, you know, Jeff Hinton and Co had just sort of invented that in academia, but no one in industry knew about it."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "We love reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "We thought that could be scaled up."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "But also understanding about the human brain had advanced quite a lot in the decade prior with fMRI machines and other things."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and sort of representations maybe that the brain uses."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So at a systems level, not at a implementation level."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And then the other big things were compute and GPUs, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So we could see a compute was going to be really useful and had got to a place where it become commoditized mostly through the games industry and that could be taken advantage of."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "So things like AIXI, AIXE, which Shane worked on with his supervisor, Marcus Hutter, which is this sort of theoretical proof really of universal intelligence, which is actually a reinforcement learning system in the limit."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I mean, it assumes infinite compute and infinite memory in the way, you know, like a Turing machine proves."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "But I was also waiting to see something like that too, to, you know, like Turing machines and computation theory that people like Turing and Shannon came up with underpins modern computer science."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "You know, I was waiting for a theory like that to sort of underpin AGI research."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "So when I, you know, met Shane and saw he was working on something like that, you know, that to me was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So in the early days, I would say that ideas were the most important."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "You know, for us, it was deep reinforcement learning, scaling up deep learning."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "Of course, we've seen transformers."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "So huge leaps, I would say, you know, three or four from, if you think from 2010 till now, huge evolutions, things like AlphaGo."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "And maybe there's a few more still needed."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "But as we get closer to AI, AGI, I think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the recent, you know, results of GPT3 and all the big language models and large models, including our ones, has shown that scale and large models are clearly gonna be a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient part of an AGI solution."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And throughout that, like you said, and I'd like to give you a big thank you."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "You're one of the pioneers in this is sticking by ideas like reinforcement learning, that this can actually work given actually limited success in the past."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And also, which we still don't know, but proudly having the best researchers in the world and talking about solving intelligence."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So talking about whatever you call it, AGI or something like this, speaking of MIT, that's just something you wouldn't bring up."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Not maybe you did in like 40, 50 years ago, but that was, AI was a place where you do tinkering, very small scale, not very ambitious projects."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And maybe the biggest ambitious projects were in the space of robotics and doing like the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "But the task of solving intelligence and believing you can, that's really, really powerful."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "So in order for engineering to do its work, to have great engineers, build great systems, you have to have that belief, that threads throughout the whole thing that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "And back in 2010, our mission statement and still is today, it was used to be solving step one, solve intelligence, step two, use it to solve everything else."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "So if you can imagine pitching that to a VC in 2010, the kind of looks we got, we managed to find a few kooky people to back us, but it was tricky."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "And it got to the point where we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we committed career suicide."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "And so it was, there's a lot of things that we had to do, but we always believed it."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "And one reason, by the way, one reason I've always believed in reinforcement learning is that if you look at neuroscience, that is the way that the primate brain learns."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "One of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system implements some form of TD learning."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "It was a very famous result in the late 90s where they saw this in monkeys and as a propagating prediction error."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So again, in the limit, this is what I think you can use neuroscience for is, at mathematics, when you're doing something as ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and it's blue sky research, no one knows how to do it, you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "So that was one reason we pushed so hard on that."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "And just going back to your earlier question about organization, the other big thing that I think we innovated with at DeepMind to encourage invention and innovation was the multidisciplinary organization we built and we still have today."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So DeepMind originally was a confluence of the most cutting edge knowledge in neuroscience with machine learning, engineering and mathematics, right?"}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And gaming."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And then since then we've built that out even further."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "So we have philosophers here and ethicists, but also other types of scientists, physicists and so on."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And that's what brings together, I tried to build a sort of new type of Bell Labs, but in its golden era, right?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "And a new expression of that to try and foster this incredible sort of innovation machine."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So talking about the humans in the machine, DeepMind itself is a learning machine with lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these learning systems."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "If we return to the big ambitious dream of AlphaFold, that may be the early steps on a very long journey in biology, do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological systems?"}, {"time": 3558, "text": "So multi protein interaction, and then, I mean, you can go out from there, just simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body, just the big mush, the mess of the beautiful, resilient mess of biology."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "Do you see that as a long term vision?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "I do, and I think, if you think about what are the top things I wanted to apply AI to once we had powerful enough systems, biology and curing diseases and understanding biology was right up there, top of my list."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "That's one of the reasons I personally pushed that myself and with AlphaFold, but I think AlphaFold, amazing as it is, is just the beginning."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And I hope it's evidence of what could be done with computational methods."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "So AlphaFold solved this huge problem of the structure of proteins, but biology is dynamic."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So really what I imagine from here, and we're working on all these things now, is protein, protein interaction, protein ligand binding, so reacting with molecules, then you wanna build up to pathways, and then eventually a virtual cell."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "That's my dream, maybe in the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And I've been talking actually to a lot of biologists, friends of mine, Paul Nurse, who runs the Crick Institute, amazing biologists, Nobel Prize winning biologists."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "We've been discussing for 20 years now, virtual cells."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Could you build a virtual simulation of a cell?"}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And if you could, that would be incredible for biology and disease discovery, because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell, and then only at the last stage, validate it in the wet lab."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So you could, in terms of the search space of discovering new drugs, it takes 10 years roughly to go from identifying a target, to having a drug candidate."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "Maybe that could be shortened by an order of magnitude, if you could do most of that work in silico."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So in order to get to a virtual cell, we have to build up understanding of different parts of biology and the interactions."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "And so every few years we talk about this, I talked about this with Paul."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "And then finally, last year after AlphaFold, I said, now's the time we can finally go for it."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And AlphaFold is the first proof point that this might be possible."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And he's very excited, and we have some collaborations with his lab, they're just across the road actually from us, it's wonderful being here in King's Cross with the Crick Institute across the road."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And I think the next steps, I think there's gonna be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like AlphaFold."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "We're already seeing that with the community doing that after we've open sourced it and released it."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "And I often say that I think if you think of mathematics is the perfect description language for physics, I think AI might be end up being the perfect description language for biology because biology is so messy, it's so emergent, so dynamic and complex."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "I think I find it very hard to believe we'll ever get to something as elegant as Newton's laws of motions to describe a cell, right?"}, {"time": 3741, "text": "It's just too complicated."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So I think AI is the right tool for that."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "So you have to start at the basic building blocks and use AI to run the simulation for all those building blocks."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "So have a very strong way to do prediction of what given these building blocks, what kind of biology, how the function and the evolution of that biological system."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "It's almost like a cellular automata, you have to run it, you can't analyze it from a high level."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "You have to take the basic ingredients, figure out the rules and let it run."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "But in this case, the rules are very difficult to figure out, you have to learn them."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "So the biology is too complicated to figure out the rules."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "It's too emergent, too dynamic, say compared to a physics system, like the motion of a planet, right?"}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so you have to learn the rules and that's exactly the type of systems that we're building."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "So you mentioned you've open sourced AlphaFold and even the data involved."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "To me personally, also really happy and a big thank you for open sourcing Mojoko, the physics simulation engine that's often used for robotics research and so on."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "So I think that's a pretty gangster move."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "So what's the, I mean, very few companies or people do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "What's the philosophy behind that?"}, {"time": 3821, "text": "You know, it's a case by case basis."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "And in both of those cases, we felt that was the maximum benefit to humanity to do that."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And the scientific community, in one case, the robotics physics community with Mojoko, so."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "We purchased it."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "We purchased it for, yes, we purchased it for the express principle to open source it."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "So, you know, I hope people appreciate that."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "It's great to hear that you do."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "And then the second thing was, and mostly we did it because the person building it was not able to cope with supporting it anymore because it got too big for him."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "He's an amazing professor who built it in the first place."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "So we helped him out with that."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And then with AlphaFold is even bigger, I would say."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And I think in that case, we decided that there were so many downstream applications of AlphaFold that we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "So the best way to accelerate drug discovery and also fundamental research would be to give all that data away and the system itself."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "You know, it's been so gratifying to see what people have done that within just one year, which is a short amount of time in science."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And it's been used by over 500,000 researchers have used it."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "We think that's almost every biologist in the world."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I think there's roughly 500,000 biologists in the world, professional biologists, have used it to look at their proteins of interest."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "We've seen amazing fundamental research done."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "So a couple of weeks ago, front cover, there was a whole special issue of science, including the front cover, which had the nuclear pore complex on it, which is one of the biggest proteins in the body."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "The nuclear pore complex is a protein that governs all the nutrients going in and out of your cell nucleus."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "So they're like little gateways that open and close to let things go in and out of your cell nucleus."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "So they're really important, but they're huge because they're massive donut ring shaped things."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "And they've been looking to try and figure out that structure for decades."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "And they have lots of experimental data, but it's too low resolution, there's bits missing."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And they were able to, like a giant Lego jigsaw puzzle, use alpha fold predictions plus experimental data and combined those two independent sources of information, actually four different groups around the world were able to put it together more or less simultaneously using alpha fold predictions."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So that's been amazing to see."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "And pretty much every pharma company, every drug company executive I've spoken to has said that their teams are using alpha fold to accelerate whatever drugs they're trying to discover."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So I think the knock on effect has been enormous in terms of the impact that alpha fold has made."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And it's probably bringing in, it's creating biologists, it's bringing more people into the field, both on the excitement and both on the technical skills involved in, it's almost like a gateway drug to biology."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "And to get more computational people involved too, hopefully."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "And I think for us, the next stage, as I said, in future we have to have other considerations too."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "We're building on top of alpha fold and these other ideas I discussed with you about protein interactions and genomics and other things."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "And not everything will be open source."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "Some of it we'll do commercially because that will be the best way to actually get the most resources and impact behind it."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "In other ways, some other projects we'll do nonprofit style."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "And also we have to consider for future things as well, safety and ethics as well."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "Like synthetic biology, there is dual use."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "And we have to think about that as well."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "With alpha fold, we consulted with 30 different bioethicists and other people expert in this field to make sure it was safe before we released it."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So there'll be other considerations in future."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "But for right now, I think alpha fold is a kind of a gift from us to the scientific community."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "So I'm pretty sure that something like alpha fold will be part of Nobel prizes in the future."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "But us humans, of course, are horrible with credit assignment."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So we'll of course give it to the humans."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Do you think there will be a day when AI system can't be denied that it earned that Nobel prize?"}, {"time": 4065, "text": "Do you think we will see that in 21st century?"}, {"time": 4067, "text": "It depends what type of AIs we end up building, right?"}, {"time": 4070, "text": "Whether they're goal seeking agents who specifies the goals, who comes up with the hypotheses, who determines which problems to tackle, right?"}, {"time": 4080, "text": "So I think... And tweets about it, announcement of the results."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "Yes, and tweets about results exactly as part of it."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "So I think right now, of course, it's amazing human ingenuity that's behind these systems."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And then the system, in my opinion, is just a tool."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "Be a bit like saying with Galileo and his telescope, the ingenuity that the credit should go to the telescope."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "I mean, it's clearly Galileo building the tool which he then uses."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So I still see that in the same way today, even though these tools learn for themselves."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "There, I think of things like alpha fold and the things we're building as the ultimate tools for science and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists acquire new knowledge."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "I think one day there will come a point where an AI system may solve or come up with something like general relativity of its own bat, not just by averaging everything on the internet or averaging everything on PubMed, although that would be interesting to see what that would come up with."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "So that to me is a bit like our earlier debate about creativity, you know, inventing go rather than just coming up with a good go move."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And so I think solving, I think to, you know, if we wanted to give it the credit of like a Nobel type of thing, then it would need to invent go and sort of invent that new conjecture out of the blue rather than being specified by the human scientists or the human creators."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "So I think right now it's definitely just a tool."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Although it is interesting how far you get by averaging everything on the internet, like you said, because, you know, a lot of people do see science as you're always standing on the shoulders of giants."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "And the question is how much are you really reaching up above the shoulders of giants?"}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Maybe it's just simulating different kinds of results of the past with ultimately this new perspective that gives you this breakthrough idea."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "But that idea may not be novel in the way that it can't be already discovered on the internet."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "Maybe the Nobel prizes of the next 100 years are already all there on the internet to be discovered."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "They could be, they could be."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "I mean, I think this is one of the big mysteries, I think is that I, first of all, I believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs that are gonna come in the next few decades and even in the last decade are gonna come at the intersection between different subject areas where there'll be some new connection that's found between what seemingly were disparate areas."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "And one can even think of DeepMind, as I said earlier, as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and AI engineering ideas originally."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "And so I think there's that."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "And then one of the things we can't imagine today is, and one of the reasons I think people, we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that actually it's very hard for our human minds, our limited human minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole internet, right?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "I think we can do a thought experiment and I used to do this of like, well, what if I read the whole of Wikipedia?"}, {"time": 4257, "text": "What would I know?"}, {"time": 4258, "text": "And I think our minds can just about

jump?"}, {"time": 5954, "text": "It's very difficult, which is why I think it has only been done once from the sort of specialized brains that you see in animals to this sort of general purpose,

reason, the difficult thing, I think for us when we get, and I think this is a really interesting philosophical debate is when we get closer to AGI and, you know, and much more powerful systems than we have today, how are we going to make this judgment?"}, {"time": 6404, "text": "And one way, which is the Turing test is sort of a behavioral judgment, is the system exhibiting all the behaviors that a human sentient or a sentient being would exhibit?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "Is it answering the right questions?"}, {"time": 6418, "text": "Is it saying the right things?"}, {"time": 6419,

"Why do we think this?"}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And I debated this with Daniel Dennett."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "And I think there's a second reason that's often overlooked, which is that we're running on the same substrate, right?"}, {"time": 6438, "text": "So if we're exhibiting the same behavior, more or less as humans, and we're running on the same, you know, carbon based biological substrate, the squishy, you know, few pounds of flesh in our skulls, then the most parsimonious, I think, explanation is that you're feeling the same thing as I'm feeling, right?"}, {"time": 6455,

think they might be, because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And we know they're made of the same things, biological neurons."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "So we're gonna have to come up with explanations or models of the gap between substrate differences, between machines and humans to get anywhere beyond the behavioral."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "But to me, sort of the practical question is very interesting and very important."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "When you have millions, perhaps billions of people

before that, because we plan for success and however remote that looked like back in 2010."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental at DeepMind."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "And my current thinking on the language models and large models is they're not ready, we don't understand them well enough yet."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "And in terms of analysis tools and guard rails, what they can and can't do and so on, to deploy them at scale, because I think, there are big, still ethical questions like should an AI system always announce that it is an AI system to begin with?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "What do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings people may have about AI systems, perhaps incorrectly attributed?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "So I think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first to responsibly, before you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "That will be at least be my current position."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Over time, I'm very confident we'll have those tools like interpretability questions and analysis questions."},

theology, other things like that come into it, where arts and humanities, what does it mean to be human and the spirit of being human and to enhance that and the human condition, right?"}, {"time":

solve disease."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "So this is the era I think, this is the amazing era I think we're heading into if we do it right."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "But we've got to be careful."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "We've already seen with things like social media, how dual use technologies can be misused by, firstly, by bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors, right, so there's that set of just the common or garden misuse of existing dual use technology."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "And then of course, there's an additional thing that has to be overcome with AI that eventually it may have its own agency."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "So it could be good or bad in and of itself."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So I think these questions have to be approached very carefully using the scientific method, I would say, in terms of hypothesis generation, careful control testing, not live A, B testing out in the world, because with powerful technologies like AI, if something goes wrong, it may cause a lot of harm before you can fix it."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "It's not like an imaging app or game app where if something goes wrong, it's relatively easy to fix and the harm is relatively small."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So I think it comes with the usual cliche of, like with a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "And I think that's the case here with things like AI, given the enormous opportunity in front of us."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And I think we need a lot of voices and as many inputs into things like the design of the systems and the values they should have and what goals should they be put to."}, {"time": 6742, "text": "I think as wide a group of voices as possible beyond just the technologists is needed to input into that and to have a say in that, especially when it comes to deployment of these systems, which is when the rubber really hits the road, it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "And that's why I say, I think as a first step, it would be better if we have the choice to build these systems as tools to give, and I'm not saying that they should never go beyond tools because of course the potential is there for it to go way beyond just tools."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "But I think that would be a good first step in order for us to allow us to carefully experiment and understand what these things can do."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So the leap between tool, the sentient entity being is one we should take very careful of."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Let me ask a dark personal question."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So you're one of the most brilliant people in the AI community, you're also one of the most kind

topic again from scratch is a new field is very humbling, right?"}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So for me, that's been biology over the last five years, huge area topic and I just love doing that, but it helps to keep you grounded like it keeps you open minded."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "And then the other important thing is to have a really good, amazing set of people around you at your company or
