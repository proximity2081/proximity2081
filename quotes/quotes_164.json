[{"title": "Silvio Micali: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Algorand, Bitcoin & Ethereum | Lex Fridman Podcast #168", "id": "zNdhgOk4-fE", "quotes": [{"time": 287, "text": "So if instead of this common knowledge is a very powerful tool for humanity."}, {"time": 296, "text": "So we return to it from a bunch of different perspectives, including like a technical perspective."}, {"time": 300, "text": "But you often talk about blockchain and some of these concepts of decentralization, scalability, security, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 309, "text": "But one of the most maybe impactful, exciting things that leverage the blockchain, this kind of ledger idea of common knowledge is cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 325, "text": "So in the financial space."}, {"time": 325, "text": "So is there, can you say in the same kind of basic way, what is cryptocurrency in the context of this common knowledge and in the context of the blockchain?"}, {"time": 337, "text": "Cryptocurrency is a currency that is on such a ledger."}, {"time": 337, "text": "So imagine that on the ledger, initially, you know that somehow, say you and I are the only owner, each one, let's give it ourselves a billion each of whatever this unit."}, {"time": 352, "text": "Then I start writing on the ledger, I give 100 of these units to my sister, I give this much to my aunt."}, {"time": 361, "text": "And then now, because it's written on the ledger and everybody can see, my sister can give 57 of these units that she received from me to somebody else."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And that is money."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And that is money because you can see that somebody who tenders your payment has really the money there."}, {"time": 379, "text": "You don't have any more of a doubt when you want to sell an item."}, {"time": 386, "text": "If I write you a check, is the check covered?"}, {"time": 393, "text": "Or do I have the money at the moment of a transaction?"}, {"time": 393, "text": "You really see because the ledger is always updated."}, {"time": 398, "text": "What you see is what I see, what the merchant sees."}, {"time": 398, "text": "You know that the money, the money is the most powerful money system there is because it is totally transparent."}, {"time": 404, "text": "And so you know that you have been paid, and you know that the money is there, you have not to second guess anything else."}, {"time": 418, "text": "So the common knowledge applied there is you're basically mimicking the same kind of thing you would get in the physical space, which is if you give 100 bucks or 100 of that thing, whatever of that cryptocurrency to your sister, the actual transfer is as real as you giving like a basket of apples to your sister."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So in the case in the physical space, the common knowledge is in the physics of the atoms."}, {"time": 448, "text": "And then it's digital space, the common knowledge is in this ledger."}, {"time": 455, "text": "And so that transfer holds the same kind of power, but now it's operating in the digital space."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Again, I apologize for a set of ridiculous questions, but you mentioned cryptocurrencies and money."}, {"time": 472, "text": "What is money?"}, {"time": 472, "text": "Why do we have money?"}, {"time": 472, "text": "Do you think about this kind of from this high philosophical level at times of this tool, this idea that we humans have all kind of came up with and seem to be using effectively to do stuff?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "Money is a social construct, okay, in my opinion."}, {"time": 495, "text": "And this has been somehow people always felt that somehow money is a way to allow us to transact, even though we want different things."}, {"time": 502, "text": "So I have two sheep, and then you have one cow, and I want the cow, but you are looking for blankets instead, you know, so to have money is really simplifies this."}, {"time": 519, "text": "But at the end of it, that's why a bit was invented."}, {"time": 524, "text": "And you started with gold, you started with the coinage, then you started with the check."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But at the end of the day, money is essentially a social construct because you know that what you receive, you can actually spend with somebody else."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And so there is a kind of a social pact and social belief that you have."}, {"time": 541, "text": "At the end of the day, even barter requires these beliefs that other people are going to accept the quote unquote currency you offer them."}, {"time": 557, "text": "Because if I'm a mason, and you ask me to build a wall in your field, and I did, and you, in exchange, you give me a thousand sheep, what am I going to do?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "Eat them all?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "No, I have to feed them."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And if I don't feed them, they die, and my value is zero."}, {"time": 577, "text": "So in receiving this livestock, I must believe that somebody else will accept them in return for something else."}, {"time": 585, "text": "So money is a social belief, social shared belief system that makes people transact."}, {"time": 593, "text": "I didn't even think about that, that you're actually, you have a deep like network of beliefs about how society operates."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So the value is assigned even to sheep, based on that everyone will continue operating how they were previously operating."}, {"time": 612, "text": "Somebody will feed the sheep."}, {"time": 619, "text": "So that directly transfers to the space of money and then to the space of digital money, cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 626, "text": "Does it bother you sort of intellectually when this money that is a social construct is not directly tied to physical goods like gold, for example?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "Not at all, because after all, gold has some industrial value."}, {"time": 640, "text": "Nobody delights it."}, {"time": 640, "text": "It's a metal."}, {"time": 649, "text": "It doesn't oxidate."}, {"time": 649, "text": "It has some good things about it."}, {"time": 649, "text": "But does this industrial value really represent the value to which it now is traded?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "So gold is another way to express our belief."}, {"time": 661, "text": "I give you an ounce of gold, you treat it like, oh, somebody else will want this for doing something else."}, {"time": 667, "text": "So it is really this notion of this."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Money is a mental construct, is really, and is shared, is a social construct, I really believe."}, {"time": 674, "text": "And so some people feel that it's physical, so therefore gold exists."}, {"time": 681, "text": "Then, as you know now, countries, most sophisticated country right now, they print their own money and you believe that they are not going to exaggerate it with inflation."}, {"time": 695, "text": "Not everybody believes it, but at least they are not going to exaggerate it blatantly."}, {"time": 702, "text": "And therefore you receive it because you know that somebody else will accept it, will have faith in the currency and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 709, "text": "But whether it's gold, whether it's livestock, whatever it is, money is really a shared belief."}, {"time": 719, "text": "So there is something, you know, and I've been reading more and more about different cryptocurrencies."}, {"time": 727, "text": "There is a kind of belief that the scarcity of a particular resource like Bitcoin has a limited amount and it's tied to physical, you know, to proof of work."}, {"time": 734, "text": "So it's tied to physical reality in terms of how much you can mine effectively and so on."}, {"time": 743, "text": "That that's an important feature of money."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Do you think that's an important feature to be a part of whatever the money is?"}, {"time": 754, "text": "That is certainly a very useful part."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So at some point in time, you know, assume that money is something that all of a sudden we say, daisies are money, are the currency."}, {"time": 766, "text": "Then, you know, I offer you 10 daisies in payment of whatever goods and services you want to provide."}, {"time": 772, "text": "But at the end of the day, if you know that you can cultivate it and generate them at will, then perhaps, you know, you should not accept my payment."}, {"time": 779, "text": "Here is a bouquet of daisies."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So you need some kind of a scarcity."}, {"time": 788, "text": "The inability to create it suddenly out of nothing is unimportant."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And it's not an intrinsic necessity, but it's much easier to accept once you know that there is a fixed number of units of whatever currency there is and therefore you can mentally understand I'm getting, you know, this much of this piece of a pie and therefore I consider myself paid."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I understand what I'm receiving."}, {"time": 817, "text": "You described the goals of a blockchain."}, {"time": 823, "text": "You have a nice presentation on this as scalability, security, and decentralization."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And you challenged the blockchain trilemma that claims you can only have two of the three."}, {"time": 835, "text": "So let's talk about each."}, {"time": 835, "text": "What is scalability in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "What does scalability mean?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "So remember, we said that the blockchain is a ledger and each page receives a, gets some transaction and everybody can write in these pages of the ledger."}, {"time": 849, "text": "Nobody can be stopped from writing and everybody can read them."}, {"time": 856, "text": "Scalability means how fast can you write?"}, {"time": 861, "text": "Just imagine that you can write an entry in this special shared ledger once every hour."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Well, you know, what are you going to do if you have no one transaction of an hour, the world doesn't go around."}, {"time": 873, "text": "So you need to have scalability means here that you can then somehow write a lot of transaction and then you can read them and everybody can validate them."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And that is the speed and the number of transactions per second and the fact that they are shared."}, {"time": 894, "text": "So you want to have this speed not only in writing, but in sharing and in inspection for validity."}, {"time": 901, "text": "This is scalability."}, {"time": 901, "text": "The world is big."}, {"time": 901, "text": "The world wants to interact, the people want to interact with each other and you better be prepared to have a ledger in which you can write lots and lots and lots of transactions in this special way very, very, very quickly."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So maybe from a more mathematical perspective or can we say something about how much scalability is needed for a world that is big?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Well, it really depends how many transactions you want, but remember that I think right now yet to go into at least 1000s of transactions per second, even if you look at credit cards, we are going to go from an average of 1600 to peaks of 20,000 or 40,000, something like this."}, {"time": 954, "text": "But remember, it's not only a question of a transaction per se, but the value is that the transaction is actually being shared and visible to everybody and the certainty that that is the case."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I can print on my own printer way more transactions, but nobody has the time to see or to inspect."}, {"time": 975, "text": "That doesn't count."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So you want scalability at this common knowledge level."}, {"time": 982, "text": "I also meant from a perspective of like a complexity analysis."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So when you get more and more people involved, doesn't need to scale in some kind of way that do you like to see certain kind of properties in order to say something is scalable?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "I took a little bit implicitly that the people transacting are actually very different."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "So if there is a two people who can do thousands of transactions per second with each other, this is not so interesting."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "What do we really need is to say there are billions of people at any point in time, you know, thousands and thousands of them want to transact with each other and you want to support to that."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "So Algorand, it solves, so that's the company, the team of cryptographers and mathematicians, engineers, so on, that challenged the blockchain trilemma."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So let's break it down in terms of achieving scalability."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "How do we achieve scalability in the space of blockchain, in the space of cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So scalability, security, remember, and decentralization, right?"}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So that's what they want."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "What's the best way to approach?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Can we break it down?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Let's start with scalability and think about how do we achieve it?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Well, to achieve it one at a time is perhaps easy, even security."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "If nobody transacts, nobody loses money."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So that is secure, but it's not scalable."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So let me tell you, I'm a cryptographer, so I try to fight the bad guys."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And what you want is that the vesselager that we discussed before cannot be tampered with."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So you must think of it as a special link that nobody can erase."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Then it has to be, everybody should be able to read and not to alter the pages or the content of the pages."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "That is actually easy cryptographically."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Easy cryptographically means you can use tools invented 50 years ago, which in cryptographic time is prehistory, okay?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "We cavemen working around and solve the problem in cryptography land."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "But there is really a fundamental problem, which is really almost a social, seems a political problem, is to say, who the hell chooses or publishes the next page of the ledger?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "I mean, that is really the challenge."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "This ledger, you can always add a page because more and more transaction had to be written on there."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And somebody has to assemble this transaction, put them on a page and add the next page."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Who is the somebody who chooses the page and adds it on?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Who can be trusted to do it?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Assume it is me for what I'm being, not that I want to volunteer for the job, but then I would have more power than any absolute monarch in history, because I would have a tremendous power to say, these are the transactions that the entire world should see."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And whatever I don't write, this transaction will never see the light of day."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "I mean, no one had any such a power in history."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "So it's very important to do that."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And that is the quintessential problem in a blockchain."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And people have thought about it to say, it's not me, it's not you."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "But for instance, in proof of work, what people say is, okay, it's not me, it's not you, you know what it is?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "We make a very difficult, we invented a cryptographic puzzle, very hard to solve."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "The first one to solve it has the right to add one page to the ledger on behalf of everybody else."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "That now seems okay, because sometimes I solve a puzzle before you do, sometimes you solve before I do, or before somebody else solves it, it's okay."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And presumably, the effort you put in is somehow correlated with how much trust you should be given to add to the ledger."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Yeah, so somehow you want to make sure that you need to work because you want to prevent, you want to make sure that you get one solution every 10 minutes, say, like in a particular example of Bitcoin, so that it is very rare that two pages are added at the same time."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Because if I solve a puzzle at the same time you do, it could happen that if it happens once or twice, we can survive it."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "But if it happens every other page is a double page, then which of the two is the real page, it becomes a problem."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So that's why in Bitcoin, it is important to have a substantial amount of work so that no matter how many people try on Earth to solve a puzzle, you have one solution out of how many people are trying every 10 minutes."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So that you have, you distance these pages, and you have the time to propagate through the network a solution and the page attached to it."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And therefore, there is one page at a time that is added."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And you say, well, why don't we do it?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "We have a solution."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "Well, first of all, a page every 10 minutes is not fast enough."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "It's a question of scalability."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And second of all, to ensure that no matter how many people try, you get one page every 10 minutes, one solution to the riddle every 10 minutes."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "This means that the riddle becomes very, very hard."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And to have a chance to solve it within 10 minutes, you must have such an expensive apparatus in terms of specialized computers, not one, not two, but thousands and thousands of them."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And they produce tons of heat, okay?"}, {"time": 1335, "text": "They dissipate heat like maniac."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And then you have to refrigerate them too."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And so then now you have air conditioning galore to add to the thing."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "It becomes so expensive that fewer and fewer and fewer people can actually compete in order to add to the page."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And the problem becomes so crucial that in Bitcoin, depending on which day of the week you look at it, you are going to have two or three mining pools that are really the ones that are capable of controlling the chain."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So you're saying that's almost like at least a centralization."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "It started being decentralized, but the expenses became higher and higher and higher."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "When the cost becomes higher and higher, fewer and fewer people can afford them."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And then it becomes de facto centralized, right?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And a different type of approach is instead, for instance, a delegated proof of stake, which is also very easy to explain, essentially boils down to say, well, look at these 21 people, say, okay?"}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Don't they look honest?"}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Yes, they do."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "In fact, I believe that they're going to remain honest for the foreseeable future."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "So why don't we do ourselves a favor?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "Let's entrust them to add the page on behalf of all of us to the ledger."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "But now we are going to say, is this centralized or decentralized?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Well, 21 is better than one, but to say is very little."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So if you look at when people rebelled to centralize power, I don't know, the French revolutions, okay?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "There was a monarch and the nobles."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Were there 21 nobles?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "No, there were thousands of them, but there were millions and millions of disempowered citizens."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So one is centralized, 21 is also centralized, right?"}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So that's delegated proof of stake."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Delegated."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "It's kind of like representative democracy, I guess."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Yes, which is good."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "It's working great, right?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "It's working great."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Well, it's better than the single monarch, right?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "There's problems."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "There are problems."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And so we were looking for a different, when thinking about Algorand, for a different approach."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And so we have an approach that is really, really decentralized because essentially it works as follows."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "You have a bunch of tokens, right?"}, {"time": 1496, "text": "These are the tokens that have equal power."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And you have say 10 billions of tokens distributed to the entire world."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And the owners, each token has a chance to add the ledger, equal probability to everybody else."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "In fact, actually, if you want, here is how it works."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "So think about by some magic cryptographic process, which is not magic, it's mathematics, but think of it as magic."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Assume that you select a thousand tokens and so sometimes a random, okay?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And you have a guarantee that the random selected."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "And then the owners of these 1000 tokens somehow agree on the next page, they all sign it, and that is the next page."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So it is clear that nobody has the power but in a while, one of your tokens is selected and you are in charge of this committee to select the next page."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "But this goes around very quickly."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "So, and if you look at this, the equation really is that it's not really centralized."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "And because for agreeing on the same page, it is important that the 1000 tokens that you randomly selected are in honest ends, the majority of them."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So which, if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, that is essentially true because if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, if you select, say 90% of the people are, 90% of the tokens are in honest ends."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "So can you randomly select a thousand, in this thousand you find the 501 tokens in bad ends."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Very, very improbable."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "So basically, when a large fraction of people are honest, then you can use randomness as a powerful tool to get decentralization."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So what does honesty mean?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And now we're into the social side of things, which is how do we know that like the fraction, a large fraction of people or participating parties are honest?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "That is an excellent question."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So by the way, first of all, we should realize that the same thing is for every other system."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "When you look at proof of work, you rely that the majority of the mining power is in honest ends."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "When you look at delegated proof of stake, you rely that the majority of these 21 people are honest."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "What is the difference?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "The difference is that in these other systems, you should say the whole economy is secure if the majority of this small piece of economy are honest."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And that is a big question."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But instead, in Algorand, in our approach, we say the whole economy is secure if the majority of the economy is honest."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "In other words, who can subvert Algorand is not a majority of a small group, but is a majority of the token holders had to conspire with each other in order to sink the very economy for which they own the majority of."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "That I think it is a bit harder to... Like a self destructive majority, essentially."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And you're also making me realize that basically every system that we have in the world today assumes that the majority of participants is honest."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "The only difference is the majority of whom."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "And in some cases, the majority of a club and in our case is the majority of the whole system."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "The whole system."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So through that kind of random sampling, you can achieve decentralization."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "You can achieve..."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So the scalability, I understand."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And then the security that you're referring to, basically the security comes from the fact that the sample selected would likely include honest people."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "So it's very difficult to..."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "So by the way, the security, as you mentioned, you're referring to is basically security against dishonesty, right?"}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Or manipulation or whatever."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So essentially when what you're going to do is to the following and say, well, Silvio, I understood what you're saying, but somebody has to randomly randomly selected these tokens, then I believe you."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So then who does this random selection?"}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And in Algorand, we do something a little bit unorthodox."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "Essentially is the token choose themselves at random."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And you say, if you think about it, that seems to be a terrible idea."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Because if you want to say, choose yourself at random, and whoever chooses himself is a thousand people committee, you choose the page for the rest of us."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "And because if I'm a bad person, I'm going to select myself over and over again, because I want to be part of the committee every single time."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "But not so fast."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So what do we do in Algorand?"}, {"time": 1822, "text": "What does it mean that I select

few years later, actually, we proved a theorem which essentially says every theorem, no matter what about, can be explained in a zero knowledge way."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "So it's not a class of theorem, but all theorems."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "And it's a very powerful thing."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "So we were really, for thousands of years, bought this identity between knowledge and

want."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "That is really the best type of thing."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "And it is a very hard science and art to design these games."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And it challenges us to actually come up with solution concepts for a way to analyzing the games that need to be broader."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "And I think game theory has developed a bunch of very compelling ways to analyze the game, that if the game has the best property, you can have a pretty good guarantee that it's going to be played in a given way."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "But as it turns out, and not surprisingly, these tools have a range of action like anything else."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "All these so called the technical resolution concept, the way to analyze the game, like dominant strategy equilibrium, if something comes to mind, would be very meaningful."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "But as a limited power, in some sense, the games that can be admit to such a way to be analyzed."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "There's a very specific kind of games and the rules are set, the constraints are set, the utilities are all set."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "So if you want to reason, if there is a way, say, that you can analyze a restricted class of games this way, but most games don't fall into this restricted class, then what do I do?"}, {"time": 5486, "text": "When you need to enlarge a way what a rational player can do."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "So for instance, in my opinion, at least in some of my, I played with this for a few years, and I was doing some exoteric things, I'm sure, in the space that was not exactly mainstream."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And then I changed my interest in blockchain."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "But what I'm saying for a while I was doing."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "So for instance, to me, is a way in which I design the game, and you don't have the best move for you."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "The best move is the move that is best for you, no matter what the other players are doing."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "Sometimes a game doesn't have that, okay, it's too much to ask."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "But I can design the game such that given the option in front of you say, oh, these are really stupid for me, take them aside."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "But these, these are not stupid."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So if you design the game so that in any combination of non stupid things that the player can do, I achieve what I want, I'm done."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "I don't care to find the very unique equilibrium."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "I don't give a damn."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "I want to say, well, as long as you don't do stupid things, and nobody else does stupid things, good social things outcome arise, I should be equally happy."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And so I really believe that this type of analysis is possible and has a bigger radius."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "So it reaches more games, more classes or games."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And after that, we have to enlarge it again."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And it's going to be, we're going to have fun because

I learned from my venture in mechanism design is that incentives are very hard to design because people are very complex creatures."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "And so somehow the way we design Algorand is a totally different way, essentially with no incentives, essentially."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But technically speaking, there is a notion that is actually believable, right?"}, {"time": 5648,
