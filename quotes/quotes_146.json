will be able to find some form of communication, whatever communication means."}, {"time": 338, "text": "Communication requires notions of purpose and things like this."}, {"time": 343, "text": "It's a kind of philosophical quagmire."}, {"time": 346, "text": "So if AI is a kind of alien life form, what do you think visiting looks like?"}, {"time": 346, "text": "So if we look at aliens visiting, and we'll get to discuss computation and the world of computation, but if you were to imagine, you said you already prejudiced something by saying you visit, but how would aliens visit?"}, {"time": 369, "text": "By visit, there's kind of an implication."}, {"time": 369, "text": "And here we're using the imprecision of human language, you know, in a world of the future."}, {"time": 375, "text": "And if that's represented in computational language, we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation, basically, and find out exactly what does that mean, what properties does it have, and so on."}, {"time": 389, "text": "But by visit, in ordinary human language, I'm kind of taking it to be there's something, a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft, since we kind of know that that's necessary."}, {"time": 402, "text": "We're not imagining it's just, you know, photons showing up in a radio signal that, you know, photons in some very elaborate pattern, we're imagining it's physical things made of atoms and so on, that show up."}, {"time": 418, "text": "Can it be photons in a pattern?"}, {"time": 421, "text": "I mean, whether there is the possibility, you know, what counts as intelligence?"}, {"time": 425, "text": "I mean, it's, you know, and I used to think there was sort of a, oh, there'll be, you know, it'll be clear what it means to find extraterrestrial intelligence, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 435, "text": "I've increasingly realized, as a result of science that I've done, that there really isn't a bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational, so to speak."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So, you know, in our kind of everyday sort of discussion, we'll say things like, you know, the weather has a mind of its own."}, {"time": 453, "text": "Well, let's unpack that question."}, {"time": 453, "text": "You know, we realize that there are computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of this and that and the atmosphere, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 464, "text": "How do we distinguish that from the processes that go on in our brains of, you know, the physical processes that go on in our brains?"}, {"time": 473, "text": "How do we separate those?"}, {"time": 473, "text": "How do we say the physical processes going on that represent sophisticated computations in the weather, oh, that's not the same as the physical processes that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains?"}, {"time": 485, "text": "The answer is, I don't think there is a fundamental distinction."}, {"time": 489, "text": "I think the distinction for us is that there's kind of a thread of history and so on that connects kind of what happens in different brains to each other, so to speak."}, {"time": 501, "text": "And it's a, you know, what happens in the weather is something which is not connected by sort of a thread of civilizational history, so to speak, to what we're used to."}, {"time": 512, "text": "In the stories that the human brains told us, but maybe the weather has its own stories."}, {"time": 517, "text": "MG."}, {"time": 517, "text": "And that's where we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence because, you know, it's like that pulsar magnetosphere that's generating these very elaborate radio signals."}, {"time": 529, "text": "You know, is that something that we should think of as being this whole civilization that's developed over the last however long, you know, millions of years of processes going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what, you know, what we're used to in human intelligence?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "I mean, I think in the end, you know, when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it and the whole, you know, Fermi paradox of how come there's no other signs of intelligence in the universe, my guess is that we've got sort of two alien forms of intelligence that we're dealing with, artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial intelligence."}, {"time": 570, "text": "And my guess is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved around the same time."}, {"time": 575, "text": "And in other words, people will say, well, yes, we're used to computers, things we've created, digital things we've created, being sort of intelligent like we are."}, {"time": 587, "text": "And they'll say, oh, we're kind of also used to the idea that there are things around the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are, except they don't share the sort of civilizational history that we have."}, {"time": 597, "text": "And so they're a different branch."}, {"time": 597, "text": "I mean, it's similar to when you talk about life, for instance."}, {"time": 604, "text": "I mean, you kind of said life form, I think almost synonymously with intelligence, which I don't think is, you know, the AIs would be upset to hear you equate those two things."}, {"time": 618, "text": "Because I really probably implied biological life."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But you're saying, I mean, we'll explore this more, but you're saying it's really a spectrum and it's all just a kind of computation."}, {"time": 629, "text": "And so it's a full spectrum and we just make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kinds of computation."}, {"time": 637, "text": "I mean, the thing that I think I've kind of come to realize is, you know, at some level, it's a little depressing to realize that there's so little or liberating."}, {"time": 648, "text": "Well, yeah, but I mean, it's, you know, it's the story of science, right?"}, {"time": 652, "text": "And, you know, from Copernicus on, it's like, you know, first we were like, convinced our planets at the center of the universe."}, {"time": 656, "text": "No, that's not true."}, {"time": 656, "text": "Well, then we were convinced there's something very special about the chemistry that we have as biological organisms."}, {"time": 666, "text": "That's not really true."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And then we're still holding out that hope."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Oh, this intelligence thing we have, that's really special."}, {"time": 671, "text": "I don't think it is."}, {"time": 671, "text": "However, in a sense, as you say, it's kind of liberating for the following reason, that you realize that what's special is the details of us, not some abstract attribute that, you know, we could wonder, oh, is something else going to come along and, you know, also have that abstract attribute?"}, {"time": 691, "text": "Well, yes, every abstract attribute we have, something else has it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But the full details of our kind of history of our civilization and so on, nothing else has that."}, {"time": 702, "text": "That's what, you know, that's our story, so to speak."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And that's sort of almost by definition, special."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So I view it as not being such a, I mean, initially I was like, this is bad."}, {"time": 716, "text": "This is kind of, you know, how can we have self respect about the things that we do?"}, {"time": 722, "text": "Then I realized the details of the things we do, they are the story."}, {"time": 728, "text": "Everything else is kind of a blank canvas."}, {"time": 728, "text": "So maybe on a small tangent, you just made me think of it, but what do you make of the monoliths in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens communicating with us and sparking the kind of particular intelligent computation that we humans have?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Is there anything interesting to get from that sci fi?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think what's fun about that is, you know, the monoliths are these, you know, one to four to nine perfect cuboid things."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And in the Earth a million years ago, whatever they were portraying with a bunch of apes and so on, a thing that has that level of perfection seems out of place."}, {"time": 768, "text": "It seems very kind of constructed, very engineered."}, {"time": 775, "text": "What is the, you know, what's the techno signature, so to speak?"}, {"time": 782, "text": "What is it that you see it somewhere and you say, my gosh, that had to be engineered."}, {"time": 787, "text": "Now, the fact is we see crystals, which are also very perfect."}, {"time": 795, "text": "And, you know, the perfect ones are very perfect."}, {"time": 795, "text": "They're nice polyhedral or whatever."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And so in that sense, if you say, well, it's a sign of sort of it's a techno signature that it's a perfect polygonal shape, polyhedral shape."}, {"time": 807, "text": "That's not true."}, {"time": 807, "text": "And so then it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 814, "text": "What is the right signature?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "I mean, like, you know, Gauss, famous mathematician, you know, he had this idea, you should cut down the Siberian forest in the shape of sort of a typical image of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that it was a kind of cool idea, didn't get done."}, {"time": 831, "text": "But, you know, it's on the grounds that the Martians would see that and realize, gosh, there are mathematicians out there."}, {"time": 837, "text": "It's kind of, you know, in his theory of the world, that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species."}, {"time": 848, "text": "But, you know, it's a reasonable question."}, {"time": 848, "text": "What do you, what can you send or create that is a sign of intelligence in its creation or even intention in its creation?"}, {"time": 856, "text": "You talk about if we were to send a beacon."}, {"time": 862, "text": "Can you what should we send?"}, {"time": 862, "text": "Is math our greatest creation?"}, {"time": 862, "text": "Is what is our greatest creation?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "I think I think it's a it's a philosophically doomed issue."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I mean, in other words, you send something, you think it's fantastic, but it's kind of like we are part of the universe."}, {"time": 882, "text": "We make things that are, you know, things that happen in the universe."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Computation, which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstract sense using to create all these elaborate things we create, is surprisingly ubiquitous."}, {"time": 893, "text": "In other words, we might have thought that, you know, we've built this whole giant engineering stack that's led us to microprocessors, that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations."}, {"time": 906, "text": "But this idea that computations are happening all over the place."}, {"time": 913, "text": "The only question is whether whether there's a thread that connects our human intentions to what those computations are."}, {"time": 918, "text": "And so I think I think this question of what do you send to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible way?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "I think any kind of almost random slab of stuff we've produced is about equivalent to everything else."}, {"time": 932, "text": "I think it's one of these things where it's a non romantic way of phrasing it."}, {"time": 938, "text": "I just started to interrupt, but I just talked to Andrew in who's the wife of Carl Sagan."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And so I don't know if you're familiar with the Voyager."}, {"time": 951, "text": "I mean, she was part of sending, I think, brainwaves of, you know, wasn't it hers?"}, {"time": 957, "text": "Her brainwaves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan."}, {"time": 957, "text": "It's this beautiful story that perhaps you would shut down the power of that by saying we might as well send anything else."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And that's interesting."}, {"time": 971, "text": "All of it is kind of an interesting, peculiar thing."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Yeah, yeah, right."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Well, I mean, I think it's kind of interesting to see on the Voyager, you know, golden record thing."}, {"time": 981, "text": "One of the things that's kind of cute about that is, you know, it was made when was it in the late 70s, early 80s."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And, you know, one of the things, it's a phonograph record."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And, you know, it's kind of like it's shocking that in just 30 years, if you show that to a random kid of today, and you show them that diagram, I've tried this experiment, they're like, I don't know what the heck this is."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And the best anybody can think of is, you know, take the whole record, forget the fact that it has some kind of helical track in it, just image the whole thing and see what's there."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "That's what we would do today."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "In only 30 years, our technology has kind of advanced to the point where the playing of a helical, you know, mechanical track on a phonograph record is now something bizarre."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "So, you know, it's a cautionary tale, I would say, in terms of the ability to make something that in detail sort of leads by the nose, some, you know, the aliens or whatever, to do something."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "It's like, no, you know, best you can do, as I say, if we were doing this today, we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "We would just take some high resolution imaging system and get all the bits off it and say, oh, it's a big nuisance that they put in a helix, you know, in a spiral."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Let's just unravel the spiral and start from there."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Do you think, and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of AI, interpretability of computation, being able to communicate with various kinds of computations, do you think we'd be able to, if you put your alien hat on, figure out this record, how to play this record?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "MG. Well, it's a question of what one wants to do."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I mean, SL."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about the other party."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "MG. What does understanding mean?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "I mean, that's the issue."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "The issue is, it's like when people were trying to do natural language understanding for computers, right?"}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So people tried to do that for years."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "It wasn't clear what it meant."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "In other words, you take your piece of English or whatever, and you say, gosh, my computer has understood this."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Okay, that's nice."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "What can you do with that?"}, {"time": 1123, "text": "Well, so for example, when we built WolfMalpha, one of the things was it's doing question answering and so on, and it needs to do natural language understanding."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "The reason that I realized after the fact, the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well, and people hadn't before, the number one thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language understanding."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "We were trying to turn the natural language into this computational language that we could then do things with."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Now, similarly, when you imagine your alien, you say, okay, we're playing them the record."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Did they understand it?"}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Well, it depends what you mean."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "If there's a representation that they have, if it converts to some representation where we can say, oh yes, that's a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding, then all well and good."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "But actually, the only ones that I think we can say would represent understanding are ones that will then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Maybe you're trying to understand, quantify how technologically advanced this particular civilization is."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So are they a threat to us from a military perspective?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "That's probably the first kind of understanding they'll be interested in."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Gosh, that's so hard."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "That's like in the Arrival movie, that was one of the key questions is, why are you here, so to speak?"}, {"time": 1205, "text": "Are you going to hurt us?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "But even that, it's very unclear."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "It's like, are you going to hurt us?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "That comes back to a lot of interesting AI ethics questions, because we might make an AI that says, well, take autonomous cars, for instance."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Well, let's make sure you only drive at precisely the speed limit, because we want to make sure we don't hurt you, so to speak."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "But you say, but actually, that means I'm going to be really late for this thing, and that sort of hurts me in some way."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "So it's hard to know."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Even the definition of what it means to hurt someone is unclear."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on, that's something one has to address."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "There's always tradeoffs, and that's the annoying thing about ethics."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Yeah, well, right."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And I think ethics, like these other things we're talking about, is a deeply human thing."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "There's no abstract, let's write down the theorem that proves that this is ethically correct."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "That's a meaningless idea."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "You have to have a ground truth, so to speak, that's ultimately what humans want, and they don't all want the same thing."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "So that gives one all kinds of additional complexity in thinking about that."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "One convenient thing in terms of turning ethics into computation, you can ask the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the survival of the species."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "That's a good existential issue."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "But then when you say survival of the species, you might say, you might, for example, let's say, forget about technology, just hang out and be happy, live our lives, go on to the next generation, go through many, many generations where, in a sense, nothing is happening."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Is that okay?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Is that not okay?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Hard to know."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "In terms of the attempt to do elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of the species."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "It's also a little bit hard to know, so okay, let's take that as a sort of thought experiment."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "You can say, well, what are the threats that we might have to survive?"}, {"time": 1343, "text": "The super volcano, the asteroid impact, all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "Okay, so now we inventory these possible threats and we say, let's make our species as robust as possible relative to all these threats."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "I think in the end, it's sort of an unknowable thing what it takes."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "So given that you've got this AI and you've told it, maximize the long term."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "What does long term mean?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Does long term mean until the sun burns out?"}, {"time": 1378, "text": "That's not going to work."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Does long term mean next thousand years?"}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Okay, they're probably optimizations for the next thousand years."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "It's like if you're running a company, you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "Like if your company gets bought by some private investment group, then you can run a company just fine for five years by just taking what it does and removing all R&D and the company will burn out after a while, but it'll run just fine for a little while."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "So if you tell the AI, keep the humans okay for a thousand years, there's probably a certain set of things that one would do to optimize that, many of which one might say, well, that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history, so to speak, for that to be what happens."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "But I think in the end, as you start thinking about that question, what you realize is there's a whole sort of raft of undecidability, computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "In other words, one of the good things about what our civilization has gone through and what we humans go through is that there's a certain computational irreducibility to it in the sense that it isn't the case that you can look from the outside and just say, the answer is going to be this."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "At the end of the day, this is what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "You actually have to go through the process to find out."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And I think that feels better in the sense that something is achieved by going through all of this process."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "But it also means that telling the AI, go figure out what will be the best outcome."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "Well, unfortunately, it's going to come back and say, it's kind of undecidable what to do."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "We'd have to run all of those scenarios to see what happens."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And if we want it for the infinite future, we're thrown immediately into sort of standard issues of kind of infinite computation and so on."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So yeah, even if you get that the answer to the universe and everything is 42, you still have to actually run the universe."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Yes, to figure out the question, I guess, or the journey is the point."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Well, I think it's saying to summarize, this is the result of the universe."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "If that is possible, it tells us, I mean, the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation and so on and thinking about how stuff works."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "If it's possible to say, and the answer is such and such, you're basically saying there's a way of going outside the universe."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And you're getting yourself into something of a sort of paradox because you're saying, if it's knowable what the answer is, then there's a way to know it that is beyond what the universe provides."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "But if we can know it, then something that we're dealing with is beyond the universe."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So then the universe isn't the universe, so to speak."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And in general, as we'll talk about, at least for our small human brains, it's hard to show the result of a sufficiently complex computation."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "I mean, it's probably impossible, right, on this side ability."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And the universe appears by at least the poets to be sufficiently complex."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "They won't be able to predict what the heck it's all going to."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Well, we better not be able to, because if we can, it kind of denies."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "I mean, it's you know, we're part of the universe."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So what does it mean for us to predict?"}, {"time": 1596, "text": "It means that we that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the whole universe."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "And this this quickly winds up."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "I mean, that it is conceivable."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "The only way we'd be able to predict is if we are so special in the universe, we are the one place where there is computation more special, more sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "That's the only way we would have the ability to sort of the almost theological ability, so to speak, to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we're better than everything else in the universe, which I don't think is the case."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "Yeah, perhaps we can detect a large number of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe them."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "And therefore, but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns interact and what kind of well, look, the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it's has regularity at all."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "Might not be the case."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "If you just have regularity, do you?"}, {"time": 1663, "text": "That fits full of I mean, physics is successful."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "You know, it's full of of laws that tell us a lot of detail about how the universe works."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "I mean, it could be the case that, you know, the 10 to the 90th particles in the universe, they will do their own thing, but they don't."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "They all follow."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "We already know they all follow basically physical, the same physical laws."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And that's something that's a very profound fact about the universe."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "What conclusion you draw from that is unclear."},

different conclusions about it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "But the fact is, you know, right now, I mean, I happen to be interested, actually, I've just restarted a long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "I'm kind of like, come on, I'm on a bit of a quest, which I'm about to make more public, to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory of physics."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "We'll come to that."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And I just had a lot of conversations with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm really excited on your take, because I think you have a fascinating take on the the fundamental nature of our reality from a physics perspective."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Okay, let's take a step back."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "What is computation?"}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Operationally, computation is following rules."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "That's kind of it."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "I mean, computation is the result is the process of systematically following rules."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And it is the thing that happens when you do that."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So taking initial conditions are taking inputs and following rules."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "I mean, what are you following rules on?"}, {"time": 1766, "text": "So there has to be some data, some unnecessarily, it can be something where there's a, you know, very simple input."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And then you're following these rules."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "And you'd say there's not really much data going into this."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "It's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule, if you want to."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So I think the question is, is there a robust notion of computation?"}, {"time": 1791, "text": "That is, what does robust mean?"}, {"time": 1795, "text": "What I mean by that is something like this."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So So one of the things in a different in another physics, something like energy, okay, the different forms of energy, there's, but somehow energy is a robust concept that doesn't, isn't particular to kinetic energy, or, you know, nuclear energy, or whatever else, there's a robust idea of energy."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So one of the things you might ask is, is the robust idea of computation?"}, {"time": 1819, "text": "Or does it matter that this computation is running in a Turing machine?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "This computation is running in a, you know, CMOS, silicon, CPU, this computation is running in a fluid system in the weather, those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it's running in?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And is there?"}, {"time": 1843, "text": "I mean, it wasn't obvious that there was."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So it's worth understanding the history and how we got to where we are right now."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Because, you know, to say that there is, is a statement in part about our universe."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's about what actually can exist for us."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "Maybe you can also comment because energy, as a concept is robust."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "But there's also its intricate, complicated relationship with matter, with mass, is very interesting, of particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carry force and particles that have mass."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "These kinds of ideas, they seem to map to each other, at least in the mathematical sense."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Is there a connection between energy and mass and computation?"}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Or are these completely disjoint ideas?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "We don't know yet."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "The things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics may well lead to such a connection, but there is no known connection at this time."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So can you elaborate a little bit more on what, how do you think about computation?"}, {"time": 1920, "text": "So I mean, let's, let's tell a little bit of a historical story."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So, you know, back, go back 150 years, people were making mechanical calculators of various kinds."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And, you know, the typical thing was you want an adding machine, you go to the adding machine store, basically, you want a multiplying machine, you go to the multiplying machine store, they're different pieces of hardware."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And so that means that, at least at the level of that kind of computation, and those kinds of pieces of hardware, there isn't a robust notion of computation, there's the adding machine kind of computation, there's the multiplying machine notion of computation, and they're disjoint."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So what happened in around 1900, people started imagining, particularly in the context of mathematical logic, could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function, right?"}, {"time": 1966, "text": "And they came up with things, this idea of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "And it didn't work."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "There were reasonable functions that people could come up with that were not represented using the primitives of primitive recursion."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Okay, so then, then along comes 1931, and Godel's theorem, and so on."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "And as in looking back, one can see that as part of the process of establishing Godel's theorem, Godel basically showed how you could compile arithmetic, how you could basically compile logical statements like this statement is unprovable into arithmetic."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "So what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense that's capable of representing all kinds of other things."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "And then Turing came along 1936, came up with Turing machines."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had come up with lambda calculus."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea of what computation might be."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And so, and then there started to be other ideas, you know, register machines, other kinds of other kinds of representations of computation."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And the big surprise was, they all turned out to be equivalent."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So in other words, it might have been the case, like those old adding machines and multiplying machines, that, you know, Turing had his idea of computation, Church had his idea of computation, and they were just different."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But it isn't true."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "They're actually all equivalent."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So then by, I would say the 1970s or so in sort of the computation, computer science, computation theory area, people had sort of said, oh, Turing machines are kind of what computation is."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "Physicists were still holding out saying, no, no, no, that's just not how the universe works."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "We've got all these differential equations."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "We've got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "The universe is not a Turing machine."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "The, you know, the Turing machines are a small subset of the things that we make in microprocessors and engineering structures and so on."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "So probably actually through my work in the 1980s about sort of the relationship between computation and models of physics, it became a little less clear that there would be, that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can happen in physics and what happens in things like Turing machines."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "And I think probably by now people would mostly think, and by the way, brains were another kind of element of this."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And Turing wasn't sure either."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "But although he was a little bit, he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "But I would say by probably sometime in the 1980s, there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that yes, this notion of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "Now, the next question is, okay, you can have a universal Turing machine that's capable of being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And, you know, this idea of universal computation, it's an important idea, this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and program it with different pieces of software."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "You know, that's kind of the idea that launched most modern technology."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "I mean, that's kind of, that's the idea that launched computer revolution software, etc."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So important idea."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "But the thing that's still kind of holding out from that idea is, okay, there is this universal computation thing, but seems hard to get to."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "It seems like you want to make a universal computer, you have to kind of have a microprocessor with, you know, a million gates in it, and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that level of computational sophistication."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "Okay, so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered in the early 80s, looking at these things called cellular automata, which are really simple computational systems, the thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were very, very simple, they were doing things that were as sophisticated as they did when their rules were much more complicated."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So it didn't look like, you know, this idea, oh, to get sophisticated computation, you have to build something with very sophisticated rules."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "That idea didn't seem to pan out."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "And instead, it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous, even in systems with incredibly simple rules."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And so that led to this thing that I call the principle of computational equivalence, which basically says, when you have a system that follows rules of any kind, then whenever the system isn't doing things that are, in some sense, obviously simple, then the computation that the behavior of the system corresponds to is of equivalence sophistication."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So that means that when you kind of go from the very, very, very simplest things you can imagine, then quite quickly, you hit this kind of threshold above which everything is equivalent in its computational sophistication."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Not obvious that would be the case."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "I mean, that's a science fact."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Well, no, hold on a second."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "So this you've opened with a new kind of science."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "I mean, I remember it was a huge eye opener that such simple things can create such complexity."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And yes, there's an equivalence, but it's not a fact."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "It just appears to, I mean, it's as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things are."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "But let me ask sort of, you just brought up previously, kind of like the communities of computer scientists with their Turing machines, the physicists with their universe, and whoever the heck, maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain."},

see those things basically blending together?"}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Or is there still a mystery about how disjoint they are?"}, {"time": 2361, "text": "Well, my guess is that they all blend together, but we don't know that for sure yet."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "I mean, this, you know, I should say, I said rather glibly that the principle of computational equivalence is sort of a science fact."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And I was using air quotes for the science fact, because when you, it is a, I mean, just to talk about that for a second."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "The thing is that it has a complicated epistemological character, similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "What is the second law of thermodynamics?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Is it a law of nature?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Is it a thing that is true of the physical world?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Is it something which is mathematically provable?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Is it something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world?"}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Is it, in some sense, a definition of heat, perhaps?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Well, it's a combination of those things."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And it's the same thing with the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "And in some sense, the principle of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation, because it's telling you there is a thing, there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems and doesn't depend on the details of each individual system."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And that's why we can meaningfully talk about a thing called computation."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And we're not stuck talking about, oh, there's computation in Turing machine number 3785, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "That's why there is a robust notion like that."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "Now, on the other hand, can we prove the principle of computational equivalence?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Can we prove it as a mathematical result?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Well, the answer is, actually, we've got some nice results along those lines that say, throw me a random system with very simple rules."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "Well, in a couple of cases, we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "Just to link on that point, the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "But is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex?"}, {"time": 2495, "text": "That you've mentioned that you cross a threshold."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So there are various indicators."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So, for example, one thing would be, is it capable of universal computation?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "That is, given the system, do there exist initial conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you want, to compute primes, to compute pi, to do whatever you want?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So that's an indicator."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "So we know in a couple of examples that, yes, the simplest candidates that could conceivably have that property do have that property."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And that's what the principle of computational equivalence might suggest."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "But this principle of computational equivalence, one question about it is, is it true for the physical world?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "It might be true for all these things we come up with, the Turing machines, the cellular automata, whatever else."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Is it true for our actual physical world?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Is it true for the brains, which are an element of the physical world?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "We don't know for sure."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "And that's not the type of question that we will have a definitive answer to, because there's a sort of scientific induction issue."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "You can say, well, it's true for all these brains, but this person over here is really special, and it's not true for them."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And the only way that that cannot be what happens is if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics, and it turns out to correspond to, let's say, a simple program."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "If that is the case, then we will basically have reduced physics to a branch of mathematics, in the sense that we will not be, you know, right now with physics, we're like, well, this is the theory that, you know, this is the rules that apply here."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "But in the middle of that, you know, right by that black hole, maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel back."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "But if we can get to the point where we actually have, this is the fundamental theory of physics, here it is, it's this program, run this program, and you will get our universe, then we've kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some, what turns out to be very difficult, irreducibly difficult, mathematical problems."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "But it no longer is the case that we can say that somebody can come in and say, whoops, you know, you will write about all these things about Turing machines, but you're wrong about the physical universe, we know there's sort of ground truth about what's happening in the physical universe."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Now, I happen to think, I mean, you asked me at an interesting time, because I'm just in the middle of starting to to re energize my, my project to kind of study fundamental theory of physics."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "As of today, I'm very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's going to be possible to to see that the universe really is computational in that sense."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "But I don't know, because we're betting against, you know, we're betting against the universe, so to speak."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And I didn't, you know, it's not like, you know, when I spend a lot of my life building technology, and then I know what what's in there, right?"},

universe."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "I'm not in that position, so to speak."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "What kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from?"},

this very clean structures, it's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules can create immense complexity."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "But what kind, you know, is that actually, are cellular automata sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics?"}, {"time": 2732, "text": "Just to give, can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create?"}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Well, so this is a slightly complicated issue, because as soon as you have universal computation, you can, in principle, simulate anything with anything."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "But it is not a natural thing to do."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And if you're asking, were you to try to find our physical universe by looking at possible programs

other words, if you say a cellular automaton, it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid, and it's very, you know, and every cell is updated in synchrony at a particular, you know, when there's a click of a clock, so to speak, and it goes a tick of a clock, and every cell gets updated at the same time."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "That's a very specific very rigid kind of thing."},

what we see, what emerges for us as physical space, for example, comes from something that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "And so I've been for a long time interested in kind of what are the most structuralist structures that we can set up."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "And actually, what I had thought about for ages is using graphs, networks, where essentially, so let's talk about space, for example."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So what is space?"}, {"time": 2836, "text": "It's a kind of a question one might ask."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "Back in the early days of quantum mechanics, for example, people said, oh, for sure, space is going to be discrete, because all these other things we're finding are discrete."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "But that never worked out in physics."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And so space in physics today is always treated as this continuous thing, just like Euclid imagined it."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "I mean, the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is, you know, a point is something which has no part."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "In other words, there are points that are arbitrarily small, and there's a continuum of possible positions of points."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "And the question is, is that true?"}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And so for example, if we look at, I don't know, fluid like air or water, we might say, oh, it's a continuous fluid."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But

computational?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "So there are a couple of possibilities."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "It could be computational, somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine, or it could be fundamentally not."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So how could it not be?"}, {"time": 2917, "text": "It could not be, so a Turing machine essentially deals with integers, whole numbers, at some level."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And you know, it can do things like it can add one to a number, it can do things like this."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "And it can also store whatever the heck it did."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "Yes, it has an infinite storage."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "But when one thinks about doing physics, or sort of idealized physics, or idealized mathematics, one can

these laws can emerge?"}, {"time": 3121, "text": "Like, do you think that's a good question?"}, {"time": 3124, "text": "Well, here's what I think."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle of this right now."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I'm telling you that I think this, yeah, I mean, this human has a hard time understanding, you know, a bunch of the things that are going on."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "But what happens in understanding is one builds waypoints."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "I mean, if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics, starting from, you know, counting back in, you know, whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago, whatever it was, right, that would be really difficult."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "But what happens is we build waypoints that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And we see the same thing happening in language."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "You know, when we invent a word for something, it provides kind of a cognitive anchor, a kind of a waypoint that lets us, you know, like a podcast or something."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "You could be explaining, well, it's a thing which works this way, that way, the other way."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "But as soon as you have the word podcast and people kind of societally understand it, you start to be able to build on top of that."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And so I think that's kind of the story of science actually, too."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "I mean, science is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for understanding something, then we can build on top of it."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "You know, we have the idea of, I don't know, differential equations we can build on top of that."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "We have this idea, that idea."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "So my hope is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer, and there's no waypoints in between, then we're toast."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "We won't be able to do that."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "Well, eventually we might."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So if we're as clever apes are good enough at building those abstract abstractions, eventually from sand we'll get to the computer, right?"}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And it just might be a longer journey."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "The question is whether it is something that you asked, whether our human brains will quote, understand what's going on."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And that's a different question because for that, it requires steps from which we can construct a human understandable narrative."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And that's something that I think I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "Although, you know, as of literally today, if you ask me, I'm confronted with things that I don't understand very well."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rules under which the computation functions."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "And it's an interesting possibility under which kinds of computations such a creature can understand itself."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "My guess is that within, so we didn't talk much about computational irreducibility, but it's a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "And it's sort of a core idea that one has to understand, I think, which is question is, you're doing a computation, you can figure out what happens in the computation just by running every step in the computation and seeing what happens."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out, you know, have something smarter that figures out what's going to happen before it actually happens."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "And a lot of traditional science has been about that act of computational reducibility."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "It's like, we've got these equations, and we can just solve them, and we can figure out what's going to happen."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "We don't have to trace all of those steps, we just jump ahead because we solve these equations."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you don't always get to do that."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible, in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow each step and see what happens."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "Well, if you're saying, well, we, with our brains, we're a lot smarter, we don't have to mess around like the little cellular automaton going through and updating all those cells."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "But if the principle of computational equivalence is right, that's not going to be correct, because it means that there's us doing our computation in our brains, there's a little cellular automaton doing its computation, and the principle of computational equivalence says these two computations are fundamentally equivalent."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "So that means we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than the cellular automaton and jump ahead, because we're just doing computation that's of the same sophistication as the cellular automaton itself."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "That's computational reducibility."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And that's a really powerful idea."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on, that we're all, we and the cellular automaton are the same."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "But the question we're talking about, the fundamental laws of physics, is kind of the reverse question."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "You're not predicting what's going to happen."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "You have to run the universe for that."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?"}, {"time": 3398, "text": "But the problem is, to know whether you're right, you have to have some computational reducibility, because we are embedded in the universe."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "If the only way to know whether we get the universe is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that, because it just ran for 14.6 billion years or whatever."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And we can't rerun it, so to speak."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "So we have to hope that there are pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say, yes, I can recognize those are electrons there."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "And I think that it's a feature of computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "It's sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "The question of whether they land in the right place and whether we can sort of build a theory based on them is unclear."}, {"time": 3440, "text": "But to this point about whether we as observers in the universe built out of the same stuff as the universe can figure out the universe, so to speak, that relies on these pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "Without the pockets of reducibility, it won't work, can't work."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "But I think this question about how observers operate, it's one of the features of science over the last 100 years particularly, has been that every time we get more realistic about observers, we learn a bit more about science."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "So for example, relativity was all about observers don't get to say what's simultaneous with what."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide what's simultaneous."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Or for example, in thermodynamics, observers don't get to say the position of every single molecule in a gas."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "They can only see the kind of large scale features, and that's why the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase, and so on works."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "If you could see every individual molecule, you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "You would conclude, oh, these molecules are just all doing these particular things."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "You wouldn't be able to see this aggregate fact."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "So I strongly expect that, and in fact, in the theories that I have, that one has to be more realistic about the computation and other aspects of observers in order to actually make a correspondence between what we experience."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "In fact, my little team and I have a little theory right now about how quantum mechanics may work, which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how the sort of thread of human consciousness relates to what we observe in the universe."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "But there's several steps to explain what that's about."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "What do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanics, sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics kind of says that there's some, there's two worlds."},

into this."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "I don't know yet."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "I think it's a mess."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "The fact is, one of the things that's interesting, and when people look at these models that I started talking about 30 years ago now, they say, oh no, that can't possibly be right."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "What about quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 3594, "text": "You say, okay, tell me what is the essence of quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 3594, "text": "What do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I've got quantum mechanics, so to speak?"},

3617, "text": "And they're like, well, maybe you shouldn't do that yet."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "We're not quite ready yet."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "And one of the questions that I've been curious about is, if I have five minutes with a quantum computer, how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer or whether it's a simulator at the other end?"}, {"time": 3631, "text": "And it turns out it's really hard."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "It's like a lot of these questions about what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "What's life?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "It's like, are you really a quantum computer?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Is it just a simulation or is it really a quantum computer?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Same issue all over again."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "So this whole issue about the sort of mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and the completely separate thing that is our experience in which we think definite things happen, whereas quantum mechanics doesn't say definite things ever happen."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes for different things to happen, but yet our thread of consciousness operates as if definite things are happening."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "Dilinga, on the point, you've kind of mentioned the structure that could underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something like a structure of a graph."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "Can you elaborate why your intuition is that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges and what it might represent?"}, {"time": 3699, "text": "So the question is, what is, in a sense, the most structuralist structure you can imagine, right?"}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And in fact, what I've recently realized in the last year or so, I have a new most structuralist structure."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "By the way, the question itself is a beautiful one and a powerful one in itself."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So even without an answer, just the question is a really strong question."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "But what's your new idea?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "Well, it has to do with hypergraphs."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "Essentially, what is interesting about the sort of model I have now is it's a little bit like what happened with computation."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "Everything that I think of as, oh, well, maybe the model is this, I discover it's equivalent."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "And that's quite encouraging because it's like I could say, well, I'm going to look at trivalent graphs with three edges for each node and so on, or I could look at this special kind of graph, or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "And turns out that the things I'm now looking at, everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Well, a typical way to think about it is, well, so you might have some collection of tuples, collection of, let's say, numbers."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four, just collections of numbers, triples of numbers, let's say, quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And you have all these sort of floating little tuples."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "They're not in any particular order."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "And that sort of floating collection of tuples, and I told you this was abstract, represents the whole universe."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "The only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same, it's the same, so to speak."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol, let's say at the same position of the tuple, at the first element of the tuple, then that represents a relation."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "So let me try and peel this back."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "I told you it's abstract, but this is the..."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "So the relationship is formed by some aspect of sameness."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "But so think about it in terms of a graph."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "So a graph, a bunch of nodes, let's say you number each node, then what is a graph?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "A graph is a set of pairs that say this node has an edge connecting it to this other node."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "And a graph is just a collection of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "So this is a generalization of that, in which instead of having pairs, you have arbitrary n tuples."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "That's the whole story."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "And now the question is, okay, so that might represent the state of the universe."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "How does the universe evolve?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "What does the universe do?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "And so the answer is that what I'm looking at is a transformation rules on these hypergraphs."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "In other words, you say this, whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph that looks like this, turn it into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "So on a graph, it might be when you see the subgraph, when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out in this particular way, then rewrite it as this other graph."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "And so that's the whole story."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "So the question is what, uh, so now you say, I mean, as I say, this is quite abstract."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And one of the questions is, uh, where do you do those updating?"}, {"time": 3927, "text": "So you've got this giant graph."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "What triggers the updating, like what's the, what's the ripple effect of it?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Is it, uh, and I suspect everything's discreet even in time."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So the question is where do you do the updates?"}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they apply."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "And you do them, you do them."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "The order in which the updates is done is not defined."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "That is the, you can do them."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "So there may be many possible orderings for these updates."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Now, the point is if imagine you're an observer in this universe."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So, and you say, did something get updated?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Well, you don't in any sense know until you yourself have been updated."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affects an event that's in you."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "That doesn't even feel like observation."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "That's like, that's something else."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "You're just part of the whole thing."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "Yes, you're part of it."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "But, but even to have, so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to is this causal network of what event affects what other event."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "I'm not making a big statement about sort of the structure of the observer."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument that what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites is not something that any observer, any conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Because the only thing the observer can be affected by is this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected by other events that happen in the universe."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "So the only thing you have to look at is the causal network."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "You don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting that's happening."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "So these rewrites are happening wherever they, they happen wherever they feel like."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Causal network."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Is there, you said that there's not really, so the idea would be an undefined, like what gets updated?"}, {"time": 4046, "text": "The, the sequence of things is undefined."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "It's a, yes."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "That's what you mean by the causal network, but then the call, no, the causal network is given that an update has happened."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "That's an event."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "Then the question is, is that event causally related to, does that event, if that event didn't happen, then some future event couldn't happen yet."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "And so you build up this network of what affects what."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "And so what that does, so when you build up that network, that's kind of the observable aspect of the universe in some sense."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "And so then you can ask questions about, you know, how robust is that observable network of the, what's happening in the universe."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "So here's where it starts getting kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules, the order of rewrites does not matter to the causal network."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "This is equivalent to the Church Rosser property or the confluence property of rewrite rules."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And it's the same reason that if you're simplifying an algebraic expression, for example, you can say, oh, let me expand those terms out."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Let me factor those pieces."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Doesn't matter what order you do that in, you'll always get the same answer."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon that causes for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules that causes the causal network to be independent of the microscopic order of rewritings."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "Why is that property important?"}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Because it implies special relativity."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "I mean, the reason it's important is that that property, special relativity says you can look at these sort of, you can look at different reference frames."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "You can have different, you can be looking at your notion of what space and what's time can be different depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed, depending on whether you're doing this, that, and the other."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the same."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "That's what the principle of special relativity says, is the laws of physics are the same independent of your reference frame."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Well, turns out this sort of change of the microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame, or at least there's a sub part of how that works that's equivalent to change a reference frame."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time in forever, it's possible for an underlying microscopic theory to imply special relativity, to be able to derive it."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "It's not something you put in as a, this is a, it's something where this other property, causal invariance, which is also the property that implies that there's a single thread of time in the universe."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "It might not be the case that that's what would lead to the possibility of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "Otherwise, you've got all these possible rewriting orders, and who's to say which one occurred."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "But with this causal invariance property, there's a notion of a definite thread of time."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "It sounds like that kind of idea of time, even space, would be emergent from the system."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "No, I mean, it's not a fundamental part of the system."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "No, no, it's a fundamental level."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "All you've got is a bunch of nodes connected by hyper edges or whatever."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "So there's no time, there's no space."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "And but the thing is that it's just like imagining, imagine you're just dealing with a graph."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "And imagine you have something like a, you know, like a honeycomb graph, or you have a hexagon, a bunch of hexagons."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "You know, that graph at a microscopic level, it's just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "But at a macroscopic level, you say that looks like a honeycomb, you know, lattice, it looks like a two dimensional, you know, manifold of some kind, it looks like a two dimensional thing."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "If you connect it differently, if you just connect all the nodes one, one to another, and kind of a sort of linked list type structure, then you'd say, well, that looks like a one dimensional space."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "But at the microscopic level, all these are just networks with nodes, the macroscopic level, they look like something that's like one of our sort of familiar kinds of space."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "And it's the same thing with these hyper graphs."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "Now, if you ask me, have I found one that gives me three dimensional space?"}, {"time": 4287, "text": "The answer is not yet."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So we don't know."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "This is one of these things we're kind of betting against nature, so to speak."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "And I have no way to know."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And so there are many other properties of this kind of system that are very beautiful, actually, and very suggestive."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right, because it's very clean."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "I mean, you start with nothing."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And everything gets built up, everything about space, everything about time, everything about matter."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "It's all just emergent from the properties of this extremely low level system."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "And that, that will be pretty cool if that's the way our universe works."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "Now, do I on the other hand, the thing that that I find very confusing is, let's say we succeed, let's say we can say this particular sort of hypergraph rewriting rule gives the universe just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times, and you'll get everything, you'll get this conversation we're having, you'll get everything."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "It's that if we get to that point, and we look at what is this thing, what is this rule that we just have, that is giving us our whole universe, how do we think about that thing?"}, {"time": 4359,

language code."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "So that's, which I wasn't sure was going to happen that way, but it's, it's a, that's, it's kind of, no, we don't know what, we don't know what that's, that's just the framework to know the actual particular hypergraph that might be a longer, the specification of the rules might be slightly longer."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "How does that help you accept

could tell why it worked."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "Because actually, the reason it worked was because he'd done all these calculations, and he knew that it was would work."}, {"time": 5545, "text":

have an intuition about an irreducible."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "I mean, you have to run it."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "MG Yes, that's right."}, {"time": 5738, "text": "TK That's so hard for us

5750, "text": "No, he was, I mean, I think he was sort of on the edge of understanding that point about computation."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "And I think he found that, I think he always found computation interesting."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "And I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "I mean, that intuition, you know, the difficulty of discovering things, like even you say, Oh, you know, you just enumerate all the cases and just find one that does something interesting, right?"}, {"time": 5772, "text": "Sounds very easy."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it, because I had kind of an intuition that said it shouldn't be there."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "So I had kind of arguments, Oh, I'm going to ignore that case, because whatever."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And how did you have an open mind enough?"}, {"time": 5786, "text": "Because you're essentially the same person as you should find, like the same kind of physics type of thinking."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "How did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity?"}, {"time": 5804, "text": "MG Yeah, I think that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I've wondered about that myself, because it's kind of like, you know, you live through these things, and then you say, what was the historical story?"}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact was not what you lived through, so to speak."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "And so, you know, what I realized is, I think what happened is, you know, I did physics, kind of like reductionistic physics, where you're thrown in the universe, and you're told, go figure out what's going on inside it."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "And then I started building computer tools."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And I started building my first computer language, for example."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And computer language is not like, it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations people want to do, and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "But then you do something that's really different, because you're just saying, okay, these are the primitives."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "Now, you know, hopefully they'll be useful to people, let's build up from there."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "So you're essentially building an artificial universe, in a sense, where you make this language, you've got these primitives, you're just building whatever you feel like building."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And so it was sort of interesting for me, because from doing science, where you're just thrown in the universe as the universe is, to then just being told, you know, you can make up any universe you want."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "And so I think that experience of making a computer language, which is essentially building your own universe, so to speak, that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "It's like, let's just explore what can be done in these artificial universes, rather than thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Yeah, by being able to program, essentially, you've, as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen, you now have, you've basically built another brain that you can use to explore the universe by computer program, you know, this is kind of a brain, right?"}, {"time": 5920, "text": "And it's well, it's it's or telescope, or you know,

romanticize the notion, but it's more general, the computer is more general."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "And it's, it's, I think, I mean, this point about, you know, people say, oh, such and such a

what's going on."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "That's really hard."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "And, you know, I think, in I've been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building computational language."}, {"time": 5964, "text": "And that's an activity that, in a sense, works by sort of having to kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "But, you know, it's, it's always I mean, I'm fully aware of, I suppose, the fact that I have seen it a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the

6008, "text": "In fact, somebody said that Newton didn't have an ego, and I looked into it and he had a huge ego."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "Yeah, but from an outsider's perspective, some have said

in a tech company."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "And, you know, that is a, I think it's actually very, it means that one's ego is not a distant thing."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "It's a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak, because it's, it's all tied up with leadership and with how one, you know, develops an organization and all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "So, you know, it may be that if I'd been an academic, for example, I could have sort of, you know, check the ego, put it on, put on a shelf somewhere and ignore its characteristics, but you're reminded of it

intimately tied to ego."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "Now, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 6082, "text": "I mean, what, what is the, you know, for me, I've been fortunate that I think I have reasonable intellectual confidence, so to speak."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "That is, you know, I, I'm one of these people who at this point, if somebody tells me something and I just don't understand it, my conclusion isn't that means I'm dumb."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "That my conclusion is there's something wrong with what I'm being told."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And that was actually Dick Feynman

confronted with the fact that doesn't fit the thing that you've really thought through sort of both the negative and the positive of ego, do you see the negative of that get in the way sort of being

way to get into it is to look at sort of the arc of history and to look at what's happened in kind of the development of science."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "I mean, there was this sort of big idea in

on."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "Let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied in programs as a sort of generalization of the ones that can exist in mathematics as a way to describe the world."},

cells."}, {"time": 6556, "text": "Each cell is either black or white."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "And in a series of steps that you can represent as lines going down a page, you're updating the color

be if the cell and its right neighbor are not the same or the cell on the left is black or something, then make it black on the next step."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "And if not, make it white."},

from just one black cell at the top, it makes this extremely complicated pattern."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "So some rules you get a very simple pattern."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Some rules, the rule is simple."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "You start them off from a sort of simple seed."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "You just get this very simple pattern."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "But other rules, and this was the big surprise when I started actually just doing the simple computer experiments to find out what happens, is that they produce very complicated patterns of behavior."}, {"time": 6630,

column of cells, you get a series of values."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "It goes black, white, black, black, whatever it is."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "That sequence seems for all practical purposes random."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "So it's kind of like in math, you compute the digits of pi, 3.1415926, whatever."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "Those digits once computed, I mean, the scheme for computing pi, it's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, very well defined."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "But yet, once you've generated those digits, they seem for all practical purposes completely random."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "And so it is with rule 30, that even though the rule is very simple, much simpler, much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi, even with a rule that simple, you're still generating immensely complicated behavior."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "So if we could just pause on that, I think you probably have said it and looked at it so long, you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don't, you still feel the magic."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "But to me, if you've never seen sort of, I would say, what is it?"}, {"time": 6703, "text": "A one dimensional, essentially, cellular automata, right?"}, {"time": 6709, "text": "And you were to guess what you would see if you have some sort of cells that only respond to its neighbors."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "If you were to guess what kind of things you would see, like my initial guess, like even when I first like opened your book, A New Kind of Science, right?"}, {"time": 6729, "text": "My initial guess is you would see, I mean, it would be a very simple stuff."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "And I think it's a magical experience to realize the kind of complexity, you mentioned rule 30, still your favorite cellular automaton?"}, {"time": 6742, "text": "Still my favorite rule."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "You get complexity, immense complexity, you get arbitrary complexity."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "And when you say randomness down the middle column, that's just one cool way to say that there's incredible complexity."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And that's just, I mean, that's a magical idea."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "However, you start to interpret it, all the reducibility discussions, all that."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "But it's just, I think

for me it was transformational."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "I don't know, we can have all kinds of discussion about computation and so on, but just, you know, I sometimes think if I were on a desert

intuition breaking thing to discover."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "I mean, it's kind of like, you know, you point the computational telescope out the window and you're like, okay, I'm going to point the computational telescope out there."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "And suddenly you see, I don't know, you know, in the past, it's kind of like, you know, moons of Jupiter or something, but suddenly you

the way?"}, {"time": 6848, "text": "Oh, well, I was just generating here."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "I'll actually generate a rule 30 pattern."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "So that's the rule for, for rule 30."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And it says, for example, it says here, if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right, then the cell on the next step will be white."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "And so here's the actual pattern that you get starting off from a single black cell at the top there."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And then that's the

step, you're just applying this rule to find out the new value that you get."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "And so you might think rule that simple, you got to get the, there's got to be some trace of

then out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha, which is the success."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "I mean, yeah, right."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "I think those are in some sense, those efforts were too modest."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "That is they were, they were looking at particular areas and you actually can't do it with a particular area."}, {"time": 8646, "text": "I

relationship between what we've tried to do and sort of the learning side of, of AI."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "You know, in a sense, if you look at the development of knowledge in our civilization as

{"time": 8688, "text": "You can do things which are just use raw human thought."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "And then along came sort of modern mathematical science."}, {"time": 8694, "text": "And we found ways to just sort of blast through that by in that case, in that case, writing down equations."}, {"time": 8701, "text": "Now we also know we can do that with computation and so on."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "And so that was kind of a different thing."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "So, so when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out, one way we could do it is start from scratch, learn everything."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "It's just a neural net figuring everything out."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge based

tried to do."}, {"time": 8739, "text": "And we're not saying just, you don't have to start everything from scratch."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "So in a sense, a big part of what we've done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world in computational form and computable form."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "Now there's also some pieces which, which were for a long time, undoable by computers like image identification, where there's a really, really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were pretty easy for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "I think the thing that's interesting, that's emerging now is the interplay between these things, between this kind of knowledge of the world that is in a sense, very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and so on."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "And putting those together by having this sort of symbolic representation of image identification, that that's where things get really interesting and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "I think that's, you know, that's kind of a part of the path forward, so to speak."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "So the dream of, so the machine learning is not in my view, I think the view of many people is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge that will from language of build."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "But because you have a kind of, you've done the incredibly hard work of building this world, now machine learning can be, can serve as tools to help you explore that world."}, {"time": 8831, "text": "And that's what you've added."}, {"time": 8831, "text": "I mean, with the version 12, right?"}, {"time": 8831, "text": "You added a few, I was seeing some demos, it looks amazing."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "I mean, I think, you know, this, it's sort of interesting to see the, the sort of the, once it's computable, once it's in there, it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way."}, {"time": 8850, "text": "But then there's sort of things like the interface of how do you get there?"}, {"time": 8850, "text": "You know, how do you do natural language understanding to get there?"}, {"time": 8854, "text": "How do you, how do you pick out entities in a big piece of text or something?"}, {"time": 8858, "text": "That's I mean, actually a good example right now is our NLP NLU loop, which is we've done a lot of stuff, natural language understanding using essentially not learning based methods, using a lot of, you know, little algorithmic methods, human curation methods and so on."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "In terms of when people try to enter a query and then converting."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "So the process of converting NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into a computational language, which is a very well, first of all, super practical definition, very useful definition, and then also a very clear definition of natural language understanding."}, {"time": 8901, "text": "I mean, a different thing is natural language processing, where it's like, here's a big lump of text, go pick out all the cities in that text, for example."}, {"time": 8910, "text": "And so a good example of, you know, so we do that, we're using, using modern machine learning techniques."}, {"time": 8915, "text": "And it's actually kind of, kind of an interesting process that's going on right now."}, {"time": 8920, "text": "It's this loop between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding."}, {"time": 8931, "text": "And so we've got this kind of loop going between those, which is improving both of them."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "And I think you have some of the state of the art transformers, like you have BERT in there, I think."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "So it's closely, you have, you have integrating all the models."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "I mean, this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about or talking about."}, {"time": 8947, "text": "I'm actually just surprised, frankly, that Wolfram language is not more popular than it already is."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "You know, that's a, it's a, it's a complicated issue because it's like, it involves, you know, it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed slowly in the world."}, {"time": 8964, "text": "I mean, I think that's And then there's sort of like what we're talking about, there's egos and personalities and some of the, the absorption, absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of personalities and the, and then a little social network."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So it's, it's interesting how the spread of ideas works."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "You know, what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are, if you say, you know, what market sort of market penetration, if you look at the, I would say very high end of R&D and sort of the, the people where you say, wow, that's a really impressive, smart person."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "They're very often users of Wolfram language, very, very often."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "If you look at the more sort of, it's a funny thing."}, {"time": 9012, "text": "If you look at the more kind of, I would say people who are like, oh, we're just plodding away doing what we do."}, {"time": 9016, "text": "They're often not yet Wolfram language users."}, {"time": 9016, "text": "And that dynamic, it's kind of odd that there hasn't been more rapid trickle down because we really, you know, the high end we've really been very successful in for a long time."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And it's, it's, but with, you know, that's partly, I think, a consequence of my fault in a sense, because it's kind of, you know, I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the best possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out in sort of the most effective way."}, {"time": 9059, "text": "And there's an interesting idea that, you know, perhaps you can make it more popular by opening everything up, sort of the GitHub model."}, {"time": 9063, "text": "But there's an interesting, I think I've heard you discuss this, that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases, like in this particular case, that you want it, that when you deeply care about the integrity, the quality of the knowledge that you're building, that, unfortunately, you can't, you can't distribute that effort."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "Yeah, it's not the nature of how things work."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "I mean, you know, what we're trying to do is a thing that for better or worse, requires leadership."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "And it requires kind of maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time, and doing not only the cool vision related work, but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually work well, work."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "So how do you build the knowledge?"}, {"time": 9113, "text": "Because that's the fascinating thing."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "That's the mundane, the fascinating and the mundane is building the knowledge, the adding, integrating more data."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's probably not the most, I mean, the things like get it to work in all these different cloud environments and so on."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "That's pretty, you know, it's very practical stuff, you know, have the user interface be smooth and, you know, have there be take only a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that."}, {"time": 9137, "text": "That's a lot of work."}, {"time": 9137, "text": "And it's, it's, but, you know, I think my, it's an interesting thing over the period of time, you know, often language has existed, basically, for more than half of the total amount of time that any language, any computer language has existed."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "That is, computer language is maybe 60 years old, you know, give or take, and often language is 33 years old."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "So it's, it's kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently, there's been more innovation in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure of programming languages over that period of time."}, {"time": 9174, "text": "And we, you know, we've been sort of trying to do our best to adapt to it."}, {"time": 9180, "text": "And the good news is that we have, you know, because I have a simple private company and so on that doesn't have, you know, a bunch of investors, you know, telling us we've got to do this so that they have lots of freedom in what we can do."}, {"time": 9189, "text": "And so, for example, we're able to, oh, I don't know, we have this free Wolfram engine for developers, which is a free version for developers."}, {"time": 9198, "text": "And we've been, you know, we've, there are site licenses for, for Mathematica and Wolfram language at basically all major universities, certainly in the US by now."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "So it's effectively free to people and all universities in effect."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "And, you know, we've been doing a progression of things."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "I mean, different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example, the main website is just a free website."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "What is Wolfram Alpha?"}, {"time": 9221, "text": "Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for answering questions where you ask a question with natural language, and it'll try and generate a report telling you the answer to that question."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "So the question could be something like, you know, what's the population of Boston divided by New York compared to New York?"}, {"time": 9239, "text": "And it'll take those words and give you an answer."}, {"time": 9246, "text": "And that converts the words into computable, into Wolfram language, into Wolfram language and computational language."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And then do you think the underlying knowledge belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram language?"}, {"time": 9259, "text": "What's the Wolfram knowledge base?"}, {"time": 9264, "text": "Knowledge base."}, {"time": 9264, "text": "I mean, it's been a, that's been a big effort over the decades to collect all that stuff."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "And, you know, more of it flows in every second."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "So can you, can you just pause on that for a second?"}, {"time": 9274, "text": "Like, that's one of the most incredible things, of course, in the long term, Wolfram language itself is the fundamental thing."}, {"time": 9280, "text": "But in the amazing sort of short term, the knowledge base is kind of incredible."}, {"time": 9286, "text": "So what's the process of building that knowledge base?"}, {"time": 9286, "text": "The fact that you, first of all, from the very beginning, that you're brave enough to start to take on the general knowledge base."}, {"time": 9297, "text": "And how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that you have now?"}, {"time": 9306, "text": "Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at some level."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "I mean, I had, I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid."},

{"time": 9326, "text": "Well, the thing that happened with me, which was kind of, it's a, it's a live your own paradigm kind of theory."}, {"time": 9332, "text": "So basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like Wolfram Alpha would require sort of solving the general AI problem."}, {"time": 9338, "text": "That's what I had assumed."}, {"time": 9344, "text": "And so I kept on thinking about that and I thought, I don't really know how to do that."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "So I don't do anything."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "Then I worked on my new kind of science project and sort of exploring the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence, which say there is no bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "So I thought, look, that's this paradigm I've built."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "You know, now it's, you know, now I have to eat that dog food myself, so to speak."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "You know, I've been thinking about doing this thing with computable knowledge forever and, you know, let me actually try and do it."}, {"time": 9376, "text": "And so it was, you know, if my paradigm is right, then this should be possible."}, {"time": 9381, "text": "But the beginning was certainly, you know, it was a bit daunting."}, {"time": 9381, "text": "I remember I took the early team to a big reference library and we're like looking at this reference library and it's like, you know, my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything that's in here."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "And that's, you know, it seemed very daunting, but in a sense, I was well aware of the fact that it's finite."}, {"time": 9403, "text":

not an infinite, you know, it's not the infinite corridor of, so to speak, of reference library."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "It's not truly infinite, so to speak."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "But no, I mean, and then what happened was sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn't start off saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "It was like, let's, you know, implement this area, this area, this area, a few hundred areas and so on."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "I also found that, you know, I've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the world's experts in lots of areas."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "And so that really helped because we were able to ask people, you know, the world expert in this or that, and we're able to ask them for input and so on."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "And I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who helped us figure out what to do wouldn't be right."}, {"time": 9466, "text": "You know, because our goal was to kind of get to the point where we had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "And so that, you know, the ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge in our civilization, make it be automatic to be able to answer that question."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "And, you know, and now, well, Wolfman got used in Siri from the very beginning, and it's now also used in Alexa."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "And so it's people are kind of getting more of the, you know, they get more of the sense of this is what should be possible to do."}, {"time": 9499, "text": "I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time."}, {"time": 9504, "text": "And I had kind of an interesting experience."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "I had a friend, Marvin Minsky, who was a well known AI person from right around here."}, {"time": 9517, "text": "And I remember when Wolfman Alpha was coming out, it was a few weeks before it came out, I think, I happened to see Marvin."},

something."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "And it's like, okay, fine."}, {"time": 9534, "text": "And then he's talking about something different."}, {"time": 9534, "text": "I said, no, Marvin, you know, this time, it actually works."}, {"time": 9538, "text": "You know, look at this, it actually works."}, {"time": 9538, "text": "He's typed in a few more things."}, {"time": 9543, "text": "There's maybe 10 more things."}, {"time": 9543, "text": "Of course, we have a record of what he typed in, which is kind of interesting."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "But and then you can you share where his mind was
