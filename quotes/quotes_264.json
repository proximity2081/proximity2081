something in the famous word of the philosopher Thomas Nagel."}, {"time": 337, "text": "It feels like something to be a bat or to be an American or to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain."}, {"time": 349, "text": "And that is what experience is, any possible experience."}, {"time": 353, "text": "Could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair."}, {"time": 355, "text": "Could be as

you were to sit down with maybe the next, skip a couple generations, of IBM Watson, something that won Jeopardy, what is the gap, I guess the question is, between Watson, that might be much smarter than you, than us, than any human alive, but may not have experience, what is the gap?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "Well, so that's a big, big question."}, {"time": 390, "text": "That's occupied people for the last, certainly last 50 years since we, you know, since the advent, the birth of computers."}, {"time": 399, "text": "That's a question Alan Turing tried to answer."}, {"time": 400, "text": "And of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test, an operational test."}, {"time": 406, "text": "But that's not really, that's, you know, he tried to get at what does it mean for a person to think, and then he had this test, right?"}, {"time": 412, "text": "You lock them away, and then you have a communication with them, and then you try to guess after a while whether that is a person or whether it's a computer system."}, {"time": 420, "text": "There's no question that now or very soon, you know, Alexa or Siri or, you know, Google now will pass this test, right?"}, {"time": 427, "text": "And you can game it, but you know, ultimately, certainly in your generation, there will be machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said."},

"But of course, the key question is, does it feel like anything to be Samantha in the movie Her?"}, {"time": 449, "text": "Or does it feel like anything to be Watson?"}, {"time": 452, "text": "And there one has to very, very strongly think there are two different concepts here that we co mingle."}, {"time": 459, "text": "There is the concept of intelligence, natural or artificial, and there is a concept of consciousness, of experience, natural or artificial."}, {"time": 467, "text": "Those are very, very different things."}, {"time": 469, "text": "Now, historically, we associate consciousness with intelligence."}, {"time": 474, "text": "Because we live in a world, leaving aside computers, of natural selection, where we're surrounded by creatures, either our own kin that are less or more intelligent, or we go across species."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Some are more adapted to a particular environment."}, {"time": 488, "text": "Others are less adapted, whether it's a whale or dog, or you go talk about a paramecium or a little worm."}, {"time": 495, "text": "And we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells, to a worm that has three nets, that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells, to creature like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion, even more nerve cells."}, {"time": 510, "text": "And so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience, we believe that as these creatures become more complex, they are better adapted to their particular ecological niche, and they become more conscious, partly because their brain grows."}, {"time": 526, "text": "And we believe consciousness, unlike the ancient, ancient people thought most, almost every culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart."}, {"time": 535, "text": "And you still see that today."}, {"time": 536, "text": "You see, honey, I love you with all my heart."}, {"time": 539, "text": "But what you should actually say is, no, honey, I love you with all my lateral hypothalamus."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And for Valentine's Day, you should give your sweetheart, you know, hypothalamus, a piece of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate."}, {"time": 551, "text": "Anyway, so we still have this language, but now we believe it's a brain."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so we see brains of different complexity and we think, well, they have different levels of consciousness."}, {"time": 559, "text": "They're capable of different experiences."}, {"time": 565, "text": "But now we confront the world where we know where we're beginning to engineer intelligence."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And it's radical unclear whether the intelligence we're engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can experience anything."}, {"time": 580, "text": "Because fundamentally, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 582, "text": "Intelligence is about function."}, {"time": 584, "text": "Intelligence no matter exactly how you define it, sort of adaptation to new environments, being able to learn and quickly understand, you know, the setup of this and what's going on and who are the actors and what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 595, "text": "That's all about function."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Consciousness is not about function."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Consciousness is about being."}, {"time": 602, "text": "It's in some sense much fundamental."}, {"time": 605, "text": "You can see this in several cases."}, {"time": 608, "text": "You can see it, for instance, in the case of the clinic."}, {"time": 612, "text": "When you're dealing with patients who are, let's say, had a stroke or had were in traffic accident, et cetera, they're pretty much immobile."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Terri Schiavo, you may have heard historically, she was a person here in the 90s in Florida."}, {"time": 626, "text": "Her heart stood still."}, {"time": 627, "text": "She was reanimated."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And then for the next 14 years, she was what's called in a vegetative state."}, {"time": 631, "text": "So there are thousands of people in a vegetative state."}, {"time": 634, "text": "So they're, you know, they're, you know, they're like this."}, {"time": 636, "text": "Occasionally, they open their eyes for two, three, four, five, six, eight hours, and then close their eyes."}, {"time": 641, "text": "They have sleep wake cycle."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Occasionally, they have behaviors."}, {"time": 644, "text": "They do like, you know, but there's no way that you can establish a lawful relationship between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does."}, {"time": 655, "text": "So there isn't any behavior, yet in some of these people, there is still experience."}, {"time": 663, "text": "You can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there's still experience something."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And of course, these cases of locked in state, there's this famous book called The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, where you had an editor, a French editor, he had a stroke in the brainstem, unable to move except his vertical eyes, eye movement."}, {"time": 682, "text": "He could just move his eyes up and down."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And he dictated an entire book."}, {"time": 687, "text": "And some people even lose this at the end."}, {"time": 690, "text": "All the evidence seems to suggest that they're still in there."}, {"time": 693, "text": "In this case, you have no behavior, you have consciousness."}, {"time": 697, "text": "Second case is tonight, like all of us, you're going to go to sleep, close your eyes, you go to sleep, you will wake up inside your sleeping body, and you will have conscious experiences."}, {"time": 707, "text": "They are different from everyday experience."}, {"time": 709, "text": "You might fly, you might not be surprised that you're flying, you might meet a long dead pet, childhood dog, and you're not surprised that you're meeting them."}, {"time": 718, "text": "But you have conscious experience of love, of hate, they can be very emotional."}, {"time": 722, "text": "Your body during this state, typically it's REM state, sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you."}, {"time": 729, "text": "It's called atonia."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Because if you don't have that, like some patients, what do you do?"}, {"time": 734, "text": "You act out your dreams."}, {"time": 735, "text": "You get, for example, REM behavioral disorder, which is bad juju to get."}, {"time": 740, "text": "Third case is pure experience."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So I recently had this, what some people call a mystical experience."}, {"time": 747, "text": "I went to Singapore and went into a flotation tank."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So this is a big tub filled with water, that's body temperature and Epsom salt."},

your body anymore."}, {"time": 772, "text": "There's no sound, soundless."}, {"time": 774, "text": "There's no photon, sightless, timeless, because after a while, early on you actually hear your heart, but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases."}, {"time": 788, "text": "And if you train yourself, like in a meditation, not to think, early on you think a lot."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It's a little bit spooky."}, {"time": 793, "text": "You feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think, well, I'm going to get bored."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And if you try to not to think actively, you become mindless."}, {"time": 800, "text": "There you are, bodiless, timeless, you know, soundless, sightless, mindless, but you're in a conscious experience."}, {"time": 808, "text": "You're not asleep."}, {"time": 811, "text": "You are a being of pure, you're a pure being."}, {"time": 813, "text": "There isn't any function."}, {"time": 814, "text": "You aren't doing

824, "text": "So what is the... You mean epiphenomena."}, {"time": 827, "text": "So what's the select, meaning why, what is the function of you being able to lay in this sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience?"}, {"time": 841, "text": "Evolutionary?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "Evolutionary."}, {"time": 843, "text": "Obviously we didn't evolve with flotation tanks in our environment."}, {"time": 846, "text": "I mean, so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question, telenormical question."}, {"time": 851, "text": "Why do we have two eyes?"}, {"time": 852, "text": "Why don't we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Well, no, there's probably, there is a function to that, but we're not very good at answering those questions."}, {"time": 861, "text": "We can speculate endlessly where biology is very, or science is very good about mechanistic question."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Why is there a charge in the universe?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "We find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Why does quantum mechanics hold?"}, {"time": 873, "text": "You know, why doesn't some other theory hold?"}, {"time": 876, "text": "Quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why."}, {"time": 878, "text": "So telenormical question, why questions are difficult to answer."}, {"time": 882, "text": "There's some relationship between complexity, brain processing power and consciousness."}, {"time": 889, "text": "But however, in these cases, in these three examples I gave, one is an everyday experience at night."}, {"time": 894, "text": "The other one is trauma."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And third one is in principle, you can, everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences."}, {"time": 900, "text": "You have a dissociation of function from, of intelligence from consciousness."}, {"time": 909, "text": "You caught me asking a why question."}, {"time": 912, "text": "Let me ask a question that's not a why question."}, {"time": 915, "text": "You're giving a talk later today on the Turing test for intelligence and consciousness, drawing lines between the two."}, {"time": 921, "text": "So is there a scientific way to say there's consciousness present in this entity or not?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "And to anticipate your answer, cause you, you will also, there's a neurobiological answer."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So we can test the human brain, but if you take a machine brain that you don't know tests for yet, how would you even begin to approach a test if there's consciousness present in this thing?"}, {"time": 947, "text": "That's a really good question."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So let me take it in two steps."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So as you point out for, for, for, for humans, let's just stick with humans."}, {"time": 954, "text": "There's now a test called the Zap and Zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation."}, {"time": 960, "text": "You look at the electrical reverberations essentially using EG, and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And you can do this in awake people, in asleep, normal people, you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them."}, {"time": 973, "text": "You can do it in patients."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And it, it, it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases, when you're clear, the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious, the complexity is either high or low."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and, and, and mice that have very similar brains."}, {"time": 992, "text": "Now of course you, you point out that may not help you because we don't have a cortex, you know, and if I send a magnetic pulse into my iPhone or my computer, it's probably going to break something."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "So we don't have that."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "So what we need ultimately, we need a theory of consciousness."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "We can't just rely on our intuition."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "Our intuition is, well, yeah, if somebody talks, they're conscious."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "However, then there are all these patients, children, babies don't talk, right?"}, {"time": 1016, "text": "But we believe that, that the babies also have conscious experiences, right?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "And then there are all these patients I mentioned and they don't talk."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "When you dream, you can't talk because you're paralyzed."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "So what we ultimately need, we can't just rely on our intuition."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "We need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "What is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that gives rise to conscious experience?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "We all believe, none of us believes anymore in the old story."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It's a soul, right?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "That used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot of people today believe, well, there's, there's God endowed only us with a special thing that animals don't have."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Rene Descartes famously said, a dog, if you hit it with your carriage may yell, may cry, but it doesn't have this special thing."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "It doesn't have the magic, the magic soul."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "It doesn't have res cogitans, the soul."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Now we believe that isn't the case anymore."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So what is the difference between brains and, and these guys, silicon?"}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And in particular, once their behavior matches."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So if you have Siri or Alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human, what grounds do you have to say she's not conscious in particular, if she says it's of course she will, well, of course I'm conscious."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "You ask her how are you doing?"}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And she'll say, well, you know, they, they'll generate some way to, of course she'll behave like a, like a person."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Now there's several differences."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "One is, so this relates to the problem, the very hard, why is consciousness a hard problem?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "It's because it's subjective, right?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Only I have it, for only I know I have direct experience of my own consciousness."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "I don't have experience in your consciousness."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Now I assume as a sort of a Bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all of that, you know, I can do, I can do an abduction to the, to the best available facts."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "I deduce your brain is very similar to mine."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "If I put you in a scanner, your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as I do."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "If, if, if, you know, if I give you this muesli and ask you, how does it taste?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "You tell me things that, you know, that, that I would also say more or less, right?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So I infer based on all of that, that you're conscious."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "Now with theory, I can't do that."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So there I really need a theory that tells me what is it about, about any system, this or this, that makes it conscious."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "We have such a theory."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "So the integrated information theory, but let me first, maybe as an introduction for people who are not familiar, Descartes, can you, you talk a lot about pan, panpsychism."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Can you describe what, uh, physicalism versus dualism?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "This you, you mentioned the soul, what, what is the history of that idea?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "What is the idea of panpsychism or no, the debate really, uh, out of which panpsychism can, um, emerge of, of, of, um, dualism versus, uh, physicalism or do you not see panpsychism as fitting into that?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "No, you can argue there's some, okay, so let's step back."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So panpsychism is a very ancient belief that's been around, uh, I mean, Plato and Aristotle talks about it, uh, modern philosophers talk about it."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Of course, in Buddhism, the idea is very prevalent that, I mean, there are different versions of it."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "One version says everything is ensouled, everything, rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest and iPhones, all of us all, right?"}, {"time": 1214, "text": "All matter is ensouled."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "That's sort of one version."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Another version is that all biology, all creatures, small or large, from a single cell to a giant sequoia tree feel like something."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "This one I think is somewhat more realistic."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Um, so the different versions, what do you mean by feel like something, have, have feelings, have some kind of, it feels like something, it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a paramecium."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "I think it's pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So, so that you can see that's also, so panpsychism is very broad and you can, so some people, for example, Bertrand Russell, tried to advocate this, this idea, it's called Rasselian Monism, that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "So the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity, right?"}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You know, describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution, okay?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "That's the relationship among things."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Physics doesn't really describe the ultimate reality itself."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "It's just relationship among, you know, quarks or all these other stuff from like a third person observer."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And consciousness is what physics feels from the inside."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So my conscious experience, it's the way the physics of my brain, particularly my cortex feels from the inside."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And so if you are paramecium, you got to remember, you say paramecium, well, that's a pretty dumb creature."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "It is, but it has already a billion different molecules, probably, you know, 5,000 different proteins assembled in a highly, highly complex system that no single person, no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Its complexity vastly escapes us."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Now, it doesn't have a voice in the head like me."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "It doesn't have expectations."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "You know, it doesn't have all that complex things, but it may well feel like something."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So this is really interesting."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life, intelligence and consciousness?"}, {"time": 1343, "text": "How do you see all of those?"}, {"time": 1345, "text": "If you had to define what is a living thing, what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Do those intermix for you or are they totally separate?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So A, that's a question that we don't have a full answer to."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "A lot of the stuff we're talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones, right?"}, {"time": 1363, "text": "For example, you can go to Aristotle, who's probably the most important scientist and philosopher who's ever lived in, certainly in Western culture."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "He had this idea, it's called hylomorphism."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "It's quite popular these days, that there are different forms of soul."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "The soul is really the form of something."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "He says, all biological creatures have a vegetative soul."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "That's life principle."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Today, we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Then he said they have a sensitive soul."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "They can see, they can smell, and they have drives."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "They want to reproduce, they want to eat, et cetera."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And then only humans have what he called a rational soul, okay?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And that idea then made it into Christendom and then the rational soul is the one that lives forever."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "He was very unclear."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "He wasn't really, I mean, different readings of Aristotle give different, whether did he believe that rational soul was immortal or not."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "I probably think he didn't."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "But then, of course, that made it through Plato into Christianity, and then this soul became immortal and then became the connection to God."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So you ask me, essentially, what is our modern conception of these three, Aristotle would have called them different forms."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Life, we think we know something about it, at least life on this planet, right?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Although we don't understand how to originate it, but it's been difficult to rigorously pin down."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "You see this in modern definitions of death."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "In fact, right now, there's a conference ongoing, again, that tries to define legally and medically what is death."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "It used to be very simple."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Death is you stop breathing, your heart stops beating, you're dead, totally uncontroversial."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "If you're unsure, you wait another 10 minutes."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "If the patient doesn't breathe, he's dead."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Well, now we have ventilators, we have heart pacemakers, so it's much more difficult to define what death

organism that survived were gigantic clouds of little hexagonal universal cellular automata."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "This was written in the 60s, so typically they're all lying on the ground

beat anything that humans can throw at it."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "It's very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans leave the planet, they're simply unable
