20 days."}, {"time": 268, "text": "We wanted to get 120,000 hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 276, "text": "So it's a lot of hands for humans to play, even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally."}, {"time": 282, "text": "So we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands."}, {"time": 286, "text": "20 days, they were playing basically morning to evening."}, {"time": 290, "text": "And I raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play."}, {"time": 295, "text": "And the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000."}, {"time": 301, "text": "We actually paid them out based on how they did against the AI each."}, {"time": 305, "text": "So they had an incentive to play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating the AI."}, {"time": 313, "text": "And you don't make any money, unfortunately."}, {"time": 316, "text": "Right, no, we can't make any money."}, {"time": 317, "text": "So originally, a couple of years earlier, I actually explored whether we could actually play for money because that would be, of course, interesting as well, to play against the top people for money."}, {"time": 329, "text": "But the Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no, so we couldn't."}, {"time": 333, "text": "So this is much like an exhibit, like for a musician or a boxer or something like that."}, {"time": 339, "text": "Nevertheless, they were keeping track of the money and brought us close to $2 million, I think."}, {"time": 348, "text": "So if it was for real money, if you were able to earn money, that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement."}, {"time": 355, "text": "Just a few details, what were the players looking at?"}, {"time": 359, "text": "Were they behind a computer?"}, {"time": 360, "text": "What was the interface like?"}, {"time": 362, "text": "Yes, they were playing much like they normally do."}, {"time": 365, "text": "These top players, when they play this game, they play mostly online."}, {"time": 368, "text": "So they're used to playing through a UI."}, {"time": 371, "text": "And they did the same thing here."}, {"time": 373, "text": "So there was this layout."}, {"time": 374, "text": "You could imagine there's a table on a screen."}, {"time": 377, "text": "There's the human sitting there, and then there's the AI sitting there."}, {"time": 381, "text": "And the screen shows everything that's happening."}, {"time": 384, "text": "The cards coming out and shows the bets being made."}, {"time": 387, "text": "And we also had the betting history for the human."}, {"time": 389, "text": "So if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far, they could actually reference back and so forth."}, {"time": 397, "text": "Is there a reason they were given access to the betting history for?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "Well, we just, it didn't really matter."}, {"time": 405, "text": "They wouldn't have forgotten anyway."}, {"time": 407, "text": "These are top quality people."}, {"time": 408, "text": "But we just wanted to put out there so it's not a question of the human forgetting and the AI somehow trying to get advantage of better memory."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So what was that like?"}, {"time": 417, "text": "I mean, that was an incredible accomplishment."}, {"time": 419, "text": "So what did it feel like before the event?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "Did you have doubt, hope?"}, {"time": 425, "text": "Where was your confidence at?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "Yeah, that's great."}, {"time": 429, "text": "So great question."}, {"time": 430, "text": "So 18 months earlier, I had organized a similar brains versus AI competition with a previous AI called Cloudyco and we couldn't beat the humans."}, {"time": 440, "text": "So this time around, it was only 18 months later."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And I knew that this new AI, Libratus, was way stronger, but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans before you try."}, {"time": 452, "text": "So I thought we had about a 50, 50 shot."}, {"time": 455, "text": "And the international betting sites put us as a four to one or five to one underdog."}, {"time": 461, "text": "So it's kind of interesting that people really believe in people and over AI, not just people."}, {"time": 468, "text": "People don't just over believe in themselves, but they have overconfidence in other people as well compared to the performance of AI."}, {"time": 475, "text": "And yeah, so we were a four to one or five to one underdog."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And even after three days of beating the humans in a row, we were still 50, 50 on the international betting sites."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Do you think there's something special and magical about poker and the way people think about it, in the sense you have, I mean, even in chess, there's no Hollywood movies."}, {"time": 497, "text": "Poker is the star of many movies."}, {"time": 501, "text": "And there's this feeling that certain human facial expressions and body language, eye movement, all these tells are critical to poker."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Like you can look into somebody's soul and understand their betting strategy and so on."}, {"time": 517, "text": "So that's probably why, possibly, do you think that is why people have a confidence that humans will outperform?"}, {"time": 525, "text": "Because AI systems cannot, in this construct, perceive these kinds of tells."}, {"time": 531, "text": "They're only looking at betting patterns and nothing else, betting patterns and statistics."}, {"time": 538, "text": "So what's more important to you if you step back on human players, human versus human?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "What's the role of these tells, of these ideas that we romanticize?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Yeah, so I'll split it into two parts."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So one is why do humans trust humans more than AI and have overconfidence in humans?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "I think that's not really related to the tell question."}, {"time": 565, "text": "It's just that they've seen these top players, how good they are, and they're really fantastic."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So it's just hard to believe that an AI could beat them."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So I think that's where that comes from."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And that's actually maybe a more general lesson about AI."}, {"time": 580, "text": "That until you've seen it overperform a human, it's hard to believe that it could."}, {"time": 585, "text": "But then the tells, a lot of these top players, they're so good at hiding tells that among the top players, it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tells in each other because they're so good at hiding them."}, {"time": 605, "text": "So yes, at the kind of Friday evening game, tells are gonna be a huge thing."}, {"time": 611, "text": "You can read other people."}, {"time": 613, "text": "And if you're a good reader, you'll read them like an open book."}, {"time": 616, "text": "But at the top levels of poker now, the tells become a much smaller and smaller aspect of the game as you go to the top levels."}, {"time": 624, "text": "The amount of strategies, the amount of possible actions is very large, 10 to the power of 100 plus."}, {"time": 635, "text": "So there has to be some, I've read a few of the papers related, it has to form some abstractions of various hands and actions."}, {"time": 644, "text": "So what kind of abstractions are effective for the game of poker?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "Yeah, so you're exactly right."}, {"time": 650, "text": "So when you go from a game tree that's 10 to the 161, especially in an imperfect information game, it's way too large to solve directly, even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms."}, {"time": 663, "text": "So you wanna abstract it first."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in MDPs or other single agent settings."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Because you have these abstraction pathologies that if I have a finer grained abstraction, the strategy that I can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy I can get from the coarse grained abstraction."}, {"time": 687, "text": "So you have to be very careful."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Now the kinds of abstractions, just to zoom out, we're talking about, there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting strategies."}, {"time": 697, "text": "Yeah, betting actions, yeah."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Baiting actions."}, {"time": 699, "text": "So there's information abstraction, don't talk about general games, information abstraction, which is the abstraction of what chance does."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And this would be the cards in the case of poker."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And then there's action abstraction, which is abstracting the actions of the actual players, which would be bets in the case of poker."}, {"time": 719, "text": "Yourself and the other players?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "Yes, yourself and other players."}, {"time": 723, "text": "And for information abstraction, we were completely automated."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So these are algorithms, but they do what we call potential aware abstraction, where we don't just look at the value of the hand, but also how it might materialize into good or bad hands over time."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And it's a certain kind of bottom up process with integer programming there and clustering and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "And then in the action abstraction, there it's largely based on how humans and other AIs have played this game in the past."}, {"time": 762, "text": "But in the beginning, we actually used an automated action abstraction technology, which is provably convergent that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes, but it's not very scalable."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So we couldn't use it for the whole game, but we use it for the first couple of betting actions."}, {"time": 779, "text": "So what's more important, the strength of the hand, so the information abstraction or the how you play them, the actions, does it, you know, the romanticized notion again, is that it doesn't matter what hands you have, that the actions, the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have."}, {"time": 800, "text": "Yeah, so that's why you have to play a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller."}, {"time": 806, "text": "So you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then you're gonna win the match."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky because there's so much variance in No Limit Texas Holden because if we both go all in, it's a huge stack of variance, so there are these massive swings in No Limit Texas Holden."}, {"time": 827, "text": "So that's why you have to play not just thousands, but over 100,000 hands to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 835, "text": "So let me ask another way this question."}, {"time": 837, "text": "If you didn't even look at your hands, but they didn't know that, the opponents didn't know that, how well would you be able to do?"}, {"time": 846, "text": "Oh, that's a good question."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's actually, I heard this story that there's this Norwegian female poker player called Annette Oberstad who's actually won a tournament by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So you cannot really play well that way."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Okay, so the hands do have some role to play, okay."}, {"time": 867, "text": "So Labradus does not use, as far as I understand, they use learning methods, deep learning."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Is there room for learning in, there's no reason why Labradus doesn't combine with an AlphaGo type approach for estimating the quality for function estimator."}, {"time": 889, "text": "What are your thoughts on this, maybe as compared to another algorithm which I'm not that familiar with, DeepStack, the engine that does use deep learning, that it's unclear how well it does, but nevertheless uses deep learning."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So what are your thoughts about learning methods to aid in the way that Labradus plays in the game of poker?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "Yeah, so as you said, Labradus did not use learning methods and played very well without them."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Since then, we have actually, actually here, we have a couple of papers on things that do use learning techniques."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And deep learning in particular."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function, but in imperfect information games, unlike let's say in Go or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players beliefs."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Like if I have a bad hand, I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I have a good hand and vice versa."}, {"time": 965, "text": "If I have a good hand, I'm much better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So the value of a state is not just a function of the cards."}, {"time": 975, "text": "It depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that it's captured in the belief distributions."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And I don't wanna say it's simple there either."}, {"time": 991, "text": "It's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually, it's very straightforward."}, {"time": 996, "text": "There's a state, there's an evaluation function."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You can try to learn it."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Here, you have to do something more."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "And that is a different way of doing it."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And it doesn't assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And that forces us to not be too optimistic in a look ahead search."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And you were asking about DeepStack."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "What they did, it was very different than what we do, either in Libratus or in this new work."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "They were randomly generating various situations in the game."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Then they were doing the look ahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states, but the states were not just the physical states."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "They include belief distributions."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "When you talk about look ahead for DeepStack or with Libratus, does it mean, considering every possibility that the game can evolve, are we talking about extremely, sort of this exponentially growth of a tree?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yes, so we're talking about exactly that."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "Much like you do in alpha beta search or Monte Carlo tree search, but with different techniques."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So there's a different search algorithm."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And then we have to deal with the leaves differently."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "So if you think about what Libratus did, we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of the game."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what the payout is."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It didn't do these depth limited lookaheads, but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited, I think it's called depth limited search for imperfect information games, we can actually do sound depth limited lookahead."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So we can actually start to do the look ahead from the beginning of the game on, because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So in Libratus, we were just doing it for the end."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So, and then the other side, this belief distribution, so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs that the opponent might have?"}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "The beliefs are actually output, not input."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Of course, the starting beliefs are input, but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the deck, so I know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "I know that for a fact, that just follows from the rules of the game."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Of course, except the two cards that I have, I know you don't have those."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "You have to take that into account."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "That's called card removal and that's very important."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "Is the dealing always coming from a single deck in Heads Up, so you can assume."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Single deck, so you know that if I have the ace of spades, I know you don't have an ace of spades."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Great, so in the beginning, your belief is basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands, but how do you start to adjust that belief?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "Well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So Nash equilibrium, which John Nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than one player."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base roll."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games, Nash equilibrium, it doesn't just define strategies."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "It also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So at each state, it's called information sets."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "At each information set in the game, there's a set of different states that we might be in, but I don't know which one we're in."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is the probability distribution over those real world states in my mind."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "How does Nash equilibrium give you that distribution?"}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I'll do a simple example."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So you know the game Rock, Paper, Scissors?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So we can draw it as player one moves first and then player two moves."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "But of course, it's important that player two doesn't know what player one moved, otherwise player two would win every time."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So we can draw that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first, and then there's an information set for player two."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But once we know the strategy for player one, Nash equilibrium will say that you play 1 3rd Rock, 1 3rd Paper, 1 3rd Scissors."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "From that, I can derive my beliefs on the information set that they're 1 3rd, 1 3rd, 1 3rd."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So Bayes gives you that."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Bayes gives you."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "But is that specific to a particular player, or is it something you quickly update with the specific player?"}, {"time": 1325, "text": "No, the game theory isn't really player specific."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So that's also why we don't need any data."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "We don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any AI or human had played before."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's all about rationality."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So the AI just thinks about what would a rational opponent do?"}, {"time": 1344, "text": "And what would I do if I am rational?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And that's the idea of game theory."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So it's really a data free, opponent free approach."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So it comes from the design of the game as opposed to the design of the player."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Exactly, there's no opponent modeling per se."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I mean, we've done some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory so you can exploit weak players even more, but that's another strand."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And in Librarus, we didn't turn that on."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So I decided that these players are too good."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And when you start to exploit an opponent, you typically open yourself up to exploitation."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world's leading experts in counter exploitation."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "So I decided that we're not gonna turn that stuff on."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Actually, I saw a few of your papers exploiting opponents."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "It sounded very interesting to explore."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "Do you think there's room for exploitation generally outside of Librarus?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Is there a subject or people differences that could be exploited, maybe not just in poker, but in general interactions and negotiations, all these other domains that you're considering?"}, {"time": 1414, "text": "We've done some work on that."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And I really like the work at hybrid digested too."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So you figure out what would a rational opponent do."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "And by the way, that's safe in these zero sum games, two player zero sum games, because if the opponent does something irrational, yes, it might throw off my beliefs, but the amount that the player can gain by throwing off my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So it's safe."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "But still, if somebody's weak as a player, you might wanna play differently to exploit them more."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "So you can think about it this way, a game theoretic strategy is unbeatable, but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So the winnings per hand might be better with a different strategy."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "And the hybrid is that you start from a game theoretic approach."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And then as you gain data about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree, then in those parts of the game tree, you start to tweak your strategy more and more towards exploitation while still staying fairly close to the game theoretic strategy so as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "How do you do that?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Do you try to vary up strategies, make it unpredictable?"}, {"time": 1493, "text": "It's like, what is it, tit for tat strategies in Prisoner's Dilemma or?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Well, that's a repeated game."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Repeated games."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Simple Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated games."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "But even there, there's no proof that says that that's the best thing."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "But experimentally, it actually does well."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "So what kind of games are there, first of all?"}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I don't know if this is something that you could just summarize."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "There's perfect information games where all the information's on the table."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "There is imperfect information games."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "There's repeated games that you play over and over."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "There's zero sum games."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "There's non zero sum games."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And then there's a really important distinction you're making, two player versus more players."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So what are, what other games are there?"}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And what's the difference, for example, with this two player game versus more players?"}, {"time": 1550, "text": "What are the key differences in your view?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So let me start from the basics."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "So a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "In these extensive form games, where it's, think about three form, maybe with these information sets to represent incomplete information, you can have kind of repetitive interactions."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "But the game doesn't have to be exactly the same."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "It's like in sourcing auctions."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Yes, we're gonna see the same supply base year to year, but what I'm buying is a little different every time."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And the supply base is a little different every time and so on."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So it's not really repeated."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "So to find a purely

conceptually easier and computationally easier."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "They're still huge like this one, but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that conceptually, you don't

some things unknown."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "Can you give an example of a collusion type game or is it usually?"}, {"time": 1916, "text": "So like bridge."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So think about bridge."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "It's like when you and I are on a team, our payoffs are the same."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "The problem is that we can't talk."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "So when I get my cards, I can't whisper to you what my cards are."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "That would not be allowed."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So we have to somehow coordinate our strategies ahead of time

the opponents in games, the prerequisite is that you formalize the interaction in some way that can be amenable to analysis."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And you've done this amazing work with mechanism

situations to negotiate manually."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So you could use automated negotiation, this is the idea at least, you could use automated negotiation to negotiate all of these situations

that for a second, there was no, how did you know these are the right guys, this is the right decision, you didn't think it was just follow the heart kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Well, I didn't know, but, you know, just trying something for a month during IAP seems pretty low risk, right?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And then, you know, well, maybe I'll take a semester off, MIT's pretty flexible about that, you can always go back, right?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "And then after two or three cycles of that, I eventually threw in the towel, but, you know, I think it's, I guess in that

would be difficult for a lot of people to make."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "It wasn't as popular, I'd say that the general, you know, flux of people out of MIT at the time was mostly into, you know,

the times, I guess."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So there's a story about midnight of March 18, 2007, where TechCrunch, I guess, announced Justin.TV earlier than it was supposed to, a few hours."},

behind a whiteboard?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Were you doing, uh, Yeah, it was a little, it was a little, yeah, it's a little lonely because there's four of us working on the company and only two people really wrote code."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "And Emmett wrote the website and the chat system and I wrote the software for this video streaming device and video server."}, {"time": 1354,

was, that was a good thing."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "It felt, felt good to entertain people."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "But I figured like, you know, what is really the point of becoming a really good engineer and developing these skills other than, you know, my own enjoyment?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "And I realized I wanted something that scratched more of an existential itch, like something that, that truly matters."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And so I basically made this list of requirements for a new, if I was going to do another company, and the one thing I knew in the back of my head that Twitch took like eight years to become successful."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And so whatever I do, I better be willing to commit, you know, at least 10 years to something."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And when you think about things from that perspective, you certainly, I think, raise the bar on what you choose to work on."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So for me, the three things were it had to be something where the technology itself determines the success of the product, like hard, really juicy technology problems, because that's what motivates me."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "And then it had to have a direct and positive impact on society in some way."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So an example would be like, you know, health care, self driving cars, because they save lives, other things where there's a clear connection to somehow improving other people's lives."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And the last one is it had to be a big business, because for the positive impact to matter, it's got to be a large scale."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And I was thinking about that for a while, and I made like, I tried writing a Gmail clone and looked at some other ideas."}, {"time":

"text": "And I poked around and looked at, the only other thing out there really at the time was the Google self driving car project."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And I thought, surely there's a way to, you know, have an entrepreneur mindset and sort of solve the minimum viable product here."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "And so I just took the plunge right then and there and said, this is something I know I can commit 10 years to."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's the probably the greatest applied AI problem of our generation."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And if it works, it's going to be both a huge

got to work."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Did you have an idea how to solve this problem?"}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Which aspect of the problem to solve?"}, {"time": 1548, "text": "You know, slow, like we just had Oliver from Voyage here, slow moving retirement communities, urban driving, highway driving."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Did you have, like, did you have a vision of the city of the future

the situation is that Google is putting a lot, had been putting a lot of money into that project."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "They had a lot more resources."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And so, and they still hadn't cracked the fully driverless car."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You know, this is 2013, I guess."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So I thought, what can I do to sort of go from zero to, you know, significant scale so I can actually solve the real problem, which is the driverless cars."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And I thought, here's the strategy."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "We'll start by doing a really simple problem or solving a really simple problem that creates value for people."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So, eventually ended up deciding on automating highway driving, which is relatively more straightforward as long as there's a backup driver there."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And, you know, the go to market will be able to retrofit people's cars and just sell these products directly."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And the idea was, we'll take all the revenue and profits from that and use it to do the, so sort of reinvest that in research for doing fully driverless cars."},

we had it working, you know, on a prototype stage."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "But we just completely abandoned that and said, we're going to go all in on driverless cars now is the time."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Can't think of anything that's more exciting and if it works more impactful, so we're just going to go for it."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "The idea of retrofit is kind of interesting."},

of your mind as a possibility?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Not at all."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "I've come full circle on that one."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "After trying to build a retrofit product,

comes to something that has safety critical implications like controlling the steering and other control inputs on your car, it's pretty hard to get there with a retrofit."}, {"time": 1696, "text":

vehicle fails and causes your system to fail, whose fault is it?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Or if the car's anti lock brake systems or other things kick in or the software has been, it's different in one version of the car you retrofit versus another and you don't know because the manufacturer has updated it behind the scenes."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "There's basically an infinite list of long tail issues that can get you."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And if you're dealing with a safety critical product, that's not really acceptable."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "That's a really convincing summary of why that's really challenging."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "But I didn't know all that at the time, so we tried it anyway."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "But as a pitch also at the time, it's a really strong one."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Because that's how you achieve scale and that's how you beat the current, the leader at the time of Google or the only one in the market."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "The other big problem we ran into, which is perhaps the biggest problem from a business model perspective, is we had kind of assumed that we started with an Audi S4 as the vehicle we retrofitted with this highway driving capability."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And we had kind of assumed that if we just knock out like three make and models of vehicles, that'll cover like 80% of the San Francisco market."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Doesn't everyone there drive, I don't know, a BMW or a Honda Civic or one of these three cars?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And then we surveyed our users and we found out that it's all over the place."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "We would, to get even a decent number of units sold, we'd have to support like, you know, 20 or 50 different models."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And each one is a little butterfly that takes time and effort to maintain, you know, that retrofit integration and custom hardware and all this."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "So it was a tough business."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "So GM manufactures and sells over 9 million cars a year."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And what you with Cruise are trying to do some of the most cutting edge innovation in terms of applying AI."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And so how do those, you've talked about a little bit before, but it's also just fascinating to me."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "We work a lot of automakers, you know, the difference between the gap between Detroit and Silicon Valley, let's say, just to be sort of poetic about it, I guess."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "How do you close that gap?"}, {"time": 1817, "text": "How do you take GM into the future where a large part of the fleet will be autonomous, perhaps?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "I want to start by acknowledging that GM is made up of, you know, tens of thousands of really brilliant, motivated people who want to be a part of the future."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "And so it's pretty fun to work within the attitude inside a car company like that is, you know, embracing this transformation and change rather than fearing it."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And I think that's a testament to the leadership at GM and that's flown all the way through to everyone you talk to, even the people in the assembly plants working on these cars."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So that's really great."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So starting from that position makes it a lot easier so then when the people in San Francisco at Cruise interact with the people at GM, at least we have this common set of values, which is that we really want this stuff to work because we think it's important and we think it's the future."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "That's not to say, you know, those two cultures don't clash."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "They absolutely do."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "There's different sort of value systems."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Like in a car company, the thing that gets you promoted and sort of the reward system is following the processes, delivering the program on time and on budget."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "So any sort of risk taking is discouraged in many ways because if a program is late or if you shut down the plant for a day, it's, you know, you can count the millions of dollars that burn by pretty quickly."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Whereas I think, you know, most Silicon Valley companies and in Cruise and the methodology we were employing, especially around the time of the acquisition, the reward structure is about trying to solve these complex problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas that, you know, 90% of them won't work."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "And so meshing that culture of sort of continuous improvement and experimentation with one where everything needs to be rigorously defined up front so that you never slip a deadline or miss a budget was a pretty big challenge."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And that we're over three years in now after the acquisition and I'd say like, you know, the investment we made in figuring out how to work together successfully and who should do what and how we bridge the gaps between these very different systems and way of doing engineering work is now one of our greatest assets because I think we have this really powerful thing."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "But for a while it was both GM and Cruise were very steep on the learning curve."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Yeah, so I'm sure it was very stressful."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "It's really important work because that's how to revolutionize the transportation, really to revolutionize any system."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "You know, you look at the health care system or you look at the legal system."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "I have people like Loris come up to me all the time like everything they're working on can easily be automated."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "But then that's not a good feeling."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Yeah, well it's not a good feeling but also there's no way to automate because the entire infrastructure is really, you know, based is older and it moves very slowly."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so how do you close the gap between I have an how can I replace, of course, Loris don't want to be replaced with an app, but you could replace a lot of aspect when most of the data is still on paper."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "And so the same thing was with automotive."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "I mean, it's fundamentally software."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "It's basically hiring software engineers."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "It's thinking in a software world."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "I mean, I'm pretty sure nobody in Silicon Valley has ever hit a deadline."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "So and then on GM."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "That's probably true, yeah."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "And GM side is probably the opposite."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "So that's that culture gap is really fascinating."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "So you're optimistic about the future of that?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "Yeah, I mean, from what I've seen, it's impressive."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And I think like especially in Silicon Valley, it's easy to write off building cars because, you know, people have been doing that for over 100 years now in this country."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And so it seems like that's a solved problem, but that doesn't mean it's an easy problem."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And I think it would be easy to sort of overlook that and think that, you know, we're Silicon Valley engineers."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "We can solve any problem, you know, building a car."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "It's been done."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Therefore, it's, you know, it's not a real engineering challenge."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But after having seen just the sheer scale and magnitude and industrialization that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant, that is a lot of work that I am very glad that we don't have to reinvent to make self driving cars work."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And so to have, you know, partners who have done that for 100 years now, these great processes and this huge infrastructure and supply base that we can tap into is just remarkable because the scope and surface area of the problem of deploying fleets of self driving cars is so large that we're constantly looking for ways to do less so we can focus on the things that really matter more."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And if we had to figure out how to build and assemble and you know, build the cars themselves."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "I mean, we work closely with GM on that."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "But if we had to develop all that capability in house as well, you know, that would just make the problem really intractable, I think."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So yeah, just like your first entry at the MIT DARPA challenge when there was what the motor that failed, somebody that knows what they're doing with the motor did it."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "That would have been nice if we could focus on the software, not the hardware platform."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "So from your perspective now, you know, there's so many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact society in the next year, five years, ten years."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "What do you think is the biggest opportunity to make money in autonomous driving, sort of make it a financially viable thing in the near term?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "What do you think will be the biggest impact there?"}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Well, the things that drive the economics for fleets of self driving cars are, there's sort of a handful of variables."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "One is, you know, the cost to build the vehicle itself."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So the material cost, how many, you know, what's the cost of all your sensors plus the cost of the vehicle and every all the other components on it."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Another one is the lifetime of the vehicle."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It's very different if your vehicle drives 100,000 miles and then it falls apart versus, you know, two million."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And then, you know, if you have a fleet, it's kind of like an airplane or an airline where once you produce the vehicle, you want it to be in operation as many hours a day as possible producing revenue."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And then, you know, the other piece of that is how are you generating revenue?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "I think that's kind of what you're asking."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And I think the obvious things today are, you know, the ride sharing business because that's pretty clear that there's demand for that, there's existing markets you can tap into and large urban areas, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And I think that there are some real benefits to having cars without drivers compared to sort of the status quo for people who use ride share services today."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "You know, you get privacy, consistency, hopefully significantly improve safety, all these benefits versus the current product."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "But it's a crowded market."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "And then other opportunities, which you've seen a lot of activity in the last, really in the last six or twelve months, is, you know, delivery, whether that's parcels and packages, food or groceries."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "Those are all sort of, I think, opportunities that are pretty ripe for these, you know, once you have this core technology, which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles, there's all sorts of different business opportunities you can build on top of that."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "But I think the important thing, of course, is that there's zero monetization opportunity until you actually have that fleet of very capable driverless cars that are that are as good or better than humans."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And that's sort of where the entire industry is sort of in this holding pattern right now."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Yeah, they're trying to achieve that baseline."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So, but you said sort of not reliability, consistency."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It's kind of interesting, I think I heard you say somewhere, I'm not sure if that's what you meant, but you know, I can imagine a situation where you would get an autonomous vehicle and, you know, when you get into an Uber or Lyft, you don't get to choose the driver in a sense that you don't get to choose the personality of the driving."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Do you think there's a, there's room to define the personality of the car the way it drives you in terms of aggressiveness, for example, in terms of sort of pushing the bound?"}, {"time": 2299, "text": "One of the biggest challenges of autonomous driving is the is the trade off between sort of safety and assertiveness."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "And do you think there's any room for the human to take a role in that decision?"},

I would think about that is let's flip that question around."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So what would prevent you to reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles?"}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And that's a good, that's a good rephrasing."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So the, I'd say the, it seems the consensus among the people developing self driving cars today is to sort of start with some form of an easier environment, whether it means, you know, lacking inclement weather or, you know, mostly sunny or whatever it is."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "And then add, add capability for more complex situations over time."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "And so if you're only able to deploy in areas that meet sort of your criteria or the current domain, you know, operating domain of the software you developed, that may put a cap on how many cities you could deploy in."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "But then as those restrictions start to fall away, like maybe you add capability to drive really well and safely in heavy rain or snow, you know, that, that probably opens up the market by two, two or three fold in terms of the cities you can expand into and so on."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "And so the real question is, you know, I know today if we wanted to, we could produce that, that many autonomous vehicles, but we wouldn't be able to make use of all of them yet."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "Cause we would sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we would want to operate initially."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So if I were to guess like what the timeline is for those things

actually like, you know, lay awake at night thinking about these problems and how to solve them."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "And I think that's helpful because when you start a business, there are like

true passion that you can fall back on and knowing that you would be doing it, even if you weren't getting paid for it, helps you weather those, those tough times."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So that's one thing."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "I think the other one is really good people."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "So I've always been surrounded by really good cofounders that are logical thinkers are

describe what it is, how it evolved through the three generations since you first put it on paper?"}, {"time": 875, "text": "Yeah, so one of the things that neuroscientists just sort of missed for many, many years, and especially people who were thinking about theory, was the nature of time in the brain."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Brains process information through time."}, {"time": 891, "text": "The information coming into the brain is constantly changing."}, {"time": 895, "text": "The patterns from my speech right now, if you were listening to it at normal speed, would be changing on your ears about every 10 milliseconds or so, you'd have a change."}, {"time": 904, "text": "This constant flow, when you look at the world, your eyes are moving constantly, three to five times a second, and the input's completely changing."}, {"time": 911, "text": "If I were to touch something like a coffee cup, as I move my fingers, the input changes."}, {"time": 915, "text": "So this idea that the brain works on time changing patterns is almost completely, or was almost completely missing from a lot of the basic theories, like fears of vision and so on."}, {"time": 925, "text": "It's like, oh no, we're gonna put this image in front of you and flash it and say, what is it?"}, {"time": 929, "text": "Convolutional neural networks work that way today, right?"}, {"time": 932, "text": "Classify this picture."}, {"time": 934, "text": "But that's not what vision is like."}, {"time": 935, "text": "Vision is this sort of crazy time based pattern that's going all over the place, and so is touch and so is hearing."}, {"time": 941, "text": "So the first part of hierarchical temporal memory was the temporal part."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's to say, you won't understand the brain, nor will you understand intelligent machines unless you're dealing with time based patterns."}, {"time": 952, "text": "The second thing was, the memory component of it was, is to say that we aren't just processing input, we learn a model of the world."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And the memory stands for that model."}, {"time": 965, "text": "The point of the brain, the part of the neocortex, it learns a model of the world."}, {"time": 968, "text": "We have to store things, our experiences, in a form that leads to a model of the world."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So we can move around the world, we can pick things up and do things and navigate and know how it's going on."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So that's what the memory referred to."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And many people just, they were thinking about like certain processes without memory at all."}, {"time": 985, "text": "They're just like processing things."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And then finally, the hierarchical component was a reflection to that the neocortex, although it's this uniform sheet of cells, different parts of it project to other parts, which project to other parts."}, {"time": 999, "text": "And there is a sort of rough hierarchy in terms of that."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "So the hierarchical temporal memory is just saying, look, we should be thinking about the brain as time based, model memory based, and hierarchical processing."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And that was a placeholder for a bunch of components that we would then plug into that."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "We still believe all those things I just said, but we now know so much more that I'm stopping to use the word hierarchical temporal memory yet because it's insufficient to capture the stuff we know."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So again, it's not incorrect, but it's, I now know more and I would rather describe it more accurately."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Yeah, so you're basically, we could think of HTM as emphasizing that there's three aspects of intelligence that are important to think about whatever the eventual theory it converges to."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So in terms of time, how do you think of nature of time across different time scales?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "So you mentioned things changing, sensory inputs changing every 10, 20 minutes."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "What about every few minutes, every few months and years?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Well, if you think about a neuroscience problem, the brain problem, neurons themselves can stay active for certain periods of time, parts of the brain where they stay active for minutes."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "You could hold a certain perception or an activity for a certain period of time, but most of them don't last that long."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And so if you think about your thoughts are the activity of neurons, if you're gonna wanna involve something that happened a long time ago, even just this morning, for example, the neurons haven't been active throughout that time."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So you have to store that."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So if I ask you, what did you have for breakfast today?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "That is memory, that is you've built into your model the world now, you remember that."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And that memory is in the synapses, is basically in the formation of synapses."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "And so you're sliding into what, you know, it's the different timescales."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "There's timescales of which we are like understanding my language and moving about and seeing things rapidly and over time, that's the timescales of activities of neurons."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "But if you wanna get in longer timescales, then it's more memory."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And we have to invoke those memories to say, oh yes, well now I can remember what I had for breakfast because I stored that someplace."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "I may forget it tomorrow, but I'd store it for now."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "So does memory also need to have, so the hierarchical aspect of reality is not just about concepts, it's also about time?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Do you think of it that way?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Yeah, time is infused in everything."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's like you really can't separate it out."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "If I ask you, what is your, you know, how's the brain learn a model of this coffee cup here?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "I have a coffee cup and I'm at the coffee cup."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I say, well, time is not an inherent property of the model I have of this cup, whether it's a visual model or a tactile model."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I can sense it through time, but the model itself doesn't really have much time."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "If I asked you, if I said, well, what is the model of my cell phone?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "My brain has learned a model of the cell phone."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "So if you have a smartphone like this, and I said, well, this has time aspects to it."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "I have expectations when I turn it on, what's gonna happen, what or how long it's gonna take to do certain things, if I bring up an app, what sequences, and so I have, and it's like melodies in the world, you know?"}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Melody has a sense of time."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So many things in the world move and act, and there's a sense of time related to them."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Some don't, but most things do actually."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So it's sort of infused throughout the models of the world."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "You build a model of the world, you're learning the structure of the objects in the world, and you're also learning how those things change through time."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Okay, so it really is just a fourth dimension that's infused deeply, and you have to make sure that your models of intelligence incorporate it."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So, like you mentioned, the state of neuroscience is deeply empirical, a lot of data collection."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It's, you know, that's where it is."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "You mentioned Thomas Kuhn, right?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you're proposing a theory of intelligence, and which is really the next step, the really important step to take, but why is HTM, or what we'll talk about soon, the right theory?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "So is it more in the, is it backed by intuition?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Is it backed by evidence?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Is it backed by a mixture of both?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Is it kind of closer to where string theory is in physics, where there's mathematical components which show that, you know what, it seems that this, it fits together too well for it not to be true, which is where string theory is."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Is that where you're kind of seeing?"}, {"time": 1289, "text": "It's a mixture of all those things, although definitely where we are right now is definitely much more on the empirical side than, let's say, string theory."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "The way this goes about, we're theorists, right?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So we look at all this data, and we're trying to come up with some sort of model that explains it, basically, and there's, unlike string theory, there's vast more amounts of empirical data here that I think than most physicists deal with."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And so our challenge is to sort through that and figure out what kind of constructs would explain this."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And when we have an idea, you come up with a theory of some sort, you have lots of ways of testing it."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "First of all, there are 100 years of assimilated, assimilated, unassimilated empirical data from neuroscience."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So we go back and read papers, and we say, oh, did someone find this already?"}, {"time": 1340, "text": "We can predict X, Y, and Z, and maybe no one's even talked about it since 1972 or something, but we go back and find that, and we say, oh, either it can support the theory or it can invalidate the theory."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And we say, okay, we have to start over again."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Oh, no, it's supportive, let's keep going with that one."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So the way I kind of view it, when we do our work, we look at all this empirical data, and what I call it is a set of constraints."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "We're not interested in something that's biologically inspired."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "We're trying to figure out how the actual brain works."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So every piece of empirical data is a constraint on a theory."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "In theory, if you have the correct theory, it needs to explain every pin, right?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So we have this huge number of constraints on the problem, which initially makes it very, very difficult."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "If you don't have many constraints, you can make up stuff all the day."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "You can say, oh, here's an answer on how you can do this, you can do that, you can do this."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But if you consider all biology as a set of constraints, all neuroscience as a set of constraints, and even if you're working in one little part of the neocortex, for example, there are hundreds and hundreds of constraints."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "These are empirical constraints that it's very, very difficult initially to come up with a theoretical framework for that."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "But when you do, and it solves all those constraints at once, you have a high confidence that you got something close to correct."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "It's just mathematically almost impossible not to be."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So that's the curse and the advantage of what we have."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "The curse is we have to solve, we have to meet all these constraints, which is really hard."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But when you do meet them, then you have a great confidence that you've discovered something."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "In addition, then we work with scientific labs."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So we'll say, oh, there's something we can't find, we can predict something, but we can't find it anywhere in the literature."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "So we will then, we have people we've collaborated with, we'll say, sometimes they'll say, you know what?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I have some collected data, which I didn't publish, but we can go back and look at it and see if we can find that, which is much easier than designing a new experiment."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "You know, neuroscience experiments take a long time, years."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So, although some people are doing that now too."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So, but between all of these things, I think it's a reasonable, actually a very, very good approach."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "We are blessed with the fact that we can test our theories out the yin yang here because there's so much unassimilar data and we can also falsify our theories very easily, which we do often."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "So it's kind of reminiscent to whenever that was with Copernicus, you know, when you figure out that the sun's at the center of the solar system as opposed to earth, the pieces just fall into place."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Yeah, I think that's the general nature of aha moments is, and it's Copernicus, it could be, you could say the same thing about Darwin, you could say the same thing about, you know, about the double helix, that people have been working on a problem for so long and have all this data and they can't make sense of it, they can't make sense of it."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "But when the answer comes to you and everything falls into place, it's like, oh my gosh, that's it."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "That's got to be right."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I asked both Jim Watson and Francis Crick about this."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "I asked them, you know, when you were working on trying to discover the structure of the double helix, and when you came up with the sort of the structure that ended up being correct, but it was sort of a guess, you know, it wasn't really verified yet."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I said, did you know that it was right?"}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And they both said, absolutely."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "So we absolutely knew it was right."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And it doesn't matter if other people didn't believe it or not, we knew it was right."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "They'd get around to thinking it and agree with it eventually anyway."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "And that's the kind of thing you hear a lot with scientists who really are studying a difficult problem."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And I feel that way too about our work."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Have you talked to Crick or Watson about the problem you're trying to solve, the, of finding the DNA of the brain?"}, {"time": 1575, "text": "Yeah, in fact, Francis Crick was very interested in this in the latter part of his life."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "And in fact, I got interested in brains by reading an essay he wrote in 1979 called Thinking About the Brain."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And that was when I decided I'm gonna leave my profession of computers and engineering and become a neuroscientist."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Just reading that one essay from Francis Crick."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "I got to meet him later in life."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "I spoke at the Salk Institute and he was in the audience."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And then I had a tea with him afterwards."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "He was interested in a different problem."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "He was focused on consciousness."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "The easy problem, right?"}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Well, I think it's the red herring."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And so we weren't really overlapping a lot there."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Jim Watson, who's still alive, is also interested in this problem."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And he was, when he was director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, he was really sort of behind moving in the direction of neuroscience there."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "And so he had a personal interest in this field."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And I have met with him numerous times."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And in fact, the last time was a little bit over a year ago, I gave a talk at Cold Spring Harbor Labs about the progress we were making in our work."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And it was a lot of fun because he said, well, you wouldn't be coming here unless you had something important to say."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "So I'm gonna go attend your talk."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "So he sat in the very front row."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Next to him was the director of the lab, Bruce Stillman."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So these guys are in the front row of this auditorium."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Nobody else in the auditorium wants to sit in the front row because there's Jim Watson and there's the director."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And I gave a talk and then I had dinner with him afterwards."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "But there's a great picture of my colleague Subitai Amantak where I'm up there sort of like screaming the basics of this new framework we have."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And Jim Watson's on the edge of his chair."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "He's literally on the edge of his chair, like intently staring up at the screen."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And when he discovered the structure of DNA, the first public talk he gave was at Cold Spring Harbor Labs."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And there's a picture, there's a famous picture of Jim Watson standing at the whiteboard with an overrated thing pointing at something, pointing at the double helix with his pointer."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And it actually looks a lot like the picture of me."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "So there was a sort of funny, there's Arian talking about the brain and there's Jim Watson staring intently at it."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And of course there with, whatever, 60 years earlier, he was standing pointing at the double helix."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "That's one of the great discoveries in all of, whatever, biology, science, all science and DNA."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "So it's funny that there's echoes of that in your presentation."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "Do you think, in terms of evolutionary timeline and history, the development of the neocortex was a big leap?"}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Or is it just a small step?"}, {"time": 1747, "text": "So like, if we ran the whole thing over again, from the birth of life on Earth, how likely would we develop the mechanism of the neocortex?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Okay, well those are two separate questions."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "One is, was it a big leap?"}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And one was how likely it is, okay?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "They're not necessarily related."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "Maybe correlated."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "Maybe correlated, maybe not."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "And we don't really have enough data to make a judgment about that."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "I would say definitely it was a big leap."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And I can tell you why."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "I don't think it was just another incremental step."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "I don't get that at the moment."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "I don't really have any idea how likely it is."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "If we look at evolution, we have one data point, which is Earth, right?"}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Life formed on Earth billions of years ago, whether it was introduced here or it created it here, or someone introduced it, we don't really know, but it was here early."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It took a long, long time to get to multicellular life."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And then for multicellular life, it took a long, long time to get the neocortex."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "And we've only had the neocortex for a few 100,000 years."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So that's like nothing, okay?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "So is it likely?"}, {"time": 1809, "text": "Well, it certainly isn't something that happened right away on Earth."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And there were multiple steps to get there."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So I would say it's probably not gonna be something that would happen instantaneously on other planets that might have life."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "It might take several billion years on average."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "Is it likely?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "I don't know, but you'd have to survive for several billion years to find out."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Is it a big leap?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Yeah, I think it is a qualitative difference in all other evolutionary steps."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "I can try to describe that if you'd like."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "Sure, in which way?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Yeah, I can tell you how."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "Pretty much, let's start with a little preface."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Many of the things that humans are able to do do not have obvious survival advantages precedent."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "We could create music, is that, is there a really survival advantage to that?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Maybe, maybe not."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "What about mathematics?"}, {"time": 1864, "text": "Is there a real survival advantage to mathematics?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Well, you could stretch it."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "You can try to figure these things out, right?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "But most of evolutionary history, everything had immediate survival advantages to it."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So, I'll tell you a story, which I like, may or may not be true, but the story goes as follows."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Organisms have been evolving for, since the beginning of life here on Earth, and adding this sort of complexity onto that, and this sort of complexity onto that, and the brain itself is evolved this way."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "In fact, there's old parts, and older parts, and older, older parts of the brain that kind of just keeps calming on new things, and we keep adding capabilities."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "When we got to the neocortex, initially it had a very clear survival advantage in that it produced better vision, and better hearing, and better touch, and maybe, and so on."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "But what I think happens is that evolution discovered, it took a mechanism, and this is in our recent theories, but it took a mechanism evolved a long time ago for navigating in the world, for knowing where you are."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "These are the so called grid cells and place cells of an old part of the brain."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And it took that mechanism for building maps of the world, and knowing where you are on those maps, and how to navigate those maps, and turns it into a sort of a slimmed down, idealized version of it."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And that idealized version could now apply to building maps of other things."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "Maps of coffee cups, and maps of phones, maps of mathematics."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Concepts almost."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Concepts, yes, and not just almost, exactly."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "And so, and it just started replicating this stuff, right?"}, {"time": 1964, "text": "You just think more, and more, and more."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So we went from being sort of dedicated purpose neural hardware to solve certain problems that are important to survival, to a general purpose neural hardware that could be applied to all problems."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And now it's escaped the orbit of survival."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "We are now able to apply it to things which we find enjoyment, but aren't really clearly survival characteristics."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "And that it seems to only have happened in humans, to the large extent."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And so that's what's going on, where we sort of have, we've sort of escaped the gravity of evolutionary pressure, in some sense, in the neocortex."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And it now does things which are not, that are really interesting, discovering models of the universe, which may not really help us."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Does it matter?"}, {"time": 2017, "text": "How does it help us surviving, knowing that there might be multiverses, or that there might be the age of the universe, or how do various stellar things occur?"}, {"time": 2026, "text": "It doesn't really help us survive at all."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "But we enjoy it, and that's what happened."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "Or at least not in the obvious way, perhaps."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "It is required, if you look at the entire universe in an evolutionary way, it's required for us to do interplanetary travel, and therefore survive past our own sun."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "But you know, let's not get too."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Yeah, but evolution works at one time frame, it's survival, if you think of survival of the phenotype, survival of the individual."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "What you're talking about there is spans well beyond that."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So there's no genetic, I'm not transferring any genetic traits to my children that are gonna help them survive better on Mars."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "Totally different mechanism, that's right."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So let's get into the new, as you've mentioned, this idea of the, I don't know if you have a nice name, thousand."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "We call it the thousand brain theory of intelligence."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "I like it."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "Can you talk about this idea of a spatial view of concepts and so on?"}, {"time": 2084, "text": "Yeah, so can I just describe sort of the, there's an underlying core discovery, which then everything comes from that."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "That's a very simple, this is really what happened."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "We were deep into problems about understanding how we build models of stuff in the world and how we make predictions about things."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And I was holding a coffee cup just like this in my hand."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "And my finger was touching the side, my index finger."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "And then I moved it to the top and I was gonna feel the rim at the top of the cup."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And I asked myself a very simple question."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "I said, well, first of all, I say, I know that my brain predicts what it's gonna feel before it touches it."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "You can just think about it and imagine it."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And so we know that the brain's making predictions all the time."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So the question is, what does it take to predict that?"}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And there's a very interesting answer."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "First of all, it says the brain has to know it's touching a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It has to have a model of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "It needs to know where the finger currently is on the cup relative to the cup."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Because when I make a movement, it needs to know where it's going to be on the cup after the movement is completed relative to the cup."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "And then it can make a prediction about what it's gonna sense."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So this told me that the neocortex, which is making this prediction, needs to know that it's sensing it's touching a cup."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And it needs to know the location of my finger relative to that cup in a reference frame of the cup."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "It doesn't matter where the cup is relative to my body."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "It doesn't matter its orientation."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "None of that matters."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "It's where my finger is relative to the cup, which tells me then that the neocortex has a reference frame that's anchored to the cup."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Because otherwise I wouldn't be able to say the location and I wouldn't be able to predict my new location."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And then we quickly, very instantly can say, well, every part of my skin could touch this cup."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And therefore every part of my skin is making predictions and every part of my skin must have a reference frame that it's using to make predictions."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "So the big idea is that throughout the neocortex, there are, everything is being stored and referenced in reference frames."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "You can think of them like XYZ reference frames, but they're not like that."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "We know a lot about the neural mechanisms for this, but the brain thinks in reference frames."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "And as an engineer, if you're an engineer, this is not surprising."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "You'd say, if I wanted to build a CAD model of the coffee cup, well, I would bring it up and some CAD software, and I would assign some reference frame and say this features at this locations and so on."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "But the fact that this, the idea that this is occurring throughout the neocortex everywhere, it was a novel idea."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "And then a zillion things fell into place after that, a zillion."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "So now we think about the neocortex as processing information quite differently than we used to do it."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "We used to think about the neocortex as processing sensory data and extracting features from that sensory data and then extracting features from the features, very much like a deep learning network does today."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "But that's not how the brain works at all."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "The brain works by assigning everything, every input, everything to reference frames."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of them active at once in your neocortex."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "It's a surprising thing to think about, but once you sort of internalize this, you understand that it explains almost every, almost all the mysteries we've had about this structure."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So one of the consequences of that is that every small part of the neocortex, say a millimeter square, and there's 150,000 of those."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So it's about 150,000 square millimeters."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "If you take every little square millimeter of the cortex, it's got some input coming into it and it's gonna have reference frames where it's assigned that input to."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And each square millimeter can learn complete models of objects."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "So what do I mean by that?"}, {"time": 2302, "text": "If I'm touching the coffee cup, well, if I just touch it in one place, I can't learn what this coffee cup is because I'm just feeling one part."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "But if I move it around the cup and touch it at different areas, I can build up a complete model of the cup because I'm now filling in that three dimensional map, which is the coffee cup."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "I can say, oh, what am I feeling at all these different locations?"}, {"time": 2319, "text": "That's the basic idea, it's more complicated than that."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "But so through time, and we talked about time earlier, through time, even a single column, which is only looking at, or a single part of the cortex, which is only looking at a small part of the world, can build up a complete model of an object."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And so if you think about the part of the brain, which is getting input from all my fingers, so they're spread across the top of your head here."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "This is the somatosensory cortex."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "There's columns associated with all the different areas of my skin."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "And what we believe is happening is that all of them are building models of this cup, every one of them, or things."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "They're not all building, not every column or every part of the cortex builds models of everything, but they're all building models of something."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "And so you have, so when I touch this cup with my hand, there are multiple models of the cup being invoked."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "If I look at it with my eyes, there are, again, many models of the cup being invoked, because each part of the visual system, the brain doesn't process an image."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "That's a misleading idea."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It's just like your fingers touching the cup, so different parts of my retina are looking at different parts of the cup."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "And thousands and thousands of models of the cup are being invoked at once."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And they're all voting with each other, trying to figure out what's going on."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "So that's why we call it the thousand brains theory of intelligence, because there isn't one model of a cup."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "There are thousands of models of this cup."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "There are thousands of models of your cellphone and about cameras and microphones and so on."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It's a distributed modeling system, which is very different than the way people have thought about it."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "And so that's a really compelling and interesting idea."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "I have two first questions."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "So one, on the ensemble part of everything coming together, you have these thousand brains."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "How do you know which one has done the best job of forming the... Great question."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Let me try to explain it."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "There's a problem that's known in neuroscience called the sensor fusion problem."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "And so the idea is there's something like, oh, the image comes from the eye."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "There's a picture on the retina and then it gets projected to the neocortex."},

picture anymore."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "When does it all come back together again?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Or you might say, well, yes, but I also have sounds or touches associated with the cup."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So I'm seeing the cup and touching the cup."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "How do they get combined together again?"}, {"time": 2452, "text": "So it's called the sensor fusion problem."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "As if all these disparate parts have to be brought together into one model someplace."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "That's the wrong idea."}, {"time": 2461,

the size of a little piece of spaghetti."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Like a two and a half millimeters tall and about a millimeter in wide."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "They're not physical, but you could think of them that way."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And each one's trying to guess what this thing is or touching."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Now, they can do a pretty good job if they're allowed to move over time."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "So I can reach my hand into a black box and move my finger around an object."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "And if I touch enough spaces, I go, okay, now I know what it is."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "But often we don't do that."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "Often I can just reach and grab something with my hand all at once and I get it."}, {"time": 2511,

"text": "But if I open my eyes, I see the whole thing at once."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So what we think is going on is all these little pieces of spaghetti, if you will, all these little columns in the cortex, are all trying to guess what it is that they're sensing."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "They'll do a better guess if they have time and can move over time."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "So if I move my eyes, I move my fingers."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "But if they don't, they have a poor guess."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "It's a probabilistic guess of what they might be touching."}, {"time":

distribution."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "It's more like a set of possibilities."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "In the brain, it doesn't work as a probability distribution."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "It works as more like what we call a union."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "So you could say, and one column says, I think it could be a coffee cup, a soda can, or a water bottle."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And another column says, I think it could be a coffee cup or a telephone or a camera or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And all these guys are saying what they think it might be."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And there's these long range connections in certain layers in the cortex."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "So there's in some layers in some cells types in each column, send the projections across the brain."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "And that's the voting occurs."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And so there's a simple associative memory mechanism."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "We've described this in a recent paper and we've modeled this that says, they can all quickly settle on the only or the one best answer for all of them."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "If there is a single best answer, they all vote and say, yep, it's gotta be the coffee cup."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And at that point, they all know it's a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And at that point, everyone acts as if it's a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "They're like, yep, we know it's a coffee, even though I've only seen one little piece of this world, I know it's a coffee cup I'm touching or I'm seeing or whatever."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And so you can think of all these columns are looking at different parts in different places, different sensory input, different locations, they're all different."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "But this layer that's doing the voting, it solidifies."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "It's just like it crystallizes and says, oh, we all know what we're doing."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "And so you don't bring these models together in one model, you just vote and there's a crystallization of the vote."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Great, that's at least a compelling way to think about the way you form a model of the world."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "Now, you talk about a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "Do you see this, as far as I understand, you are proposing this as well, that this extends to much more than coffee cups?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Or at least the physical world, it expands to the world of concepts."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And well, first, the primary thing is evidence for that is that the regions of the neocortex that are associated with language or high level thought or mathematics or things like that, they look like the regions of the neocortex that process vision, hearing, and touch."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "They don't look any different."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Or they look only marginally different."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "And so one would say, well, if Vernon Mountcastle, who proposed that all the parts of the neocortex do the same thing, if he's right, then the parts that are doing language or mathematics or physics are working on the same principle."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "They must be working on the principle of reference frames."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So that's a little odd thought."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "But of course, we had no prior idea how these things happen."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "So let's go with that."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "And we, in our recent paper, we talked a little bit about that."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "I've been working on it more since."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "I have better ideas about it now."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "I'm sitting here very confident that that's what's happening."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And I can give you some examples that help you think about that."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "It's not we understand it completely, but I understand it better than I've described it in any paper so far."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So, but we did put that idea out there."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "It says, okay, this is, it's a good place to start, you know?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "And the evidence would suggest it's how it's happening."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "And then we can start tackling that problem one piece at a time."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "Like, what does it mean to do high level thought?"}, {"time": 2729, "text": "What does it mean to do language?"}, {"time": 2730, "text": "How would that fit into a reference frame framework?"}, {"time": 2734, "text": "Yeah, so there's a, I don't know if you could tell me if there's a connection, but there's an app called Anki that helps you remember different concepts."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "And they talk about like a memory palace that helps you remember completely random concepts by trying to put them in a physical space in your mind and putting them next to each other."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "It's called the method of loci."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "Loci, yeah."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "For some reason, that seems to work really well."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Now, that's a very narrow kind of application of just remembering some facts."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "But that's a very, very telling one."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "So this seems like you're describing a mechanism why this seems to work."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So basically the way what we think is going on is all things you know, all concepts, all ideas, words, everything you know are stored in reference frames."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And so if you want to remember something, you have to basically navigate through a reference frame the same way a rat navigates through a maze and the same way my finger navigates to this coffee cup."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "You are moving through some space."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And so if you have a random list of things you were asked to remember, by assigning them to a reference frame, you've already know very well to see your house, right?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And the idea of the method of loci is you can say, okay, in my lobby, I'm going to put this thing."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And then the bedroom, I put this one."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "I go down the hall, I put this thing."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And then you want to recall those facts or recall those things."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "You just walk mentally, you walk through your house."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "You're mentally moving through a reference frame that you already had."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "And that tells you, there's two things that are really important about that."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "It tells us the brain prefers to store things in reference frames."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And that the method of recalling things or thinking, if you will, is to move mentally through those reference frames."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "You could move physically through some reference frames, like I could physically move through the reference frame of this coffee cup."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "I can also mentally move through the reference frame of the coffee cup, imagining me touching it."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "But I can also mentally move my house."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And so now we can ask yourself, or are all concepts stored this way?"}, {"time": 2846, "text": "There was some recent research using human subjects in fMRI, and I'm going to apologize for not knowing the name of the scientists who did this."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "But what they did is they put humans in this fMRI machine, which is one of these imaging machines."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And they gave the humans tasks to think about birds."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So they had different types of birds, and birds that look big and small, and long necks and long legs, things like that."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And what they could tell from the fMRI was a very clever experiment."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "You get to tell when humans were thinking about the birds, that the birds, the knowledge of birds was arranged in a reference frame, similar to the ones that are used when you navigate in a room."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "That these are called grid cells, and there are grid cell like patterns of activity in the neocortex when they do this."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "So it's a very clever experiment."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And what it basically says, that even when you're thinking about something abstract, and you're not really thinking about it as a reference frame, it tells us the brain is actually using a reference frame."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "And it's using the same neural mechanisms."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "These grid cells are the basic same neural mechanism that we propose that grid cells, which exist in the old part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, that that mechanism is now similar mechanism is used throughout the neocortex."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "It's the same nature to preserve this interesting way of creating reference frames."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And so now they have empirical evidence that when you think about concepts like birds, that you're using reference frames that are built on grid cells."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So that's similar to the method of loci, but in this case, the birds are related."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So they create their own reference frame, which is consistent with bird space."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "And when you think about something, you go through that."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "You can make the same example, let's take mathematics."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "Let's say you wanna prove a conjecture."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "What is a conjecture?"}, {"time": 2950, "text": "A conjecture is a statement you believe to be true, but you haven't proven it."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And so it might be an equation."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "I wanna show that this is equal to that."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "And you have some places you start with."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "You say, well, I know this is true, and I know this is true."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "And I think that maybe to get to the final proof, I need to go through some intermediate results."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "What I believe is happening is literally these equations or these points are assigned to a reference frame, a mathematical reference frame."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "And when you do mathematical operations, a simple one might be multiply or divide, but you might be a little plus transform or something else."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "That is like a movement in the reference frame of the math."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And so you're literally trying to discover a path from one location to another location in a space of mathematics."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And if you can get to these intermediate results, then you know your map is pretty good, and you know you're using the right operations."}, {"time": 3002,

that space to get me there."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "Yeah, so if you dig in an idea of this reference frame, whether it's the math, you start a set of axioms to try to get to proving the conjecture."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Can you try to describe, maybe take a step back, how you think of the reference frame in that context?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "Is it the reference frame that the axioms are happy in?"}, {"time": 3036, "text": "Is it the reference frame that might contain everything?"}, {"time": 3038, "text": "Is it a changing thing as you?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "You have many, many reference frames."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I mean, in fact, the way the theory, the thousand brain theory of intelligence says that every single thing in the world has its own reference frame."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So every word has its own reference frames."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "And we can talk about this."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "The mathematics work out, this is no problem for neurons to do this."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "But how many reference frames does a coffee cup have?"}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Well, it's on a table."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "Let's say you ask how many reference frames could a column in my finger that's touching the coffee cup have?"}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Because there are many, many copy, there are many, many models of the coffee cup."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "So the coffee, there is no one model of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "There are many models of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "And you could say, well, how many different things can my finger learn?"}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Is this the question you want to ask?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Imagine I say every concept, every idea,

a handle."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "And those things have their own reference frames and they're assigned to a master reference frame, which is called this cup."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And now I

its own reference frame."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So we now have to say, how can I assign the Numenta logo reference frame onto the cylinder or onto the coffee cup?"}, {"time": 3119, "text": "So it's all, we talked about this in the paper that came out in December of this last year."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "The idea of how you can assign reference frames to reference frames, how neurons could do this."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "So, well, my question is, even though you mentioned reference frames a lot, I almost feel it's really useful to dig into how you think of what a reference frame is."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "I mean, it was already helpful for me to understand that you think of reference frames as something there is a lot of."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "Okay, so let's just say that we're gonna have some neurons in the brain, not many, actually, 10,000, 20,000 are gonna create a whole bunch of reference frames."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "What does it mean?"},

reference frame."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "It's kind of a Cartesian coordinate reference frame."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "The interesting thing about the reference frames in the brain, and we know this because these have been established through neuroscience studying the entorhinal cortex."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "So I'm not speculating here, okay?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "This is known neuroscience in an old part of the brain."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "The way these cells create reference frames, they have no origin."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So what it's more like, you have a point, a point in some space, and you, given a particular movement, you can then tell what the next point should be."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "And you can then tell what the next point would be, and so on."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "You can use this to calculate how to get from one point to another."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "So how do I get from my house to my home, or how do I get my finger from the side of my cup to the top of the cup?"}, {"time": 3226, "text": "How do I get from the axioms to the conjecture?"}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So it's a different type of reference frame, and I can, if you want, I can describe in more detail, I can paint a picture of how you might want to think about that."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "It's really helpful to think it's something you can move

spatial in a mathematical sense."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "How many dimensions?"}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Can it be a crazy number of dimensions?"}, {"time": 3256, "text": "Well, that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "In the old part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, they studied rats, and initially it looks like, oh, this is just two dimensional."}, {"time":

3279, "text": "They seem to know where they are, right?"}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So this is a current area of active research, and it seems like somehow the neurons in the entorhinal cortex can

had a bunch of two dimensional slices."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "That's the way these things work."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "There's a whole bunch of two dimensional models, and you can just, you can slice up any n dimensional space with two dimensional projections."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "So, and you could have one dimensional models."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "So there's nothing inherent about the mathematics about the way the neurons do this, which constrain the dimensionality of the space, which I think was important."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So obviously I have a three dimensional map of this cup."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "Maybe it's even more than that, I don't know."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "But it's clearly a three dimensional map of the cup."}, {"time": 3348,

concept."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "This is a totally new way of thinking about how the neocortex works."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "So that is appealing."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "It has all these

we're trying to work through many of these details right now."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "Okay, how do the neurons actually do this?"}, {"time": 3400, "text": "Well, it turns out, if you think about grid cells and place cells in the old parts of the brain, there's a lot that's known about them, but there's still some mysteries."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "There's a lot of debate about exactly the details, how these work and what are the signs."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "And we have that still, that same level of detail, that same level of concern."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "What we spend here most of our time doing is trying to make a very good list of the things we don't understand yet."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "That's the key part here."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "What are the constraints?"}, {"time": 3425, "text": "It's not like, oh, this thing seems to work, we're done."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "No, it's like, okay, it kind of works, but these are other things we know it

trickiness to this system, but the basic principles about how different layers in the neocortex are doing much of this, we understand."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "But there's some fundamental parts that we don't understand as well."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "So what would you say is one of the harder open problems or one of the ones that have been bothering you, keeping you up at night the most?"}, {"time": 3458, "text": "Oh, well, right now, this is a detailed thing that wouldn't apply to most people, okay?"}, {"time": 3463, "text": "But you want me to answer that question?"}, {"time": 3466, "text": "We've talked about as if, oh, to predict what you're going to sense on this coffee cup, I need to know where my finger is gonna be on the coffee cup."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "That is true, but it's insufficient."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Think about my finger touches the edge of the coffee cup."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "My finger can touch it at different orientations."},

cells, which way the rat is facing."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "It's the same kind of basic idea."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "So if my finger were a rat, you know, in three dimensions, I have a three dimensional orientation and I have a three dimensional location."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "If I was a rat, I would have a, you might think of it as a two dimensional location, a two dimensional orientation, a one dimensional orientation, like just which way is it facing?"}, {"time": 3515, "text": "So how the two components work together, how it is that I combine orientation, the orientation of my sensor, as well as the location is a tricky problem."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "And I think I've made progress on it."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "So at a bigger version of that, so perspective is super interesting, but super specific."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "Yeah, I warned you."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "No, no, no, that's really good, but there's a more general version of that."}, {"time":

it does."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "Maybe what we think of that as a coffee cup in another part of the world is viewed as something completely different."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "Or maybe our logo,

the way to think about it is the following, one way to think about it, is we have all these models of the world, okay?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And we model everything."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "And as I said earlier, I kind of snuck it in there, our models are actually, we build composite structure."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "So every object is composed of other objects, which are composed of other objects, and they become members of other objects."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "So this room has chairs and a table and a room and walls and so on."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "Now we can just arrange these things in a certain way and go, oh, that's the nomenclature conference room."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "So, and what we do is when we go around the world and we experience the world, by walking into a room, for example, the first thing I do is I can say, oh, I'm in this room, do I recognize the room?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Then I can say, oh, look, there's a table here."},

letter E.

the reference frame information for that particular period of time?"}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Yes, it basically, moment to moment, you attend the sub components, and then you can attend the sub components to sub components."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And you can move up and down."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "You can move up and down."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "We do that all the time."},

like my personal day?"}, {"time": 3715, "text": "Unfortunately, I'm afflicted with too much of the former."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "Well, unfortunately or unfortunately."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "You don't think it's useful?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "Oh, it is useful, totally useful."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "I think about this stuff almost all the time."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "And one of my primary ways of thinking is when I'm in sleep at night, I always wake up in the middle of the night."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And then I stay awake for at least an hour with my eyes shut in sort of a half sleep state thinking about these things."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "I come up with answers to problems very often in that sort of half sleeping state."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "I think about it on my bike ride, I think about it on walks."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "I'm just constantly thinking about this."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "I have to almost schedule time to not think about this stuff because it's very, it's mentally taxing."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "Are you, when you're thinking about this stuff, are you thinking introspectively, like almost taking a step outside of yourself and trying to figure out what is your mind doing right now?"}, {"time": 3765, "text": "I do that all the time, but that's not all I do."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "I'm constantly observing myself."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "So as soon as I started thinking about grid cells, for example, and getting into that, I started saying, oh, well, grid cells can have my place of sense in the world."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "That's where you know where you are."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "And it's interesting, we always have a sense of where we are unless we're lost."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "And so I started at night when I got up to go to the bathroom, I would start trying to do it completely with my eyes closed all the time."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And I would test my sense of grid cells."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "I would walk five feet and say, okay, I think I'm here."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "Am I really there?"}, {"time": 3794, "text": "What's my error?"}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And then I would calculate my error again and see how the errors could accumulate."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "So even something as simple as getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I'm testing these theories out."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "It's kind of fun."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "I mean, the coffee cup is an example of that too."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "So I find that these sort of everyday introspections are actually quite helpful."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "It doesn't mean you can ignore the science."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "I mean, I spend hours every day reading ridiculously complex papers."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "That's not nearly as much fun, but you have to sort of build up those constraints and the knowledge about the field and who's doing what and what exactly they think is happening here."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "And then you can sit back and say, okay, let's try to piece this all together."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "Let's come up with some, I'm very, in this group here, people, they know they do, I do this all the time."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "I come in with these introspective ideas and say, well, have you ever thought about this?"}, {"time": 3842, "text": "Now watch, well, let's all do this together."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "And it's helpful."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "It's not, as long as you don't, all you did was that, then you're just making up stuff."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "But if you're constraining it by the reality of the neuroscience, then it's really helpful."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "So let's talk a little bit about deep learning and the successes in the applied space of neural networks, ideas of training model on data and these simple computational units, artificial neurons that with backpropagation, statistical ways of being able to generalize from the training set onto data that's similar to that training set."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So where do you think are the limitations of those approaches?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "What do you think are its strengths relative to your major efforts of constructing a theory of human intelligence?"}, {"time": 3896, "text":

intuition."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "What are your?"}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Well, I have a little bit more than intuition, but I just want to say like, you know, one of the things that you asked me, do I spend all my time thinking about neuroscience?"}, {"time": 3910, "text": "That's to the exclusion of thinking about things like convolutional neural networks."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "But I try to stay current."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "So look, I think it's great, the progress they've made."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "And as I mentioned earlier, it's very highly useful for many things."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "The models that we have today are actually derived from a lot of neuroscience principles."}, {"time": 3928, "text": "There are distributed processing systems and distributed memory systems, and that's how the brain works."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "They use things that we might call them neurons, but they're really not neurons at all."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "So we can just, they're not really neurons."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So they're distributed processing systems."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "And that nature of hierarchy, that came also from neuroscience."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And so there's a lot of things, the learning rules, basically, not back prop, but other, you know, sort of heavy on top of that."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "I'd be curious to say they're not neurons at all."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Can you describe in which way?"}, {"time": 3956, "text": "I mean, some of it is obvious, but I'd be curious if you have specific ways in which you think are the biggest differences."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Yeah, we had a paper in 2016 called Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "And if you read that paper, you'll know what I'm talking about here."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "A real neuron in the brain is a complex thing."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "And let's just start with the synapses on it, which is a connection between neurons."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Real neurons can have everywhere from five to 30,000 synapses on them."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "The ones near the cell body, the ones that are close to the soma of the cell body, those are like the ones that people model in artificial neurons."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "There is a few hundred of those."},

"text": "They're too far away."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "So if you activate one of those synapses, it just doesn't affect the cell body enough to make any difference."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "Any one of them individually."}, {"time": 4010, "text": "Any one of them individually, or even if you do a mass of them."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "What real neurons do is the following."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "If you activate or you get 10 to 20 of them active at the same time, meaning they're all receiving an input at the same time, and those 10 to 20 synapses or 40 synapses within a very short distance on the dendrite, like 40 microns, a very small area."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So if you activate a bunch of these right next to each other at some distant place, what happens is it creates what's called the dendritic spike."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "And the dendritic spike travels through the dendrites and can reach the soma or the cell body."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "Now, when it gets there, it changes the voltage, which is sort of like gonna make the cell fire, but never enough to make the cell fire."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "It's sort of what we call, it says we depolarize the cell, you raise the voltage a little bit, but not enough to do anything."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "It's like, well, what good is that?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "And then it goes back down again."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "So we propose a theory, which I'm very confident in basics are, is that what's happening there is those 95% of the synapses are recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique patterns."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "They can write about 10, 20 synapses at a time, and they're acting like predictions."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "So the neuron actually is a predictive engine on its own."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "It can fire when it gets enough, what they call proximal input from those ones near the cell fire, but it can get ready to fire from dozens to hundreds of patterns that it recognizes from the other guys."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And the advantage of this to the neuron is that when it actually does produce a spike in action potential, it does so slightly sooner than it would have otherwise."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "And so what could is slightly sooner?"}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Well, the slightly sooner part is it, all the excitatory neurons in the brain are surrounded by these inhibitory neurons, and they're very fast, the inhibitory neurons, these basket cells."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "And if I get my spike out a little bit sooner than someone else, I inhibit all my neighbors around me, right?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "And what you end up with is a different representation."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "You end up with a reputation that matches your prediction."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "It's a sparser representation, meaning fewer neurons are active, but it's much more specific."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And so we showed how networks of these neurons can do very sophisticated temporal prediction, basically."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "So this, summarize this, real neurons in the brain are time based prediction engines, and there's no concept of this at all in artificial, what we call point neurons."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "I don't think you can build a brain without them."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "I don't think you can build intelligence without them, because it's where a large part of the time comes from."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "These are predictive models, and the time is, there's a prior

at that either."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "But like for example, synapses are very unreliable, and you cannot assign any precision to them."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So even one digit of precision is not possible."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "So the way real neurons work is they don't add these, they don't change these weights accurately like artificial neural networks do."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "They basically form new synapses, and so what you're trying to always do is detect the presence of some 10 to 20 active synapses at the same time, as opposed, and they're almost binary."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "It's like, because you can't really represent anything much finer than that."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "So these are the kind of, and I think that's actually another essential component, because the brain works on sparse patterns, and all that mechanism is based on sparse patterns, and I don't actually think you could build real brains or machine intelligence without incorporating some of those ideas."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "It's hard to even think about the complexity that emerges from the fact that the timing of the firing matters in the brain, the fact that

4247, "text": "It's not like, it's no longer a mystery to me."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "No, but sorry, as a function, in a mathematical way, can you start getting an intuition about what gets it excited, what not, and what kind of representation?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Yeah, it's not as easy as, there's many other types of neural networks that are more amenable to pure analysis, especially very simple networks."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "Oh, I have four neurons, and they're doing this."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "Can we describe to them mathematically what they're doing type of thing?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "Even the complexity of convolutional neural networks today, it's sort of a mystery."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "They can't really describe the whole system."},

if you're interested, talking about sort of the mathematical properties of sparse representations."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And so what we can do is we can show mathematically, for example, why 10 to 20 synapses to recognize a pattern is the correct number, is the right number you'd wanna use."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And by the way, that matches biology."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "We can show mathematically some of these concepts about the show why the brain is so robust to noise and error and fallout and so on."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "We can show that mathematically as well as empirically in simulations."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "But the system can't be analyzed completely."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Any complex system can't, and so that's out of the realm."}, {"time":

papers have a section about that."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So I think it's refreshing and useful for me to be talking to you about deep neural networks, because your intuition basically says that we can't achieve anything like intelligence with artificial neural networks."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Well, not in the current form."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "Not in the current form."}, {"time":

it actually."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Is he saying that as a criticism or is he saying this is a prescription of what we ought to be doing?"}, {"time": 4434, "text": "Well, it's very difficult."},

do."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "He's part of the community."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "He's saying it's only going to be short term gains."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So this all leads up to a question,

know the brain can do and that we think about as intelligence by just scaling it up."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "So that may be, it's a good description of what's happened in the past, what's happened

4546, "text": "So this is now, I wouldn't say our focus, but it is now an equal focus here because we need to proselytize what we've learned and we need to show how it's beneficial to the machine

can tell you about that."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "But one of the reasons I wanna talk to you is because I'm trying to get more people in the machine learning community to say, I need to learn about this stuff."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "And maybe we should just think about this a bit more about what we've learned about the brain and what are those team at Nimenta, what have they done?"},

term?"}, {"time": 4591, "text": "Yes, in the short term, yes."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "This is the, sorry to interrupt, but the open question is, it certainly feels from my perspective that in the

what I would call the entrepreneur's dilemma."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "So you have this long term vision, oh, we're gonna all be driving electric cars or we're all gonna have computers or we're all

4725, "text": "So what Sibutai and Louise, one of our other engineers here have done, have shown they're introducing sparseness into convolutional neural networks."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "Now other people are thinking along these lines, but we're going about it in a more principled way, I think."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "And we're showing that if you enforce sparseness throughout these convolutional neural networks in both the act, which sort of, which neurons are active and the connections between them, that you get some very desirable properties."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "So one of the current hot topics in deep learning right now are these adversarial examples."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So, you know, you give me any deep learning network and I can give you a picture that looks perfect and you're going to call it, you know, you're going to say the monkey is, you know, an airplane."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "So that's a problem."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "And DARPA just announced some big thing."}, {"time": 4774, "text": "They're trying to, you know, have some contest for this."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "But if you enforce sparse representations here, many of these problems go away."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "They're much more robust and they're not easy to fool."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "So we've already shown some of those results, just literally in January or February, just like last month we did that."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "And you can, I think it's on bioRxiv right now, or on iRxiv, you can read about it."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "But, so that's like a baby step, okay?"}, {"time": 4803, "text": "That's taking something from the brain."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "We know about sparseness."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "We know why it's important."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "We know what it gives the brain."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "So let's try to enforce that onto this."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "What's your intuition why sparsity leads to robustness?"}, {"time": 4812, "text": "Because it feels like it would be less robust."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Why would you feel the rest robust to you?"}, {"time": 4817, "text": "So it just feels like if the fewer neurons are involved, the more fragile the representation."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "But I didn't say there was lots of few neurons."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "I said, let's say 200."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "That's a lot."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "There's still a lot, it's just."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "So here's an intuition for it."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "This is a bit technical, so for engineers, machine learning people, this will be easy, but all the listeners, maybe not."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "If you're trying to classify something, you're trying to divide some very high dimensional space into different pieces, A and B."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "And you're trying to create some point where you say, all these points in this high dimensional space are A, and all these points in this high dimensional space are B."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "And if you have points that are close to that line, it's not very robust."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "It works for all the points you know about, but it's not very robust, because you can just move a little bit and you've crossed over the line."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "When you have sparse representations, imagine I pick, I'm gonna pick 200 cells active out of 10,000, okay?"}, {"time": 4879, "text": "So I have 200 cells active."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "Now let's say I pick randomly another, a different representation, 200."}, {"time": 4884, "text": "The overlap between those is gonna be very small, just a few."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "I can pick millions of samples randomly of 200 neurons, and not one of them will overlap more than just a few."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "So one way to think about it is, if I wanna fool one of these representations to look like one of those other representations, I can't move just one cell, or two cells, or three cells, or four cells."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "I have to move 100 cells."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "And that makes them robust."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "In terms of further, so you mentioned sparsity."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "What would be the next thing?"}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Okay, so we have, we picked one."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "We don't know if it's gonna work well yet."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "So again, we're trying to come up with incremental ways to moving from brain theory to add pieces to machine learning, current machine learning world, and one step at a time."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "So the next thing we're gonna try to do is sort of incorporate some of the ideas of the thousand brains theory, that you have many, many models that are voting."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Now that idea is not new."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "There's a mixture of models that's been around for a long time."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "But the way the brain does it is a little different."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And the way it votes is different."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And the kind of way it represents uncertainty is different."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "So we're just starting this work, but we're gonna try to see if we can sort of incorporate some of the principles of voting, or principles of the thousand brain theory."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Like lots of simple models that talk to each other in a certain way."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "And can we build more machines, systems that learn faster and also, well mostly are multimodal and robust to multimodal type of issues."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "So one of the challenges there is the machine learning computer vision community has certain sets of benchmarks, sets of tests based on which they compete."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "And I would argue, especially from your perspective, that those benchmarks aren't that useful for testing the aspects that the brain is good at, or intelligence."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "They're not really testing intelligence."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "They're very fine."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "And it's been extremely useful for developing specific mathematical models, but it's not useful in the long term for creating intelligence."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So you think you also have a role in proposing better tests?"}, {"time": 5027, "text": "Yeah, this is a very, you've identified a very serious problem."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "First of all, the tests that they have are the tests that they want."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Not the tests of the other things that we're trying to do, right?"}, {"time": 5038, "text": "You know, what are the, so on."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "The second thing is sometimes these, to be competitive in these tests, you have to have huge data sets and huge computing power."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "And so, you know, and we don't have that here."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "We don't have it as well as other big teams that big companies do."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "So there's numerous issues there."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "You know, we come out, you know, where our approach to this is all based on, in some sense, you might argue, elegance."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "We're coming at it from like a theoretical base that we think, oh my God, this is so clearly elegant."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "This is how brains work."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "This is what intelligence is."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "But the machine learning world has gotten in this phase where they think it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "Doesn't matter what you think, as long as you do, you know, 0.1% better on this benchmark, that's what, that's all that matters."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "And that's a problem."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "You know, we have to figure out how to get around that."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "That's a challenge for us."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "That's one of the challenges that we have to deal with."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So I agree, you've identified a big issue."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "It's difficult for those reasons."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "But you know, part of the reasons I'm talking to you here today is I hope I'm gonna get some machine learning people to say, I'm gonna read those papers."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "Those might be some interesting ideas."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "I'm tired of doing this 0.1% improvement stuff, you know?"}, {"time": 5108, "text": "Well, that's why I'm here as well, because I think machine learning now as a community is at a place where the next step needs to be orthogonal to what has received success in the past."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Well, you see other leaders saying this, machine learning leaders, you know, Jeff Hinton with his capsules idea."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "Many people have gotten up to say, you know, we're gonna hit road map, maybe we should look at the brain, you know, things like that."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "So hopefully that thinking will occur organically."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And then we're in a nice position for people to come and look at our work and say, well, what can we learn from these guys?"}, {"time": 5143, "text": "Yeah, MIT is launching a billion dollar computing college that's centered around this idea, so."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "Is it on this idea of what?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "Well, the idea that, you know, the humanities,

Let's study what a brain does."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Does."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "And then we can decide which parts of that we wanna recreate in some system, but until you have that theory about what the brain does, what's the point, you know, it's just, you're gonna be wasting time, I think."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Right, just to break it down on the artificial neural network side,

difference between, you know, in artificial neural networks, there's a difference between the learning stage and the inference stage."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "Do you see the brain as something different?"}, {"time": 5244, "text": "One of the big distinctions that people often say, I don't know how correct it is, is artificial neural networks need a lot of data."}, {"time": 5252, "text":

elements do you think are useful?"}, {"time": 5270, "text": "Yeah, I can talk about that."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "You brought up two issues there."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "So remember I talked early about the constraints we always feel, well, one of those constraints is the fact that brains are continually learning."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "That's not something we said, oh, we can add that later."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "That's something that was upfront, had to be there from the start, made our problems harder."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "But we showed, going back to the 2016

separate phases, or two separate sets of time."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "I think that's a big, big problem in AI, at least for many applications, not for all."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "So I can talk about that."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "There are some, it gets detailed, there are some parts of the neocortex in the brain where actually what's going on, there's these cycles of activity in the brain."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And there's very strong evidence that you're doing more of inference on one part of the phase, and more of learning on the other part of the phase."}, {"time": 5334,

learning."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Going back many, many years, people, you know, it was, what's his name, the psychologist who proposed, Hebb, Donald Hebb."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "He proposed

those mechanisms are known."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "Now there's another thing that we've speculated and we've written about, which is consistent with known neuroscience, but it's less proven."},

anything."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "They're just sitting there."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "It's like if an action potential comes in, it doesn't release any neurotransmitter."}, {"time": 5590,

{"time": 5598, "text": "So what we speculated, again, in that 2016 paper, we proposed that the way we form very quick memories, very short term memories, or quick memories, is that we convert silent synapses into active synapses."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "It's like saying a synapse has a zero weight and a one weight, but the longterm memory has to be formed by synaptogenesis."}, {"time": 5621,

"It's like, it doesn't do anything till it releases transmitter."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And if I do that over a bunch of these, I've got a very quick short term memory."}, {"time": 5636, "text":

connectivity so that any neuron connects to some subset of the neurons in the other layer."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "And it does so on a dendrite by dendrite segment basis."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "So it's a very some parcelated out type of thing."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "And that then learning is not adjusting all these weights, but learning is just saying, okay, connect to these 10 cells here right now."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "In that process, you know, with artificial neural networks, it's a very simple process of backpropagation that adjusts the weights."}, {"time": 5677, "text":

here that are active right now."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "And there's a population of cells over here active right now."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "How do I form connections between those active cells?"}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And it's literally saying this guy became active."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "These 100 neurons here became active before this neuron became active."}, {"time": 5715,

legacy of an old distribution technology."}, {"time": 751, "text": "And you see some of this new music that breaks the format."}, {"time": 753, "text": "Not so much as I would have expected actually

Avicii."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So the main constraint is of time."}, {"time": 769, "text": "Something like a three, four, five minute song."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So you could have songs that were eight minutes, 10 minutes and so forth."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Because it started as a digital product that you downloaded."}, {"time": 781, "text": "So you didn't have this constraint anymore."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So I think it's something really interesting that I don't think has fully happened yet."},

really adhere to the distribution constraints."}, {"time": 800, "text": "If you didn't adhere to that, you would get no distribution."}, {"time": 810, "text": "That was very expensive."}, {"time": 813, "text": "Even though the app store has great distribution, she gets nowhere near the distribution versus staying within the three minute format."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So I think now that

constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture to where we want the five, three to five minute song than anything else, not just."}, {"time": 852, "text": "So we want the song as consumers and as artists, because I write a lot of music and I never even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes."}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's really interesting that those constraints."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Because all your training data has been three and a half minute songs, right?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Okay, so yes, digitization of data led to then mp3s."}, {"time": 876, "text": "Yeah, so I think you had this file then that was distributed physically, but then you had the components of digital distribution and then the internet happened and there was this vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped, but there was no business model."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And then all these pirate networks happened, Napster and in Pirate Island."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Napster and in Sweden Pirate Bay, which was one of the biggest."}, {"time": 902, "text": "And I think from a consumer point of view, which kind of leads up to the

they didn't make any money."}, {"time": 939, "text": "So the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model."}, {"time": 946, "text": "And then there were these download stores that allowed you to download files, which was a solution, but it didn't solve the access problem."}, {"time": 955, "text": "There was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music."}, {"time": 961, "text": "The example I always give is, you know, in Spotify, a huge amount of people listen to music while they sleep, while they go to sleep and while they sleep."}, {"time": 971, "text": "If that costed you 99 cents per three minutes, you probably wouldn't do that."}, {"time": 975, "text":

sporting events."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And usually to me, what that shows is not that they're, they can actually pay the money and they're not trying to save money."}, {"time": 1020, "text":

right."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Spotify stepped in is basically piracy was an experience."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "You can explore with fine music you like, and actually the interface of piracy is horrible because it's, I mean, it's bad metadata, long download times, all kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And what Spotify does is basically first rewards artists and second makes the experience of exploring music much better."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I mean, the same is true, I think for movies and so on."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "That piracy reveals in the software space, for example, I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe products and there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went to a monthly subscription plan."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And now all of

development."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I think that's a sign of it."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "In Sweden, I think it was a bit of both."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "There was a culture where we even had a political party called the Pirate Party."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And this was during the time when people said that information should be free."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "It was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "So I think people felt that artists should probably make some money somehow else and concerts or something."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So at least in Sweden, it was part really social acceptance, even at the political level."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "But that also forced Spotify to compete with free, which I don't think would actually could have happened anywhere else in the world."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "The music industry needed to be doing bad enough to take that risk."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And Sweden was like the perfect testing ground."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "It had government funded high bandwidth, low latency broadband, which meant that the product would work."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And it was also there was no music revenue anyway."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So they were kind of like, I don't think this is going to work, but why not?"}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So this product is one that I don't think could have happened in America, the world's largest music market, for example."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So how do you compete with free?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Because that's an interesting world of the internet where most people don't like to pay for things."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So Spotify steps in and tries to, yes, compete with free."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "How do you do it?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So I think two things."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "One is people are starting to pay for things on the internet."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I think one way to think about it was that advertising was the first business model because no one would put a credit card on the internet."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Transactional with Amazon was the second."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "And maybe subscription is the third."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And if you look offline, subscription is the biggest of those."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So that may still happen."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I think people are starting to pay for things."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But definitely back then, we needed to compete with free."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need to be better somehow."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience, on the actual performance, the latency of, you know, even if you had high bandwidth broadband, it would still take you 30 seconds to a minute to download one of these tracks."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy, about 250 milliseconds, meant that the whole trick was it felt as if you had downloaded all of Pirate Bay."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "It was on your hard drive."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It was that fast, even though it wasn't."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And it was still free."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "But somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And that was the trick that Spotify managed to pull off."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So I've actually heard you say this or write this."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And I was surprised that I wasn't aware of it because I just took it for granted."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "You know, whenever an awesome thing comes along, you're just like, of course, it has to be this way."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "That's exactly right."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "That it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because of that latency being reduced."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "What was the technical challenge in reducing the latency?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So there was a group of really, really talented engineers, one of them called Ludwig Strigius."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "He wrote the, actually from Gothenburg, he wrote the initial, the uTorrent client, which is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify, that we have one of the top developers from uTorrent clients as well."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So he wrote uTorrent, the world's smallest uTorrent client."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "And then he was acquired very early by Daniel and Martin, who founded Spotify, and they actually sold the uTorrent client to BitTorrent, but kept Ludwig."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So Spotify had a lot of experience within peer to peer networking."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So the original innovation was a distribution innovation, where Spotify built an end to end media distribution system up until only a few years ago, we actually hosted all the music ourselves."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So we had both the service side and the client, and that meant that we could do things such as having a peer to peer solution to use local caching on the client side, because back then the world was mostly desktop."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "But we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols, things like Nagel's algorithm for kind of exponential back off, or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize for latency at the cost of bandwidth."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And all of this end to end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a step change."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "These days, we actually are on GCP, we don't host our own stuff, and everyone is really fast these days."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So that was the initial competitive advantage."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "But then obviously, you have to move on over time."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And that was over 10 years ago, right?"}, {"time": 1374, "text": "That was in 2008."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "The product was launched in Sweden."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "It was in a beta, I think, 2007."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And it was on the desktop, right?"}, {"time": 1380, "text": "It was desktop only."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "There's no phone."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "There was no phone."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "The iPhone came out in 2008."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "But the App Store came out one year later, I think."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So the writing was on the wall, but there was no phone yet."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "You've mentioned that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they like, and then they would torrent those songs to so they can copy it to their phone."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Not torrent, pirate."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Seriously, piracy does seem to be like a good guide for business models."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Video content."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "As far as I know, Spotify doesn't have video content."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Well, we do have music videos, and we do have videos on the service."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "But the way we think about ourselves is that we're an audio service, and we think that if you look at the amount of time that people spend on audio, it's actually very similar to the amount of time that people spend on music."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It's very similar to the amount of time that people spend on video."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So the opportunity should be equally big."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "But today, it's not at all valued."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Videos value much higher."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So we think it's basically completely undervalued."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So we think of ourselves as an audio service."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "But within that audio service, I think video can make a lot of sense."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "I think when you're discovering an artist, you probably do want to see them and understand who they are, to understand their identity."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "You won't see that video every time."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "90% of the time, the phone is going to be in your pocket."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "For podcasters, you use video."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I think that can make a ton of sense."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So we do have video, but we're an audio service where, think of it as we call it internally, backgroundable video."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Video that is helpful, but isn't the driver of the narrative."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "I think also, if we look at YouTube, there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So in some sense, YouTube is a bit of a competitor to Spotify, which is very strange to me that people use YouTube to listen to music."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "They play essentially the music videos, right?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Well, I think it's similar to what, strangely, maybe it's similar to what we were for the piracy networks, where YouTube, for historical reasons, have a lot of music videos."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part of the process, I think."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "But then it's not a really good sort of, quote unquote, MP3 player, because it doesn't even background."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Then you have to keep the app in the foreground."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So it's not a good consumption tool, but it's a decently good discovery."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "I mean, I think YouTube is a fantastic product."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And I use it for all kinds of purposes."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "If I were to admit something, I do use YouTube a little bit to assist in the discovery process of songs."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And then if I like it, I'll add it to Spotify."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "But that's OK. That's OK with us."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "OK, so sorry, we're jumping around a little bit."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "So it's kind of incredible."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "You look at Napster, you look at the early days of Spotify."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "One fascinating point is how do you grow a user base?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So you're there in Sweden."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "You have an idea."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "I saw the initial sketches that look terrible."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "How do you grow a user base from a few folks to millions?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I think there are a bunch of tactical answers."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So first of all, I think you need a great product."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I don't think you take a bad product and market it to be successful."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So you need a great product."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "But sorry to interrupt, but it's a totally new way to listen to music, too."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So it's not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product?"}, {"time": 1598, "text": "No, I think they did."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So back to the point of piracy, it was a totally new way to listen to music legally."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "But people had been used to the access model in Sweden and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So one way to think about Spotify, it was just legal and fast piracy."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And so people have been using it for a long time."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So they weren't alien to it."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "They didn't really understand how it could be illegal because it seemed too fast and too good to be true, which I think is a great product proposition if you can be too good to be true."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But what I saw again and again was people showing each other, clicking the song, showing how fast it started and say, can you believe this?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So I really think it was about speed."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Then we also had an invite program that was really meant for scaling because we hosted our own service."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "We needed to control scaling."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "But that built a lot of expectation."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And I don't want to say hype because hype implies that it wasn't true."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Excitement around the product."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "And we've replicated that when we launched in the US."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "We also built up an invite only program first."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "There are lots of tactics, but I think you need a great product to solve some problem."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "And basically the key innovation, there was technology, but on a meta level, the innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And that was tricky."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "A lot of people said that they wanted to be able to do it."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "I mean, they wanted to own their music."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "They would never kind of rent it or borrow it."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "But I think the fact that we had a free tier, which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well, helped quite a lot."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So this is an interesting psychological point that maybe you can speak to."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "It was a big shift for me."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "It's almost like I had to go to therapy for this."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "I think I would describe my early listening experience, and I think a lot of my friends do, as basically hoarding music."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "As you're like slowly, one song by one song, or maybe albums, gathering a collection of music that you love."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And you own it."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "It's like often, especially with CDs or tape, you like physically had it."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And what Spotify, what I had to come to grips with, it was kind of liberating actually, is to throw away all the music."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "I've had this therapy session with lots of people."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "And I think the mental trick is, so actually we've seen the user data."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "When Spotify started, a lot of people did the exact same thing."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "They started hoarding as if the music would disappear."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Almost the equivalent of downloading."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And so we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand tracks."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "We figured no one will ever."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "Well, they do."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Nuts and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And to this day, some people want to actually save, quote unquote, and then play the entire catalog."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "But I think the therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music, if you took your files and you stored them in the locker at Google, it'd be a streaming service."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "It's just that in that locker, you have all the world's music now for free."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So instead of giving away your music, you got all the music."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "You could think of it as having a copy of the world's catalog there forever."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "So you actually got more music instead of less."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "It's just that you just took that hard disk and you sent it to someone who stored it for you."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And once you go through that mental journey, I'm like, it's still my files."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "They're just over there."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "And I just have 40 million or 50 million or something now."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Then people are like, OK, that's good."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "The problem is, I think, because you paid us a subscription, if we hadn't had the free tier where you would feel like, even if I don't want to pay anymore, I still get to keep them."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "You keep your playlist forever."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "They don't disappear even though you stop paying."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "I think that was really important."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "If we would have started as, you know, you can put in all this time, but if you stop paying, you lose all your work."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "I think that would have been a big challenge and was the big challenge for a lot of our competitors."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "That's another reason why I think the free tier is really important."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "That people need to feel the security, that the work they put in, it will never disappear, even if they decide not to pay."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "I like how you put the work you put in."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "I actually stopped even thinking of it that way."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "I just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music as opposed to."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "As opposed to what I was doing before, which is like in an unhealthy way, hoarding music."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Which I found that because I was doing that, I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to where I was getting sick of them."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Whereas Spotify, the more liberating kind of approach is I was just enjoying."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "Of course, I listened to Stairway to Heaven over and over, but because of the extra variety, I don't get as sick of them."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "There's an interesting statistic I saw."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So Spotify has, maybe you can correct me, but over 50 million songs, tracks, and over 3 billion playlists."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So 50 million songs and 3 billion playlists."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "60 times more playlist songs."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "What do you make of that?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So the way I think about it is that from a statistician or machine learning point of view, you have all these, if you want to think about reinforcement learning, you have this state space of all the tracks."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "You can take different journeys through this world."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "I think of these as people helping themselves and each other, creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And then it's not so surprising that across many tens of millions of atomic units, there will be billions of paths that make sense."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And we're probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So kind of our job now is users, when Spotify started, it was really a search box that was for the time pretty powerful."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And then I'd like to refer to it as this programming language called playlisting, where if you, as you probably were pretty good at music, you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog, you knew your star with the heaven, you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlisting tool, this like meta programming language for music to soundtrack your life."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And people who were good at music, it's back to how do you scale the product."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "For people who are good at music, that wasn't actually enough."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "If you had the catalog and a good search tool, and you can create your own sessions, you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "But the problem was most people, many people aren't that good at music."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "They just can't spend the time."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "Even if you're very good at music, it's going to be hard to keep up."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "So what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build, you can think of them as agents that this friend that some people had that helped them navigate this music catalog."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "That's what we're trying to do for you."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "But also there is something like 200 million active users."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "1 million active users on Spotify."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So there it's okay."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So from the machine learning perspective, you have these 200 million people plus they're creating."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "It's really interesting to think of a playlist as, I mean, I don't know if you meant it that way, but it's almost like a programming language."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "It's or at least a trace of exploration of those individual agents."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "The listeners and you have all this new tracks coming in."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "So it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "So is there, is it possible, how can playlists be used as data in terms of machine learning and to help Spotify organize the music?"}, {"time": 2064, "text": "So we found in our data, not surprising that people who play listed lots they retain much better."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "They had a great experience."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "And so our first attempt was to playlist for users."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors and professional playlisters and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence to help build kind of these vectors through the track space for people."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "And that broadened the product."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "But then the obvious next, and we use statistical means, where they could see when they created a playlist, how did that playlist perform?"}, {"time": 2102, "text": "They could see skips of the songs, they could see how the songs perform, and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "But there were never enough editors to playlists for you personally."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization using editors and tools and statistics to individualization."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "And then what's so interesting about the 3 billion playlists we have is we ended, the truth is we lucked out."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "This was not a priority strategy, as is often the case."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "It looks really smart in hindsight, but it was dumb luck."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "We looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company, a person named Eric Beranodson."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "He was really good at machine learning already back then in like 2007, 2008."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "Back then it was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "But we realized that what this is, is people are grouping tracks for themselves that have some semantic meaning to them."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And then they actually label it with a playlist name as well."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "So in a sense, people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "And so could you use that information to find that latent embedding?"}, {"time": 2175, "text": "And so we started playing around with collaborative filtering and we saw tremendous success with it."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "And if you think about it, it's not surprising at all."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "It'd be quite surprising if playlists were actually random, if they had no semantic meaning."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "For most people, they group these tracks for some reason."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "So we just happened across this incredible data set."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Where people are taking these tens of millions of tracks and group them along different semantic vectors."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "And the semantics being outside the individual users."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "So it's some kind of universal."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "There's a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find are going to be reflective of the people who play listed."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So if you have a lot of indie lovers who play list, your embedding is going to perform better there."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "But what we found was that yes, there were these latent similarities."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "They were very powerful."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most initially were the so called music aficionados who were really into music."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "And they often had a certain... Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "And so what surprised us, if you look at the problem from the outside, you might expect that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste than really particular taste."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "It was the complete opposite for us."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "The recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as having very unique taste."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "That's probably because all of them play listed."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And they didn't perform so well for mainstreamers."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "They actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So we had the complete opposite of what we expected."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Success within the hardest problem first, and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So you've also acquired Echo Nest that analyzes song data."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So in your view, maybe you can talk about, so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective?"}, {"time": 2311, "text": "From a machine learning perspective, there's a huge amount."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "We're talking about playlisting and just user data of what people are listening to, the playlist they're constructing, and so on."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "And then there's the actual data within a song."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "What makes a song, I don't know, the actual waveforms."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "How do you mix the two?"}, {"time": 2335, "text": "How much value is there in each?"}, {"time": 2337, "text": "To me, it seems like user data is a romantic notion that the song itself would contain useful information."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "But if I were to guess, user data would be much more powerful, like playlists would be much more powerful."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Yeah, so we use both."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "Our biggest success initially was with playlist data without understanding anything about the structure of the song."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "But when we acquired Echo Nest, they had the inverse problem."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "They actually didn't have any play data."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "They were just, they were a provider of recommendations, but they didn't actually have any play data."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "So they looked at the structure of songs, sonically, and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth, right?"}, {"time": 2380, "text": "And did a lot of NLU and so forth."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "So we got that skill into the company and combined kind of our user data with their kind of content based."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So you can think of it as we were user based and they were content based in their recommendations."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "And we combined those two."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "And for some cases where you have a new song that has no play data, obviously you have to try to go by either who the artist is or the sonic information in the song or what it's similar to."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "So there's definitely a value in both and we do a lot in both, but I would say, yes, the user data captures things that have to do with culture in the greater society that you would never see in the content itself."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "But that said, we have seen, we have a research lab in Paris when we can talk more about that on machine learning on the creator side, what it can do for creators, not just for the consumers, but where we looked at how does the structure of a song actually affect the listening behavior?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "And it turns out that there is a lot of, we can predict things like skips based on the song itself."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "We could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit because your skip is going to go up here."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "There is a lot of latent structure in the music, which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "So there should be structure."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "That's probably what we respond to."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "You just blew my mind actually from the creator perspective."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "So that's a really interesting topic that probably most creators aren't taking advantage of, right?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So I've recently got to interact with a few folks, YouTubers who are like obsessed with this idea of what do I do to make sure people keep watching the video?"}, {"time": 2487, "text": "And they like look at the analytics of which point do people turn it off and so on."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "First of all, I don't think that's healthy, but it's because you can do it a little too much."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "But it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "You just made me realize you could do the same thing for creation of music."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "And so is that something you've looked into?"}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And can you speak to how much opportunity there is for that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Yeah, so I listened to the podcast with Ziraj and I thought it was fantastic and I reacted to the same thing where he said he posted something in the morning, immediately watched the feedback where the drop off was and then responded to that in the afternoon, which is quite different from how people make podcasts, for example."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I mean, the feedback loop is almost non existent."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So if we back out one level, I think actually both for music and podcasts, which we also do at Spotify, I think there's a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And I think it's really interesting speaking to you who, because you're a musician, a developer, and a podcaster."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "If you think about those three different roles, if you make the leap as a musician, if you think about it as a software tool chain, really, your DAW with the stems, that's the IDE, right?"}, {"time": 2566, "text": "That's where you work in source code format with what you're creating."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Then you sit around and you play with that."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And when you're happy, you compile that thing into some sort of AAC or MP3 or something."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "You do that because you get distribution."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "There are so many runtimes for that MP3 across the world in car stairs and stuff."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So if you kind of compile this execution, you ship it out in kind of an old fashioned boxed software analogy."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And then you hope for the best, right?"}, {"time": 2591, "text": "But as a software developer, you would never do that."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "First, you go on GitHub and you collaborate with other creators."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "And then you think it'd be crazy to just ship one version of your software without doing an A B test, without any feedback loop."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "Issue tracking."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And then you would look at the feedback loop and say, try to optimize that thing, right?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So I think if you think of it as a very specific software tool chain, it looks quite arcane, the tools that a music creator has versus what a software developer has."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So that's kind of how we think about it."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Why wouldn't a music creator have something like GitHub where you could collaborate much more easily?"}, {"time": 2634, "text": "So we bought this company called Soundtrap, which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach, where you can collaborate with other people on the kind of source code format with Stems."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "And I think introducing things like AI tools there to help you as you're creating music, both in helping you put accompaniment to your music, like drums or something, help you master and mix automatically, help you understand how this track will perform."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Exactly what you would expect as a software developer."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "I think it makes a lot of sense."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "And I think the same goes for a podcaster."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop that Siraj has, like, why wouldn't you?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Maybe it's not healthy, but..."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Sorry, I wanted to criticize the fact because you can overdo it because a lot of the, and we're in a new era of that."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "So you can become addicted to it and therefore, what people say, you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm or sort of, it's always a danger of a new technology as opposed to say, if you're creating a song, becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song that keeps people listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "It's a balance."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "But the fact that there's zero, I mean, you're blowing my mind right now, because you're completely right that there is no signal whatsoever."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "There's no feedback whatsoever on the creation process and music or podcasting, almost at all."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And are you saying that Spotify is hoping to help create tools to, not tools, but... No, tools actually."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Actually, tools."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Tools for creators."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "So we've made some acquisitions the last few years around music creation, this company called Soundtrap, which is a digital audio workstation, but that is browser based."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And their focus was really the Google Docs approach."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "We can collaborate with people much more easily than you could in previous tools."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "So we have some of these tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible and then we can connect it with our consumption data."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "We can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand, we could help you create and help you understand how you will perform."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "We also acquired this other company within podcasting called Anchor, which is one of the biggest podcasting tools, mobile focused."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "So really focused on simple creation or easy access to creation."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "But that also gives us this feedback loop."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And even before that, we invested in something called Spotify for Artists and Spotify for Podcasters, which is an app that you can download, you can verify that you are that creator."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "And then you get things that software developers have had for years."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "You can see where, if you look at your podcast, for example, on Spotify or a song that you released, you can see how it's performing, which cities it's performing in, who's listening to it, what's the demographic breakup."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "So similar in the sense that you can understand how you're actually doing on the platform."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So we definitely want to build tools."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "I think you also interviewed the head of research for Adobe."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And I think that's an, back to Photoshop that you like, I think that's an interesting analogy as well."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "Photoshop, I think, has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "And I think there should be the same kind of tools for music creators, where you could get AI assistance, for example, as you're creating music, as you can do with Adobe, where you can, I want a sky over here and you can get help creating that sky."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "The really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't have is a distribution for the content you create."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "So you don't have the data of if I create, if I, you know, whatever creation I make in Photoshop or Premiere, I can't get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube, for example, about the way people are responding."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "And if Spotify is creating those tools, that's a really exciting actually world."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "But let's talk a little about podcasts."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "So I have trouble talking to one person."}, {"time": 2900, "text": "So it's a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom, but on average, 60 to 100,000 people will listen to this episode."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Okay, so it's intimidating."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "Yeah, it's intimidating."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So I hosted on Blueberry."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly, actually."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It looks like most people listen to it on Apple Podcasts, Cast Box and Pocket Casts, and only about a thousand listen on Spotify."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "It's just my podcast, right?"}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this?"}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting site."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "Yeah, in podcasting."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "What's the deal with podcasting and Spotify?"}, {"time": 2950, "text": "How serious is Spotify about podcasting?"}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Do you see a time where everybody would listen to, you know, probably a huge amount of people, majority perhaps listen to music on Spotify?"}, {"time": 2962, "text": "Do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "Well, I certainly hope so."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "That is our mission."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "Our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art, and a billion people be inspired by it."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And what I think is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the creators first, even though it started as a consumer focused company, and it's just to be able to live off of their art, not just make some money off of their art as well."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So it's quite an ambitious project."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "So we think about creators of all kinds, and we kind of expanded our mission from being music to being audio a while back."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "And that's not so much because we think we made that decision."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "We think that decision was made for us."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "We think the world made that decision."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "Whether we like it or not, when you put in your headphones, you're going to make a choice between music and a new episode of your podcast or something else."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "We're in that world whether we like it or not."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "And that's how radio works."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So we decided that we think it's about audio."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "You can see the rise of audiobooks and so forth."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "We think audio is a great opportunity."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So we decided to enter it."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "And obviously, Apple and Apple Podcasts is absolutely dominating in podcasting, and we didn't have a single podcast only like two years ago."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "What we did though was we looked at this and said, can we bring something to this?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "We want to do this, but back to the original Spotify, we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to do this."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "And the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being quite a wide margin, the second largest podcast consumption, still wide gap to iTunes, but we're growing quite fast."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "I think it's because when we looked at the consumer problem, people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the same application."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach where we said, instead of building a separate podcast app, we thought, is there a consumer problem to solve here?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "Because the others are very successful already."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "And we thought there was in making a more seamless experience where you can have your podcast and your music in the same application, because we think it's audio to you."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And that has been successful."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And that meant that we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from zero."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So I think we have a good chance because we're taking a different approach than the competition."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "And back to the other thing I mentioned about creators, because we're looking at the end to end flow."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a format."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "When we have creation tools and consumption, I think we could start improving what podcasting is."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "I mean, podcast is this opaque, big, like one, two hour file that you're streaming, which it really doesn't make that much sense in 2019 that it's not interactive."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "There's no feedback loops, nothing like that."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So I think if we're going to win, it's going to have to be because we build a better product for creators and for consumers."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So we'll see, but it's certainly our goal."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "We have a long way to go."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "Well, the creators part is really exciting."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "You already, you got me hooked there."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "Cause the only stats I have, Blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it's listened to the end or not."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "And that's like a huge improvement, but that's still nowhere to where you could possibly go in terms of statistics."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "You just download the Spotify podcasters up and verify."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "And then, then you'll know where people dropped out in this episode."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "The moment I started talking."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "I might be depressed by this, but okay."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "So one, um, one other question is the original Spotify for music."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "And I have a question about podcasting in this line is the idea of podcasting about podcasting in this line is the idea of albums."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "I have, uh, what did you, uh, music aficionados, uh, friends who are really, uh, big fans of music often, uh, really enjoy albums, listening to entire albums of, of an artist."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like Spotify has helped replace the idea of an album with playlists."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So you create your own albums."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "It's, it's kind of the way, at least I've experienced music and I've really enjoyed it that way."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "One of the things that was missing in podcasting for me, I don't know if it's missing."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "It's an open question for me, but the way I listened to podcasts is the way I would listen to albums."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "So I take a Joe Rogan experience and that's an album."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "And I listened, you know, I like, I, I put that on and I listened one episode after the next, then there's a sequence and so on."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "Is there a room for doing what you did for music or doing what Spotify did for music, but, uh, creating playlists, sort of, uh, this kind of playlisting idea of breaking apart from podcasting, uh, from individual podcasts and creating kind of, uh, this interplay or, or have you thought about that space?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Uh, it's a great question."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So I think in, um, in music, you're right."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Basically you bought an album."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So it was like, you bought a small catalog of like 10 tracks, right?"}, {"time": 3282, "text": "It was, it was, again, it was actually a lot of, a lot of consumption."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "You think it's about what you like, but it's based on the business model."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "So you paid for this 10 track service and then you listened to that for a while."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "And then when, when everything was flat priced, you tended to listen differently."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Now, so, so I think the, I think the album is still tremendously important."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "That's why we have it and you can save albums and so forth."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And I like that because it is a creator format, you can tell a longer story over several tracks."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And so some people listen to just one track."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "Some people actually want to hear that whole story."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "Now in podcast, I think, I think it's different."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "You can argue that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "Have like a full season of Narcos and you're probably not going to do like one episode of Narcos and then one of House of Cards, like, like, you know, there's a narrative there."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "And you, you, you love the cast and you love these characters."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So I think people will, people love shows."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "And I think they will, they will listen to those shows."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "So there's certainly an opportunity to bring you the latest episode of, you know, whatever the five, six, 10 things that, that you're into."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "But, but I think, I think people are going to listen to specific hosts and love those hosts for a long time."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "Because I think there's something different with podcasts where, um, this format of the, the, the, the, the, the experience of the, of the audience is actually sitting here right between us."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Whereas if you look at something on TV, the audio actually would come from, you would sit over there and the audio would come to you from both of us as if you were watching, not as you were part of the conversation."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So my experience is having listened to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is, I feel like I know all of these people."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "They, they have a lot of experience."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "I know all of these people, they have no idea who I am, but I feel like I've listened to so many hours of that."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "It's very different from me watching a, watching like a TV show or an interview."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "So I think you, you kind of, um, fall in love with people and, um, experience in a, in a different way."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "So I think, I think shows and hosts are going to be very, uh, very important."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "I don't think that's going to go away into some sort of thing where, where you don't even know who you're listening to."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "I don't think that's going to happen."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "What I do think is I think there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in podcast because the catalog is growing quite quickly."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "And I think podcast is only a few, like five, 600,000 shows right now."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "If you look back to YouTube as another analogy of creators, no one really knows if you would lift the lid on YouTube, but it's probably billions of episodes."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously because the creation tools are getting easier."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "And then you're going to have this discovery opportunity that I think is really big."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So, so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows, but discovering podcasts kind of suck."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "It's really hard to get into new show."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "They're usually quite long."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "It's a big time investment."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "So I think there's plenty of opportunity in the discovery part."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Yeah, for sure."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "A hundred percent in, in even the dumbest, there's so many low hanging fruit too."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Uh, for example, just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Uh, because most podcasts don't have an order to them."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Uh, they, they can be listened to out of order and sorry to say some are better than others episodes."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "So some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And it's nice to know, uh, which you should listen to, to try it out."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "And there's, uh, as far as I know, almost no information, uh, in terms of like, uh, upvotes on how good an episode is."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "So I think part of the problem is, uh, you, it's kind of like music."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "There isn't one answer."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "People use music for different things and there's actually many different types of music."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "There's workout music and there's classical piano music and focus music and, and, and, uh, so forth."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "I think the same with podcasts."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Some podcasts are sequential."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "They're supposed to be listened to in, in order."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "It's actually, it's actually telling a narrative."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Some podcasts are one topic, uh, kind of like yours, but different guests."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "So you could jump in anywhere."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Some podcasts actually have completely different topics."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "And for those podcasts, it might be that I want, you know, we should recommend one episode because it's about AI from someone, but then they talk about something that you're not interested in the rest of the episodes."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "So I think our, what we're spending a lot of time on now is just first understanding the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how do people consume."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And I think we'll find that it's going to be, it's going to be different."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "I'm excited because you're the, uh, Spotify is the first people I'm aware of that are trying to do this for podcasting."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "Podcasting has been like a wild west up until now."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "It's been a very, we want to be very careful though, because it's been a very good wild west, I think it's this fragile ecosystem."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "And I, we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like, Oh, we're going to internetize this thing."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "And you have to think about the creators."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "You have to understand how they get distribution today, who listens to how they make money today, try to, you know, make sure that their business model works, that they understand."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "I think it's back to doing something to improving their products, like feedback loops and distribution."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of a recommender system and listening to music and using machine learning to analyze things, do you think it's better to what currently, correct me if I'm wrong, but currently Spotify lets people pick what they listen to the most part."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "There's a discovery process, but you kind of organize playlists."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen to something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you're playing around with?"}, {"time": 3644, "text": "Maybe you can tell me what's the status of that."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "This is a Pandora style app that just kind of, as opposed to you select the music you listen to, it kind of feeds you the music you listen to."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "What's the status of stations by Spotify?"}, {"time": 3660, "text": "What's its future?"}, {"time": 3661, "text": "The story of Spotify, as we have grown, has been that we made it more accessible to different audiences and stations is another one of those where the question is, some people want to be very specific."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "They actually want to hear Starway to Heaven right now, that needs to be very easy to do."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And some people, or even the same person, at some point might say, I want to feel upbeat or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "So they put in the information at a very different level and then we need to translate that into what that means musically."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "So stations is a test to create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you can just tune it a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "But we're trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super advanced so called music aficionados all the way to people who they love listening to music but it's not their number one priority in life."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "They're not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "They need to be able to influence music at a different level."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So you can think of it as different products and I think one of the interesting things to answer your question on if it's better to let the user choose or to play, I think the answer is the challenge when machine learning kind of came along, there was a lot of thinking about what does product development mean in a machine learning context."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "People like Andrew Ng, for example, when he went to Baidu, he started doing a lot of practical machine learning, went from academia and he thought a lot about this and he had this notion that a product manager, designer and engineer, they used to work around this wireframe to kind of describe what the product should look like."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "It was something to talk about when you're doing a chatbot or a playlist, what are you going to say?"}, {"time": 3774, "text": "It should be good."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "That's not a good product description."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "So how do you do that?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "And he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "The job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of what, like if you say I want to play this, that is songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "The job of the product manager is to go and source a good test set of what that means."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "So then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So we try to think a lot about how to structure product development for a machine learning age."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "And what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And you can go two ways."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "So let's say that if you set the expectation with the user that this is a discovery product, like Discover Weekly, you're actually setting the expectation that most of what we show you will not be relevant."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "When you're in the discovery process, you're going to accept that actually if you find one gem every Monday that you totally love, you're probably going to be happy."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Even though the statistical meaning, one out of 10 is terrible or one out of 20 is terrible from a user point of view because the setting was discovery is fine."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "Sorry to interrupt real quick."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "I just actually learned about Discover Weekly, which is a Spotify, I don't know, it's a feature of Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen to."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "Maybe I can do issue tracking."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "I couldn't find it on my Spotify app."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "It's in your library."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "It's in the library."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "It's in the list of library."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "Because I was like, whoa, this is cool."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "I didn't know this existed."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And I tried to find it."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "I will show it to you and feedback to our product team."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "There you go."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "But yeah, so yeah, sorry."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Just to mention the expectation there is basically that you're going to discover new songs."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So then you can be quite adventurous in the recommendations you do."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "But we have another product called Daily Mix, which kind of implies that these are only going to be your favorites."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "So if you have one out of 10 that is good and nine out of 10 that doesn't work for you, you're going to think it's a horrible product."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "So actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years is about setting the right expectations."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "So for Daily Mix, you know, algorithmically, we would pick among things that feel very safe in your taste space."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Whereas Discover Weekly, we go kind of wild because the expectation is most of this is not going to."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So a lot of that, a lot of to answer your question there, a lot of should you let the user pick or not?"}, {"time": 3923, "text": "We have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play, put the phone in the pocket, and it should be really good music for like an hour."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "We have other products where you probably need to say like, no, no, save, no, no."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "And it's very interactive."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "That makes sense."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "And then the radio product, the stations product is one of these like click play, put in your pocket for hours."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "So you're thinking of different test sets for different users and trying to create products that sort of optimize for those test sets that represent a specific set of users."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "Yes, I think one thing that I think is interesting is we invested quite heavily in editorial in people creating playlists using statistical data."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "And that was successful for us."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And then we also invested in machine learning."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "And for the longest time within Spotify and within the rest of the industry, there was always this narrative of humans versus the machine, algo versus editorial."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "And editors would say like, well, if I had that data, if I could see your playlisting history and I made a choice for you, I would have made a better choice."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "And they would have because they're much smarter than these algorithms."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "The human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "They can take culture into account and so forth."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "The problem is that they can't make 200 million decisions per hour for every user that logs in."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So the algo may be not as sophisticated, but much more efficient."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "So there was this contradiction."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "But then a few years ago, we started focusing on this kind of human in the loop thinking around machine learning."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "And we actually coined an internal term for it called algotorial, a combination of algorithms and editors, where if we take a concrete example, you think of the editor, this paid expert that we have that's really good at something like soul, hip hop, EDM, something, right?"}, {"time": 4040, "text": "They're a true expert, no one in the industry."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So they have all the cultural knowledge."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "You think of them as the product manager."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "And you say that, let's say that you want to create a, you think that there's a product need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or songs to sing in the shower."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "I'm taking that example because it exists."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "People love to scream songs in the car when they drive, right?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "So you want to create that product and you have this product manager who's a musical expert."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "They create, they come up with a concept, like I think this is a missing thing in humanity, like a playlist called songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "They create the framing, the image, the title, and they create a test set of, they create a group of songs, like a few thousand songs out of the catalog that they manually curate that are known songs that are great to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And they can take like true romance into account."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "They understand things that our algorithms do not at all."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So they have this huge set of tracks."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Then when we deliver that to you, we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing in the car in your taste."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So you have personalization and editorial input in the same process, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Yeah, it makes total sense."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "And I have several questions around that."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "This is like fascinating."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "So first, it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming machines at specifying songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So maybe you could talk to that a little bit."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "I don't know if you can put it into words, but what is it?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "How difficult is this problem?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "Do you really, I guess what I'm trying to ask is there, how difficult is it to encode the cultural references, the context of the song, the artists, all those things together?"}, {"time": 4154, "text": "Can machine learning really not do that?"}, {"time": 4157, "text": "I mean, I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the patterns."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "But if you try to write with me a spec of what song's greatest song to sing in the car definition is, is it loud?"}, {"time": 4170, "text": "Does it have many choruses?"}, {"time": 4171, "text": "Should it have been in movies?"}, {"time": 4172, "text": "It quickly gets incredibly complicated, right?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "It could be cultural references because, you know, it was a history."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "So the definition problems quickly get, and I think that was the insight of Andrew Ng when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that algorithms don't and then define what that looks like."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "And then you have something to train towards, right?"}, {"time": 4200, "text": "Then you have kind of the test set."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "And then so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "You could easily imagine that once you have this set, you could have some automatic exploration on the rest of the catalog because then you understand what it is."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And then the other side of it, when machine learning does help is this taste vector."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "How hard is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human likes, this human preference?"}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So you can, you know, music isn't like, it's not like Amazon, like things you usually buy."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "Music seems more amorphous."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "Like it's this thing that's hard to specify."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Like what is, you know, if you look at my playlist, what is the music that I love?"}, {"time": 4248, "text": "It's harder."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "It seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "So how hard is it to build a taste vector?"}, {"time": 4257, "text": "It is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "And I think what we found was that, so it's not a stationary problem."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "It changes over time."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And so we've gone through the journey of, if you've done a lot of computer vision, obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision in my past."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "And we started kind of with the handcrafted heuristics for, you know, this is kind of indie music."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "This is this."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And if you consume this, you'd probably like this."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So we have, we started there and we have some of that still."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Then what was interesting about the playlist data was that you could find these latent things that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "That could even capture maybe cultural references because they cooccurred."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "Things that wouldn't have appeared kind of mechanistically either in the content or so forth."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "So I think that, I think the core assumption is that there are patterns in almost everything."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And if there are patterns, these embedding techniques are getting better and better now."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "Now, as everyone else, we're also using kind of deep embeddings where you can encode binary values and so forth."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And what I think is interesting is this process to try to find things that do not necessarily, you wouldn't actually have guessed."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So it is very hard in an engineering sense to find the right dimensions."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "It's an incredible scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to update it every day."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "But in theory, in theory embeddings isn't that complicated."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "The fact that you try to find some principal components or something like that, dimensionality reduction and so forth."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "So the theory, I guess, is easy."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "The practice is very, very hard."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "And it's a huge engineering challenge."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "But fortunately, we have some amazing both research and engineering teams in this space."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Yeah, I guess the question is all, I mean, it's similar."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "I deal with it with autonomous vehicle spaces."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "The question is how hard is driving?"}, {"time": 4387, "text": "And here is basically the question is of edge cases."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "So embedding probably works, not probably, but I would imagine works well in a lot of cases."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So there's a bunch of questions that arise then."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "So do song preferences, does your taste vector depend on context, like mood, right?"}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So there's different moods, and so how does that take in it?"}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Is it possible to take that as a consideration?"}, {"time": 4424, "text": "Or do you just leave that as a interface problem that allows the user to just control it?"}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So when I'm looking for workout music, I kind of specify it by choosing certain playlists, doing certain search."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "Yeah, so that's a great point."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Back to the product development."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "You could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you're in automatically when you open Spotify, or you create a tab which is happy and sad, right?"}, {"time": 4448, "text": "And you're going to be right 100% of the time with one click."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Now, it's probably much better to let the user tell you if they're happy or sad, or if they want to work out."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "On the other hand, if your user interface becomes 2,000 tabs, you're introducing so much friction so no one will use the product."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "So then you have to get better."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "So it's this thing where you have to be able to get better."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So then you have to get better, so it's this thing where I think maybe it was, I don't remember who coined it, but it's called fault tolerant UIs, right?"}, {"time": 4475, "text": "You build a UI that is tolerant of being wrong, and then you can be much less right in your algorithms."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "So we've had to learn a lot of that."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "Building the right UI that fits where the machine learning is, and a great discovery there, which was by the teams during one of our hack days, was this thing of taking discovery, packaging it into a playlist, and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might like based on this."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And setting the right expectation made it a great product."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "So I think we have this benefit that, for example, Tesla doesn't have that we can change the expectation."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "We can build a fault tolerant setting."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "It's very hard to be fault tolerant when you're driving at 100 miles per hour or something."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "And we have the luxury of being able to say that of being wrong if we have the right UI, which gives us different abilities to take more risk."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "So I actually think the self driving problem is much harder."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Oh, yeah, for sure."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "It's much less fun because people die."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "And in Spotify, it's such a more fun problem because failure is beautiful in a way."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "It leads to exploration."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So it's a really fun reinforcement learning problem."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "The worst case scenario is you get these WTF tweets like, how did I get this?"}, {"time": 4562, "text": "This song, yeah."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "Which is a lot better than the self driving."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "Exactly, so what's the feedback that a user, what's the signal that a user provides into the system?"}, {"time": 4575, "text": "So you mentioned skipping."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "What is like the strongest signal?"}, {"time": 4582, "text": "You didn't mention clicking like."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "So we have a few signals that are important."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "Obviously playing, playing through."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "So one of the benefits of music, actually, even compared to podcasts or movies is the object itself is really only about three minutes."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "So you get a lot of chances to recommend and the feedback loop is every three minutes instead of every two hours or something."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "So you actually get kind of noisy, but quite fast feedback."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And so you can see if people play through, which is the inverse of skip really."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "That's an important signal."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "On the other hand, much of the consumption happens when your phone is in your pocket."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "Maybe you're running or driving or you're playing on a speaker."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And so you not skipping doesn't mean that you love that song."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "It may be that it wasn't bad enough that you would walk up and skip."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "So it's a noisy signal."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "Then we have the equivalent of the like, which is you saved it to your library."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "That's a pretty strong signal of affection."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "And then we have the more explicit signal of playlisting."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "Like you took the time to create a playlist, you put it in there."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "There's a very little small chance that if you took all that trouble, this is not a really important track to you."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "And then we understand also what are the tracks it relates to."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "So we have the playlisting, we have the like, and then we have the listening or skip."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "And you have to have very different approaches to all of them because of different levels of noise."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "One is very voluminous, but noisy, and the other is rare, but you can probably trust it."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting because I think between those signals captures all the information you'd want to capture."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "I mean, there's a feeling, a shallow feeling for me that there's sometimes that I'll hear a song that's like, yes, this is, you know, this was the right song for the moment."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "But there's really no way to express that fact except by listening through it all the way and maybe playing it again at that time or something."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "But there's no need for a button that says this was the best song I could have heard at this moment."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "Well, we're playing around with that, with kind of the thumbs up concept saying like, I really like this."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "Just kind of talking to the algorithm."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's unclear if that's the best way for humans to interact."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Maybe it is."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Maybe they should think of Spotify as a person, an agent sitting there trying to serve you and you can say like, bad Spotify, good Spotify."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "Right now, the analogy we've had is more, you shouldn't think of us."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "We should be invisible."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "And the feedback is if you save it, it's kind of you work for yourself."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "You do a playlist because you think it's great and we can learn from that."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "It's kind of back to Tesla, how they kind of have this shadow mode."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "They sit in what you drive."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "We kind of took the same analogy."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "We sit in what you playlist and then maybe we can offer you an autopilot where you can take over for a while or something like that."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "And then back off if you say like, that's not good enough."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "But I think it's interesting to figure out what your mental model is."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "If Spotify is an AI that you talk to, which I think might be a bit too abstract for many consumers, or if you still think of it as it's my music app, but it's just more helpful."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And it depends on the device it's running on, which brings us to smart speakers."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So I have a lot of the Spotify listening I do is on devices I can talk to, whether it's from Amazon, Google or Apple."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "What's the role of Spotify on those devices?"}, {"time": 4782, "text": "How do you think of it differently than on the phone or on the desktop?"}, {"time": 4787, "text": "There are a few things to say about the first of all, it's incredibly exciting."}, {"time": 4792, "text": "They're growing like crazy, especially here in the US."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "And it's solving a consumer need that I think is, you can think of it as just remote interactivity."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "You can control this thing from across the room."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And it may feel like a small thing, but it turns out that friction matters to consumers being able to say play, pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "So basically, you made the living room interactive now."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And what we see in our data is that the number one use case for these speakers is music, music and podcast."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So fortunately for us, it's been important to these companies to have those use case covered."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So they want to Spotify on this."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "We have very good relationships with them."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "And we're seeing tremendous success with them."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "What I think is interesting about them is it's already working."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "We kind of had this epiphany many years ago, back when we started using Sonos."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "If you went through all the trouble of setting up your Sonos system, you had this magical experience where you had all the music ever made in your living room."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "And we made this assumption that the home, everyone used to have a CD player at home, but they never managed to get their files working in the home."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "Having this network attached storage was too cumbersome for most consumers."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So we made the assumption that the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming books, where you would buy the steering and would have all the music built in."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "That took longer than we thought."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "But with the voice speakers, that was the unlocking that made kind of the connected speaker happen in the home."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "So it really exploded."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "And we saw this engagement that we predicted would happen."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "What I think is interesting, though, is where it's going from now."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "Right now, you think of them as voice speakers."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "But I think if you look at Google I.O., for example, they just added a camera to it, where when the alarm goes off, instead of saying, hey, Google, stop, you can just wave your hand."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "So I think they're going to think more of it as an agent or as an assistant, truly an assistant."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "And an assistant that can see you is going to be much more effective than a blind assistant."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "So I think these things will morph."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "And we won't necessarily think of them as, quote unquote, voice speakers anymore."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Just as interactive access to the Internet in the home."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "But I still think that the biggest use case for those will be audio."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "So for that reason, we're investing heavily in it."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "And we built our own NLU stack to be able to the challenge here is, how do you innovate in that world?"}, {"time": 4964, "text": "It lowers friction for consumers, but it's also much more constrained."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "You have no pixels to play with in an audio only world."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "It's really the vocabulary that is the interface."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "So we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that, trying to understand what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "And actually, you're actually nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from everything I've seen, the level of frustration people experience upon failure of natural language understanding is much higher than failure in other contexts."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "People get frustrated really fast."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "So if you screw that experience up even just a little bit, they give up really quickly."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "And I think you see that in the data."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "While it's tremendously successful, the most common interactions are play, pause and next."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "The things where if you compare it to taking up your phone, unlocking it, bringing up the app and skipping, clicking skip, it was much lower friction."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "But then for longer, more complicated things

perspective, does Spotify control that entire experience or no?"}, {"time": 5096, "text": "It seems like the NLU, the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then Spotify stays at a layer below that."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "It's a good and complicated question."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "Some of which is dependent on the on the partners."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "So it's hard

{"time": 5267, "text": "I was like, this is amazing."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "So one question I have is sort of the bigger question."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "How do you make money in this complicated world?"}, {"time": 5275, "text": "How do you deal with the relationship with record labels who are complicated?"}, {"time": 5284, "text": "These big you're essentially have the task of herding cats, but like rich and powerful powerful cats, and also have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough and still making money in the Internet space where people are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars a month."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "So how do you navigate the space?"}, {"time": 5310, "text": "How do you navigate?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "That's a beautiful description."}, {"time": 5312, "text": "Herding rich cats."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "That before."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "It is very complicated, and I think certainly actually betting against Spotify has been statistically a very smart thing to do."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Just looking at the at the line of roadkill in music streaming services, it's it's kind of I think if I understood the complexity when I joined Spotify, unfortunately, fortunately, I didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities, because then I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn't work."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So, you know, ignorance is bliss."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "But I think there have been a few distinct challenges."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "I think, as I said, one of the things that made it work at all was that Sweden and the Nordics was a lost market."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So there was no risk for labels to try this."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "I don't think it would have worked if if the market was healthy."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "So that was the initial condition."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "Then we had this tremendous challenge with the model itself."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "So now most people were pirating."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "But for the people who bought a download or a CD, the artists would get all the revenue for all the future plays then, right?"}, {"time": 5388, "text": "So you got it all up front, whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing day one, almost nothing day two."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "And then at some point, this curve of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one payment."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And that took a long time to play out before before the music labels, they understood that."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "But on the artist side, it took a lot of time to understand that actually, if I have a big hit that is going to be played for many years, this is a much better model because I get paid based on how much people use the product, not how much they thought they would use it day one or so forth."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "So it was a complicated model to get across."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "But time helped with that."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again than it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back up."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And so we're very proud of having been a part of that."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "So there have been distinct problems."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "I think when it comes to the labels, we have taken the painful approach."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "Some of our competition at the time, they kind of looked at other companies and said, if we just ignore the rights, we get really big, really fast."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "We're going to be too big for the labels to kind of, too big to fail."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "They're not going to kill us."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "We didn't take that approach."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "We went legal from day one and we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "It was very slow."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "It was very frustrating."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "We were angry at seeing other companies taking shortcuts and

though clearly there's a lot of frustrations at times during renegotiations, there is this there is this weird trust where we have been honest and fair."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "We've never screwed them."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "They've never screwed us."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "It's 10 years, but there's this trust and like they know that if music doesn't get really big, if lots of people do not want to listen to music and want to pay for it, Spotify has no business model."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "So we actually are incredibly aligned."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "Other companies, not to be tense, but other companies have other business models where even if they made no money from music, they'd still be profitable companies."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "But Spotify won't."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "So I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business wise."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "So there is this trust that allows us to do product development, even if it's scary, taking risks."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "The free model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should get credit for."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "Now, some of it was that they had nothing to lose in the game."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "Some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "But frankly, a lot of the labels also took risk."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And so I think we built up that trust with I think herding of cats sounds a bit."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "What's the word?"}, {"time": 5553, "text": "It sounds like dismissive of the cats."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Dismissive."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "No, every cat matters."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "They're all beautiful and very important."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "They've taken a lot of risks and certainly it's been frustrating."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "So it's really like playing it's game theory."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "If you play the game many times, then you can have the statistical outcome that you bet on."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "And it feels very painful when you're in the middle of that thing."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "I mean, there's risk, there's trust, there's relationships."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "From just having read the biography of Steve Jobs, similar kind of relationships were discussed in iTunes."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "The idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "And there was no, it was the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "It was trust, it was game theory as a lot of relationships that had to be built."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "And it's really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little bit because they could afford for that process to fail."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "For Spotify, it seems terrifying because you can't."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "Initially, I think a lot of it comes down to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in negotiating, which seems like an impossible task because he was completely unknown and so forth."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "But maybe that was also the reason that it worked."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "But I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "You could go straight for this Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or you play it many times, you try to actually go for the top left, the corporations sell."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "Is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have won this?"}, {"time": 5660, "text": "So a lot of people have tried to do what Spotify tried to do and Spotify has come out."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "Well, so the answer is that there's no magical reason because I don't believe in magic."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "But I think there are there are reasons."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "And I think some of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "The actual Spotify model is very complicated."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "They've looked at the premium model and said, it seems like you can charge $9.99 for music and people are going to pay, but that's not what happened."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "Actually, when we launched the original mobile product, everyone said they would never pay."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "What happened was they started on the free product and then their engagement grew so much that eventually they said, maybe it is worth $9.99, right?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "It's your propensity to pay gross with your engagement."}, {"time": 5708, "text": "So we have this super complicated business model."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "We operate two different business models, advertising and premium at the same time."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "And I think that is hard to replicate."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "I struggle to think of other companies that run large scale advertising and subscription products at the same time."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "So I think the business model is actually much more complicated than people think it is."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And so some people went after just the premium part without the free part and ran into a wall where no one wanted to pay."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "Some people went after just music should be free, just ads, which doesn't give you enough revenue and doesn't work for the music industry."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "So I think that combination is kind of opaque from the outside."}, {"time": 5746,

matter."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "It looks brilliant in retrospect."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "Let's call it brilliant."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "Yeah, when the books are written, they'll be brilliant."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "You've mentioned that your philosophy is to embrace change."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "So how will the music streaming and music listening world change over the next 10 years, 20 years?"}, {"time": 5784, "text": "You look out into the far future."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "I think that music and for that matter, audio podcasts, audiobooks, I think it's one of the few core human needs."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "I think it there is no good reason to me why it shouldn't be at the scale of something like messaging or social networking."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I don't think it's a niche thing to listen to music or news or something."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So I think scale is obviously one of the things that I really hope for."}, {"time": 5810,

it is consumed, what I'm hoping is back to this analogy of the software tool chain, where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to text messaging."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "Text messaging was also based on standards in the area of mobile carriers."}, {"time": 5848, "text": "You had the SMS, the 140 character, 120 character SMS."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And it was great because everyone agreed on the standards."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "So as a consumer, you got a lot of distributions and interoperability, but it was a very constrained format."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "And when the industry wanted to add pictures to that format to do the MMS, I looked it up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000s."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "This is like a 15, 20 year product cycle to bring pictures into that."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "Now, once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software stack within something like Snapchat or WhatsApp, the first week they added disappearing messages."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "Then two weeks later, they added stories."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "The pace of innovation when you're on one software stack and you can affect both creation and consumption, I think it's going to be rapid."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "So with these streaming services, we now, for the first time in history, have enough, I hope, people on one of these services."}, {"time": 5905, "text": "Actually, whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple or YouTube, and hopefully enough creators that you can actually start working with the format again."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "And that excites me."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "I think being able to change these constraints from 100 years, that could really do something interesting."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "I really hope it's not just going to be the iteration on the same thing for the next 10 to 20 years as well."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "Yeah, changing the creation of music, the creation of audio, the creation of podcasts is a really fascinating possibility."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "I myself don't understand what it is about podcasts that's so intimate."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "It just is."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "I listen to a lot of podcasts."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "I think it touches on a deep human need for connection that people do feel like they're connected to when they listen."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "I don't understand what the psychology of that is, but in this world that's becoming more and more disconnected, it feels like this is fulfilling a certain kind of need."}, {"time": 5964, "text": "And empowering the creator as opposed to just the listener is really interesting."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "I'm really excited that you're working on this."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "Yeah, I think one of the things that is inspiring for our teams to work on podcasts is exactly that, whether you think, like I probably do, that it's something biological about perceiving to be in the middle of the conversation that makes you listen in a different way."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "People seem to perceive it differently."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "And there was this narrative for a long time that if you look at video, everything kind of in the foreground, it got shorter and shorter and shorter because of financial pressures and monetization and so forth."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "And eventually, at the end, there's almost like 20 seconds clip, people just screaming something and I feel really good about the fact that you could have interpreted that as people have no attention span anymore."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "They don't want to listen to things."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "They're not interested in deeper stories."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "People are getting dumber."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "But then podcasts came along and it's almost like, no, no, the need still existed."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "But maybe it was the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for two hours."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "But if you can drive at the same time, it seems like people really want to dig deeper and they want to hear like the more complicated version."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "So to me, that is very inspiring that that podcast is actually long form."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "It gives me a lot of hope for humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper, more complicated conversations."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "This is I don't understand it."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "So the majority for this podcast, listen to the whole thing."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "This whole conversation we've been talking for an hour and 45 minutes."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "And somebody will I mean, most people will be listening to these words I'm speaking right now."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "You wouldn't have thought that 10 years ago with where the world seemed to go."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "That's very positive, I think."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "That's really exciting."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And empowering the

building the bricks, you're putting the bricks together to form buildings, structures, regions of the brain."}, {"time": 488, "text": "And where you make the connections between these many different type of cells, especially nerve cells, neurons, right?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "That transmit action potentials and electricity."}, {"time": 499, "text": "I've heard you also say somewhere, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, that the order of the way this builds matters."}, {"time": 506, "text": "If you are an engineer and you think about development, you can think of it as, well, I could also take all the cells and bring them all together into a brain in the end."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But development is much more than that."}, {"time": 520, "text": "So the cells are made in a very specific order that subserve the final product that you need to get."}, {"time": 527, "text": "And so, for example, all of the nerve cells, the neurons are made first, and all of the supportive cells of the neurons, like the glia, is made later."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And there is a reason for that because they have to assemble together in specific ways."}, {"time": 542, "text": "But you also may say, well, why don't we just put them all together in the end?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "It's because as they develop next to each other, they influence their own development."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So it's a different thing for a glia to be made alone in a dish, than a glia cell be made in a developing embryo with all these other cells around it that produce all these other signals."}, {"time": 563, "text": "First of all, that's mind blowing, this development process."}, {"time": 567, "text": "From my perspective in artificial intelligence, you often think of how incredible the final product is, the final product, the brain."}, {"time": 575, "text": "But you're making me realize that the final product is just, the beautiful thing is the actual development process."}, {"time": 584, "text": "Do we know the code that drives that development?"}, {"time": 592, "text": "Do we have any sense?"}, {"time": 593, "text": "First of all, thank you for saying that it's really the formation of the brain."}, {"time": 599, "text": "It's really its development."}, {"time": 600, "text": "It is this incredibly choreographed dance that happens the same way every time each one of us builds the brain, right?"}, {"time": 610, "text": "And that builds an organ that allows us to do what we're doing today, right?"}, {"time": 614, "text": "That is mind blowing."}, {"time": 616, "text": "And this is why developmental neurobiologists never get tired of studying that."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Now you're asking about the code."}, {"time": 623, "text": "What drives this?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "How is this done?"}, {"time": 626, "text": "Well, it's millions of years of evolution of really fine tuning gene expression programs that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time and to become a certain cell type, but also mechanical forces of pressure bending."}, {"time": 647, "text": "This embryo is not just, it will not stay a tube, this brain for very long."}, {"time": 652, "text": "At some point, this tube in the front of the embryo will expand to make the primordium of the brain, right?"}, {"time": 689, "text": "So it's not only chemical, it's also mechanical."}, {"time": 692, "text": "So from my perspective, biology is this incredibly complex mess, gooey mess."}, {"time": 700, "text": "So you're saying mechanical forces."}, {"time": 703, "text": "How different is like a computer or any kind of mechanical machine that we humans build and the biological systems?"}, {"time": 714, "text": "Have you been, because you've worked a lot with biological systems."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Are they as much of a mess as it seems from a perspective of an engineer, a mechanical engineer?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "Yeah, they are much more prone to taking alternative routes, right?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "It was not the environment of the brain."}, {"time": 763, "text": "Therefore, they're gonna be different just by definition."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So if you instead use development to build, let's say a brain organoid, which maybe we will be talking about in a few minutes."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Those things are fascinating."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Yes, so if you use processes of development, then when you watch it, you can see that sometimes things can go wrong in some organoids and by wrong, I mean different one organoid from the next."}, {"time": 790, "text": "While if you think about that embryo, it always goes right."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So this development, it's for as complex as it is."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Every time a baby is born has, with very few exceptions, so the brain is like the next baby, but it's not the same if you develop it in a dish."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And first of all, we don't even develop a brain, you develop something much simpler in the dish, but there are more options for building things differently, which really tells you that evolution has played a really tight game here for how in the end the brain is built in vivo."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So just a quick, maybe dumb question, but it seems like this is not, the building process is not a dictatorship."}, {"time": 841, "text": "It seems like there's not a centralized, like high level mechanism that says, okay, this cell built itself the wrong way, I'm gonna kill it."}, {"time": 851, "text": "It seems like there's a really strong distributed mechanism."}, {"time": 855, "text": "Is that in your sense for what you mean?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "There are a lot of possibilities, right?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "And if you think about, for example, different species building their brain, each brain is a little bit different."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So the brain of a lizard is very different from that of a chicken, from that of one of us and so on and so forth and still is a brain, but it was built differently starting from stem cells that pretty much had the same potential, but in the end, evolution builds different brains in different species because that serves in a way the purpose of that species and the wellbeing of that organism."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And so there are many possibilities, but then there is a way and you were talking about a code."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Nobody knows what the entire code of development is."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Of course we don't."}, {"time": 908, "text": "We know bits and pieces of very specific aspects of development of the brain, what genes are involved to make a certain cell types, how those two cells interact to make the next level structure that we might know, but the entirety of it, how it's so well controlled, it's really mind blowing."}, {"time": 926, "text": "So in the first two months in the embryo or whatever, the first few weeks, months, so yeah, the building blocks are constructed."}, {"time": 937, "text": "The actual, the different regions of the brain, I guess in the nervous system."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Well, this continues way longer than just the first few months."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So over the very first few months, you build a lot of the cells, but then there is continuous building of new cell types all the way through birth."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And then even postnatally, I don't know if you've ever heard of myelin."}, {"time": 963, "text": "Myelin is this sort of insulation that is built around the cables of the neurons so that the electricity can go really fast from."}, {"time": 972, "text": "The axons, I guess they're called."}, {"time": 973, "text": "The axons, they're called axons, exactly."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And so as human beings, we myelinate our cells postnatally."}, {"time": 984, "text": "A kid, a six year old kid has barely started the process of making the mature oligodendrocytes, which are the cells that then eventually will wrap the axons into myelin."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And this will continue, believe it or not, until we are about 25, 30 years old."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "So there is a continuous process of maturation and tweaking and additions, and also in response to what we do."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "I remember taking AP Biology in high school, and in the textbook, it said that, I'm going by memory here, that scientists disagree on the purpose of myelin in the brain."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "Is that totally wrong?"}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So like, I guess it speeds up the, okay, I might be wrong here, but I guess it speeds up the electricity traveling down the axon or something."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "Yeah, so that's the most sort of canonical, and definitely that's the case."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So you have to imagine an axon, and you can think about it as a cable of some type with electricity going through."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And what myelin does, by insulating the outside, I should say there are tracts of myelin and pieces of axons that are naked without myelin."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "And so by having the insulation, the electricity, instead of going straight through the cable, it will jump over a piece of myelin, right, to the next naked little piece and jump again."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And therefore, that's the idea that you go faster."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And it was always thought that in order to build a big brain, a big nervous system, in order to have a nervous system that can do very complex type of things, then you need a lot of myelin because you wanna go fast with this information from point A to point B."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Well, a few years ago, maybe five years ago or so, we discovered that some of the most evolved, which means the newest type of neurons that we have as nonhuman primates, as human beings in the top of our cerebral cortex, which should be the neurons that do some of the most complex things that we do, well, those have axons that have very little myelin."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "And they have very interesting ways in which they put this myelin on their axons."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "You know, a little piece here, then a long track with no myelin, another chunk there."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And some don't have myelin at all."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "So now, you have to explain where we're going with evolution."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And if you think about it, perhaps as an electrical engineer, when I looked at it, I initially thought, and I'm a developmental neurobiologist, I thought maybe this is what we see now, but if we give evolution another few million years, we'll see a lot of myelin on these neurons too."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But I actually think now that that's instead the future of the brain."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Less myelin."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Less myelin might allow for more flexibility on what you do with your axons, and therefore more complicated and unpredictable type of functions, which is also a bit mind blowing."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So it seems like it's controlling the timing of the signal."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So they're in the timing, you can encode a lot of information."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And so the brain."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "The timing, the chemistry of that little piece of axon, perhaps it's a dynamic process where the myelin can move."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "Now you see how many layers of variability you can add, and that's actually really good if you're trying to come up with a new function or a new capability or something unpredictable in a way."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So we're gonna jump around a little bit, but the old question of how much is nature and how much is nurture?"}, {"time": 1214, "text": "In terms of this incredible thing after the development is over, we seem to be kind of somewhat smart, intelligent, cognition, consciousness, all of these things are just incredible, ability to reason and so on emerge."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "In your sense, how much is in the hardware, in the nature and how much is in the nurture is learned through with our parents through interacting with the environment and so on."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It's really both, right?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "If you think about it."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "So we are born with a brain as babies that has most of its cells and most of its structures."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And that will take a few years to grow, to add more, to be better."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "But really then we have this 20 years of interacting with the environment around us."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "And so what that brain that was so perfectly built or imperfectly built due to our genetic cues will then be used to incorporate the environment in its further maturation and development."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "And so your experiences do shape your brain."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "I mean, we know that like if you and I may have had a different childhood or a different, we have been going to different schools, we have been learning different things and our brain is a little bit different because of that."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "We behave differently because of that."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And so especially postnatally experience is extremely important."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "We are born with a plastic brain."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "What that means is a brain that is able to change in response to stimuli that can be sensory."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So perhaps some of the most illuminating studies that were done were studies in which the sensory organs were not working, right?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Like if you are born with eyes that don't work, then your very brain, that piece of the brain that normally would process vision, the visual cortex, develops postnatally differently and it might be used to do something different, right?"}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So that's the most extreme."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "The plasticity of the brain, I guess, is the magic hardware that it, and then it's flexibility in all forms is what enables the learning postnatally."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Can you talk about organoids?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "What are they?"}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And how can you use them to help us understand the brain and the development of the brain?"}, {"time": 1365, "text": "This is very, very important."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So the first thing I'd like to say, please skip this in the video."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "The first thing I'd like to say is that an organoid, a brain organoid is not the same as a brain."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "It's a fundamental distinction."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "It's a system, a cellular system that one can develop in the culture dish, starting from stem cells that will mimic some aspects of the development of the brain, but not all of it."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "They are very small, maximum, they become about four to five millimeters in diameters."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "They are much simpler than our brain, of course, but yet they are the only system where we can literally watch a process of human brain development unfold."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And by watch, I mean, study it."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Remember when I told you that we can't understand everything about development in our own brain by studying a mouse?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "Well, we can't study the actual process of development of the human brain because it all happens in utero."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So we will never have access to that process ever."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And therefore, this is our next best thing."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "Like a bunch of stem cells that can be coaxed into starting a process of neural tube formation."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "Remember that tube that is made by the embryo early on."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "And from there, a lot of the cell types that are present within the brain, and you can simply watch it and study, but you can also think about diseases where development of the brain does not proceed normally, right, properly."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Think about neurodevelopmental diseases."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "There are many, many different types."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Think about autism spectrum disorders."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "There are also many different types of autism."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "So there you could take a stem cell, which really means either a sample of blood or a sample of skin from the patient, make a stem cell, and then with that stem cell, watch a process of formation of a brain organ or a brain organoid of that person with that genetics, with that genetic code in it."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And you can ask, what is this genetic code doing to some aspects of development of the brain?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And for the first time, you may come to solutions like what cells are involved in autism, right?"}, {"time": 1516, "text": "So many questions around this."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "So if you take this human stem cell for that particular person with that genetic code, how, and you try to build an organoid, how often will it look similar?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "What's the, yeah, so."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "The reproducibility?"}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Yes, or how much variability is the flip side of that?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Yeah, so there is much more variability in building organoids than there is in building brain."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's really true that the majority of us, when we are born as babies, our brains look a lot like each other."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "This is the magic that the embryo does, where it builds a brain in the context of a body and there is very little variability there."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "There is disease, of course, but in general, a little variability."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "When you build an organoid, we don't have the full code for how this is done."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And so in part, the organoid somewhat builds itself because there are some structures of the brain that the cells know how to make."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And another part comes from the investigator, the scientist adding to the media factors that we know in the mouse, for example, would foster a certain step of development, but it's very limited."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And so as a result, the kind of product you get in the end is much more reductionist, is much more simple than what you get in vivo."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "It mimics early events of development as of today, and it doesn't build very complex type of anatomy and structure does not as of today, which happens instead in vivo."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And also the variability that you see, one organ to the next tends to be higher than when you compare an embryo to the next."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So, okay, then the next question is, how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive is it to go from one stem cell to an organoid?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "How many can you build in like, because it sounds very complicated."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "It's work definitely, and it's money definitely, but you can really grow a very high number of these organoids, can go perhaps, I told you the maximum, they become about five millimeters in diameter."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So this is about the size of a tiny, tiny raisin, or perhaps the seed of an apple."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And so you can grow 50 to 100 of those inside one big bioreactors, which are these flasks where the media provides nutrients for the organoids."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "So the problem is not to grow more or less of them."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "It's really to figure out how to grow them in a way that they are more and more reproducible, for example, organoid to organoid, so they can be used to study a biological process."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "Because if you have too much variability, then you never know if what you see is just an exception or really the rule."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "So what does an organoid look like?"}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Are there different neurons already emerging?"}, {"time": 1705, "text": "Is there, well, first, can you tell me what kind of neurons are there?"}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Are they sort of all the same?"}, {"time": 1715, "text": "Are they not all the same?"}, {"time": 1718, "text": "How much do we understand?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And how much of that variance, if any, can exist in organoids?"}, {"time": 1727, "text": "So you could grow, I told you that the brain has different parts."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So the cerebral cortex is on the top part of the brain, but there is another region called the striatum that is below the cortex and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "All of these regions have different types of cells in the actual brain, okay?"}, {"time": 1745, "text": "And so scientists have been able to grow organoids that may mimic some aspects of development of these different regions of the brain."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "And so we are very interested in the cerebral cortex."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "That's the coolest part, right?"}, {"time": 1760, "text": "We wouldn't be here talking if we didn't have a cerebral cortex."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "It's also, I like to think, the part of the brain that really truly makes us human, the most evolved in recent evolution."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so in the attempt to make the cerebral cortex and by figuring out a way to have these organoids continue to grow and develop for extended periods of times, much like it happens in the real embryo, months and months in culture, then you can see that many different types of neurons of the cortex appear."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And at some point, also the astrocytes, so the glia cells of the cerebral cortex also appear."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "What are these astrocytes?"}, {"time": 1800, "text": "The astrocytes are not neurons, so they're not nerve cells, but they play very important roles."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "One important role is to support the neuron."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "But of course, they have much more active type of roles."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "They're very important, for example, to make the synapses, which are the point of contact and communication between two neurons."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "So all that chemistry fun happens in the synapses, happens because of these cells?"}, {"time": 1828, "text": "Are they the medium in which?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "It happens because of the interactions, happens because you are making the cells and they have certain properties, including the ability to make neurotransmitters, which are the chemicals that are secreted to the synapses, including the ability of making these axons grow with their growth cones and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "And then you have other cells around it that release chemicals or touch the neurons or interact with them in different ways to really foster this perfect process, in this case of synaptogenesis."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "And this does happen within organoids."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "So the mechanical and the chemical stuff happens."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "The connectivity between neurons, this in a way is not surprising because scientists have been culturing neurons forever."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "And when you take a neuron, even a very young one, and you culture it, eventually finds another cell or another neuron to talk to, it will form a synapse."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Are we talking about mice neurons?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Are we talking about human neurons?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It doesn't matter, both."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So you can culture a neuron, like a single neuron and give it a little friend and it starts interacting?"}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Yes, so neurons are able to, it sounds, it's more simple than what it may sound to you."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Neurons have molecular properties and structural properties that allow them to really communicate with other cells."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And so if you put not one neuron, but if you put several neurons together, chances are that they will form synapses with each other."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "So an organoid is not a brain."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "But there's some, it's able to, especially what you're talking about, mimics some properties of the cerebral cortex, for example."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "So what can you understand about the brain by studying an organoid of a cerebral cortex?"}, {"time": 1941, "text": "I can literally study all this incredible diversity of cell type, all

way, it's a little tiny rudimentary window into the past, into the time when that brain in a kid that had this neurodevelopmental disease was being made."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "And I think that's

little about the functional aspect of just, but how in the history of understanding the biology of the brain, the development, how far are we along?"}, {"time": 2232, "text": "And so this is just, of course, my opinion."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "I think that we did not have technology even 10 years ago or certainly not 20 years ago to even think about experimentally investigating the development of the human brain."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "So we've done a lot of work in science to study the brain or many other organisms."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "Now we have some technologies which I'll spell out that allow us to actually look at the real thing and look at the brain, at the human brain."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So what are these technologies?"}, {"time": 2266, "text": "There has been huge progress in stem cell biology."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "The moment someone figured out how to turn a skin cell into an embryonic stem cell, basically, and that how that embryonic stem cell could begin a process of development again to, for example, make a brain, there was a huge advance, and in fact, there was a Nobel Prize for that."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "That started the field, really, of using stem cells to build organs."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "Now we can build on all the knowledge of development that we build over the many, many, many years to say, how do we make the stem cells now make more and more complex aspects of development of the human brain?"}, {"time": 2305, "text": "So this field is young, the field of brain organoids, but it's moving faster."},

way, looked at with very, very high resolution, the single cell level to really understand what is going on."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "And you could do it in multiple stages of development and you can build your hypothesis and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "So it's not gonna be a thousand years."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "It's gonna be a shorter amount of time."}, {"time": 2365,

transformative that we didn't see at all in the prior thousand years."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "So I apologize for the crazy sci fi questions, but the developmental process is fascinating to watch and study, but how far are we away from and maybe how difficult is it to build not just an organoid, but a human brain from a stem cell?"}, {"time": 2402, "text": "Yeah, first of all, that's not the goal for the majority of the serious scientists that work on this because you don't have to build the whole human brain to make this model useful for understanding how the brain develops or understanding disease."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "You don't have to build the whole thing."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "So let me just comment on this, fascinating."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "It shows to me the difference between you and I as you're actually trying to understand the beauty of the human brain and to use it to really help thousands or millions of people with disease and so on, right?"}, {"time": 2438, "text": "From an artificial intelligence perspective, we're trying to build systems that we can put in robots and try to create systems that have echoes of the intelligence

2457, "text": "Science fiction, but we operate in science fiction a little bit."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "So on that point of building a brain, even though that is not the focus or interest, perhaps, of the community, how difficult is it?"}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Is it truly science fiction at this point?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "I think the field will progress, like I said, and that the system will be more and more complex in a way, right?"}, {"time": 2478, "text": "But there are properties that emerge from the human brain that have to do with the mind, that may have to do with consciousness, that may have to do with intelligence or whatever that we really don't understand even how they can emerge from an actual, real brain."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And therefore, we can now measure or study in an organoid."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "So I think that this field, many, many years from now, may lead to the building of better neural circuits that really are built out of understanding of how this process really works."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And it's hard to predict how complex this really will be."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "I really don't think we're so far from, it makes me laugh, really."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "It's really that far from building the human brain."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "But you're gonna be building something that is always a bad version of it, but that may have really powerful properties and might be able to respond to stimuli or be used in certain context."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "And this is why I really think that there is no other way to do this science, but within the right ethical framework, because where you're going with this is also, we can talk about science fiction and write that book, and we could today, but this work happens in a specific ethical framework that we don't decide just as scientists, but also as a society."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "So the ethical framework here is a fascinating one, is a complicated one."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Do you have a sense, a grasp of how we think about ethically of building organoids from human stem cells to understand the brain?"}, {"time": 2584, "text": "It seems like a tool for helping potentially millions of people cure diseases or at least start the cure by understanding it."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "But is there more, is there gray areas that we have to think about ethically?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "We must think about that."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "Every discussion about the ethics of this needs to be based on actual data from the models that we have today and from the ones that we will have tomorrow."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So it's a continuous conversation."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "It's not something that you decide now."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "Today, there is no issue really."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "Very simple models that clearly can help you in many ways without much think about, but tomorrow we need to have another conversation and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And so the way we do this is to actually really bring together constantly a group of people that are not only scientists, but also bioethicists, the lawyers, philosophers, psychiatrists and so on, psychologists and so on and so forth to decide as a society really what we should and what we should not do."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "So that's the way to think about the ethics."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Now, I also think though, that as a scientist, I have a moral responsibility."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "So if you think about how transformative it could be for understanding and curing a neuropsychiatric disease, to be able to actually watch and study and treat with drugs the very brain of the patient that you are trying to study."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "How transformative at this moment in time this could be."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "We couldn't do it five years ago, we could do it now, right?"},

from the human brain, it still is his process of brain development with his or her genetics."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "And we could understand perhaps what is going wrong."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "Perhaps we could use as a platform, as a cellular platform to screen for drugs, to fix a process and so on and so forth, right?"}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So we could do it now, we couldn't do it five years ago."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Should we not do it?"}, {"time": 2720, "text": "What is the downside of doing it?"}, {"time": 2724, "text": "I don't see a downside at this very moment."},

2739, "text": "So it's exactly perhaps what you alluded at with your question, that you are enabling some process of formation of the brain that could be misused at some point, or that could be showing properties that ethically we don't wanna see in a tissue."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "So today, I repeat, today, this is not an issue."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And so you just gain dramatically from the science without, because the system is so simple and so different in a way from the actual brain."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "But because it is the brain, we have an obligation to really consider all of this, right?"}, {"time": 2783, "text": "And again, it's a balanced conversation where we should put disease and betterment of humanity also on that plate."}, {"time": 2792,

doing."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "And again, this varies depending on what we're talking about here."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So now we're talking about brain organoids."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "I think that the scientists need to be part of that conversation about what is, will be allowed in the future or not allowed in the future to do with the system."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "And I think that is very, very important because they bring the reality of data to the conversation."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And so they should have a voice."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So data should have a

would just fundamentally alter their brain, okay?"}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Or maybe not, maybe you only, you know, it would suffice to just make some nanorobots that just measured some sort of much

how we wanna use them."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "You know, the physicists, I think, over the generations, you know, convinced people that that is an unbelievably complicated question and, you know, just give up on trying to understand it."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "I can let you in, not being a physicist, I can let you in on a secret, which is that it becomes a lot simpler if you do what we do in quantum information theory and sort of take the physics out of it."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "So the way that we think about quantum mechanics is sort of as a generalization of the rules of probability themselves."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "So, you know, you might say there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today or something."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance, right, that would be nonsense."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Much less would you say that there was, you know, an I% chance, you know, square root of minus 1% chance."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "Now, the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanics made is that fundamentally the world is described by, or, you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities for, you know, what a system could be doing are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay, which are like probabilities in some ways, but they are not probabilities."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "They can be positive."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "For one thing, they can be positive or negative."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "In fact, they can even be complex numbers."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Okay, and if you've heard of a quantum superposition, this just means some state of affairs where you assign an amplitude, one of these complex numbers, to every possible configuration that you could see a system in on measuring it."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So for example, you might say that an electron has some amplitude for being here and some other amplitude for being there, right?"}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Now, if you look to see where it is, you will localize it, right?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "You will sort of force the amplitudes to be converted into probabilities."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "That happens by taking their squared absolute value, okay, and then, you know, you can say either the electron will be here or it will be there."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And, you know, knowing the amplitudes, you can predict at least the probabilities that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?"}, {"time": 1949, "text": "But while a system is isolated from the whole rest of the universe, the rest of its environment, the amplitudes can change in time by rules that are different from the normal rules of probability and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "So anytime anyone ever tells you anything about the weirdness of the quantum world, you know, or assuming that they're not lying to you, right, they are telling you, you know, yet another consequence of nature being described by these amplitudes."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So most famously, what amplitudes can do is that they can interfere with each other, okay?"}, {"time": 1988, "text": "So in the famous double slit experiment, what happens is that you shoot a particle, like an electron, let's say, at a screen with two slits in it, and you find that there are, you know, on a second screen, now there are certain places where that electron will never end up, you know, after it passes through the first screen."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "And yet, if I close off one of the slits, then the electron can appear in that place, okay?"}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So by decreasing the number of paths that the electron could take to get somewhere, you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?"}, {"time": 2023, "text": "Now, how is that possible?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now, the electron has a superposition state, okay?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "It has some amplitude for reaching this point by going through the first slit."},

"text": "And those amplitudes, if they're pointing in different directions, they can cancel each other out."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "That would mean the total amplitude is zero and the thing never happens at all."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "I close off one of the possibilities, then the amplitude is positive or it's negative, and now the thing can happen."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "Okay, a quantum computer is a computer that tries to exploit, you know, exactly these phenomena, superposition, amplitudes, and interference, in order to solve certain problems much faster than we know how to solve them otherwise."}, {"time":

some other amplitude for being one."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "But now the key point is that if I've got, let's say, a thousand qubits, the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal that I do not just need one ampli...

computer, if I had to write down two to the one thousand complex numbers, that would not fit within the entire observable universe."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal that if these qubits can all interact with each other, and in some sense, I need two to the one thousand parameters, you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on."},

just said, and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works is just by trying every possible answer in parallel."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "You know, that sounds too good to be true, and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "The problem is I could make a superposition over every possible answer to my problem, you know, even if there are two to the one thousand of them, right?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "I can easily do that."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "The trouble is for a computer to be useful, you've got to, at some point, you've got to look at it and see an output, right?"}, {"time": 2202, "text": "And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer, then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me that all I'll see will be a random answer."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "You know, if I just wanted a random answer, well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less trouble, right?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "So the entire trick with quantum computing, with every algorithm for a quantum computer, is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference of amplitudes, and you try to do it so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading to that wrong answer have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "So on the whole, they cancel each other out, okay?"}, {"time": 2240, "text": "Whereas all the paths leading to the right answer should reinforce each other, you know, should have amplitudes pointing the same direction."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "So the design of

information."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "So just to linger on that."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "So the physical design implementation of a qubit does not interfere with the, that next level of abstraction that you can program over it."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "So it truly is, the idea of it is, okay."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "Well, to be honest with you, today they do interfere with each other."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "That's because all the quantum computers we can build today are very noisy, right?"}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And so sort of the, you know, the qubits are very far from perfect."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "And so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "And we sort of have to think about all of them at once."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Okay, but eventually where we hope to get is to what are called error corrected quantum computers, where the qubits really do behave like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "And in that future, you know, a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about or think about today."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "But in that future, the logic of it really does become decoupled from the hardware."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So if noise is currently like the biggest problem for quantum computing, and then the dream is error correcting quantum computers, can you just maybe describe what does it mean for there to be noise in the system?"}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Absolutely, so yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific than noise."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So the fundamental problem, if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer, you know, of any appreciable size, is something called decoherence."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning, you know, when people first started thinking about this in the 1990s."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Now, what decoherence means is sort of the unwanted interaction between, you know, your qubits, you know, the state of your quantum computer and the external environment."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "Okay, and why is that such a problem?"}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Well, I talked before about how, you know, when you measure a quantum system, so let's say if I measure a qubit that's in a superposition of zero and one states to ask it, you know, are you zero or are you one?"}, {"time": 2534, "text": "Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?"}, {"time": 2537, "text": "And now, probabilistically, it chooses one or the other and now, you know, it's no longer a superposition, there's no longer amplitudes, there's just, there's some probability that I get a zero and there's some that I get a one."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "And now, the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me who's looking, okay?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Or in fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "It is, you know, the state has now collapsed."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "You know, another way to say it is that it's become entangled with its environment, okay?"}, {"time": 2599, "text": "But, you know, from the perspective of someone who's just looking at this qubit, it is as though it has lost its quantum state."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And so, what this means is that if I want to do a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits sort of fanatically well isolated from their environment."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "But then at the same time, they can't be perfectly isolated because I need to tell them what to do."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "I need to make them interact with each other, for one thing, and not only that, but in a precisely choreographed way, okay?"}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And, you know, that is such a staggering problem, right?"}, {"time": 2633, "text": "How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe but then also tell them exactly what to do?"}, {"time": 2638, "text": "I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists and computer scientists in the 90s who said, this is fundamentally impossible, you know?"}, {"time": 2647, "text": "The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Now, what changed the views of most of us was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance, okay?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "And the upshot of that theory is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale it up to, you know, an arbitrary number of as many qubits as I want, you know, and doing as much on them as I want, I do not actually have to get the qubits perfectly isolated from their environment."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "It is enough to get them really, really, really well isolated, okay?"}, {"time": 2690, "text": "And even if every qubit is sort of leaking, you know, its state into the environment at some rate, as long as that rate is low enough, okay, I can sort of encode the information that I care about in very clever ways across the collective states of multiple qubits, okay?"}, {"time": 2710, "text": "In such a way that even if, you know, a small percentage of my qubits leak, well, I'm constantly monitoring them to see if that leak happened."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "I can detect it and I can correct it."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "I can recover the information I care about from the remaining qubits, okay?"}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer even out of unreliable parts, right?"}, {"time": 2732, "text": "Now, in some sense, you know, that discovery is what set the engineering agenda for quantum computing research from the 1990s until the present, okay?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "The goal has been, you know, engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable but reliable enough that you can then use these error correcting codes to have them simulate qubits that are even more reliable than they are, right?"}, {"time": 2758, "text": "The error correction becomes a net win rather than a net loss, right?"}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And then once you reach that sort of crossover point, then, you know, your simulated qubits could in turn simulate qubits that are even more reliable and so on until you've just, you know, effectively, you have arbitrarily reliable qubits."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "So long story short, we are not at that breakeven point yet."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "We're a hell of a lot closer than we were when people started doing this in the 90s, like orders of magnitude closer."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "But the key ingredient there is the more qubits, the better because... Ah, well, the more qubits, the larger the computation you can do, right?"}, {"time": 2795, "text": "I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory of your quantum computer, right?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "But also for the, sorry, for the error correcting mechanism."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "So the way I would say it is that error correction imposes an overhead in the number of qubits."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems with building a scalable quantum computer."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "If you look at the error correcting codes, at least the ones that we know about today, and you look at, you know, what would it take to actually use a quantum computer to, you know, hack your credit card number, which is, you know, maybe, you know, the most famous application people talk about, right?"}, {"time": 2833, "text": "Let's say to factor huge numbers and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "Well, what that would take would be thousands of, several thousand logical qubits."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "But now with the known error correcting codes, each of those logical qubits would need to be encoded itself using thousands of physical qubits."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So at that point, you're talking about millions of physical qubits."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "And in some sense, that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking cryptography already."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "It's because of these immense overheads involved."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?"}, {"time": 2866, "text": "Well, it's multiplicative."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits that you need in your abstract quantum circuit, you multiply it by a thousand or so."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So, you know, there's a lot of work on, you know, inventing better, trying to invent better error correcting codes."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "Okay, that is the situation right now."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "In the meantime, we are now in, what the physicist John Preskill called the noisy intermediate scale quantum or NISQ era."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "And this is the era, you can think of it as sort of like the vacuum, you know, we're now entering the very early vacuum tube era of quantum computers."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "The quantum computer analog of the transistor has not been invented yet, right?"}, {"time": 2906, "text": "That would be like true error correction, right?"}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Where,

few months ago, you know, as of Google's announcement of quantum supremacy, you know, we are now finally at the point where even with a non error corrected quantum computer, with, you know, these noisy devices, we can do something that is hard for classical computers to simulate, okay?"}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So we can eke out some advantage."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something beyond what a classical computer can do that is also useful to someone?"}, {"time": 2946, "text": "That we still don't know."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "People are

challenge?"}, {"time": 2984, "text": "Is there breakthroughs on the physics side that are needed on the computer science side?"}, {"time": 2993, "text": "Or is it a financial issue where much larger

millions of times faster and with millions of times more memory."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And I think there's been an immense economic pressure to get more and more transistors, get them smaller and smaller, add more and more cores."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "And in some sense, a huge fraction of all of the technological progress that there is in all of civilization has gotten concentrated just more narrowly into just those problems, right?"}, {"time": 3264, "text": "And so it has been one of the biggest success stories in the history of technology, right?"}, {"time": 3271, "text": "There's, I mean, it is, I am as amazed by it as anyone else is, right?"}, {"time": 3276, "text": "But at the same time, we also know that it, and I really do mean we know that it cannot continue indefinitely,

it'd be nice to replicate."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, some people are sort of, get depressed about the fact that technological progress may seem to have slowed down in many, many

Peter Thiel, yeah."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "So then jumping to another really interesting topic that you mentioned, so Google announced with their work in the paper in Nature with quantum supremacy."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "Can you describe, again, back to the basic, what is perhaps not so basic, what is quantum supremacy?"}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Absolutely, so quantum supremacy is a term that was coined by, again, by John Preskill in 2012."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "Not everyone likes the name, but it sort of stuck."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "We don't, we sort of haven't found a better alternative."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "It's technically quantum computational supremacy."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Yeah, yeah, supremacy, that's right, that's right."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "But the basic idea is actually one that goes all the way back to the beginnings of quantum computing when Richard Feynman and David Deutsch, people like that, were talking about it in the early 80s."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "And quantum supremacy just refers to sort of the point in history when you can first use a quantum computer to do some well defined task much faster than any known algorithm running on any of the classical computers that are available, okay?"}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So notice that I did not say a useful task, okay?"}, {"time": 3466, "text": "It could be something completely artificial, but it's important that the task be well defined."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "So in other words, it is something that has right and wrong answers that are knowable independently of this device, right?"}, {"time": 3480, "text": "And we can then run the device, see if it gets the right answer or not."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "Can you clarify a small point?"}, {"time": 3485, "text": "You said much faster than a classical implementation."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "What about sort of what about the space with where the class, there's no, there's not, it doesn't even exist, a classical algorithm to show the power?"}, {"time": 3498, "text": "So maybe I should clarify."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "Everything that a quantum computer can do, a classical computer can also eventually do, okay?"}, {"time": 3506, "text": "And the reason why we know that is that a classical computer could always, you know, if it had no limits of time and memory, it could always just store the entire quantum state, you know, of your, you know, of the quantum, store a list of all the amplitudes, you know, in the state of the quantum computer, and then just, you know, do some linear algebra to just update that state, right?"}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And so anything that quantum computers can do can also be done by classical computers, albeit exponentially slower in some cases."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "So quantum computers don't go into some magical place outside of Alan Turing's definition of computation."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "They do not solve the halting problem."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "They cannot solve anything that is uncomputable in Alan Turing's sense."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "What we think they do change is what is efficiently computable, okay?"}, {"time": 3587, "text": "Yeah, so I do hope we get to talk again because one of the many topics that there's probably several hours worth of conversation on is complexity, which we probably won't even get a chance to touch today, but you briefly mentioned it, but let's maybe try to continue."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "So you said the definition of quantum supremacy is basically achieving a place where much faster on a formal, that quantum computer is much faster on a formal well defined problem that is or isn't useful."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "And I would say that we really want three things, right?"}, {"time": 3625, "text": "We want, first of all, the quantum computer to be much faster just in the literal sense of like number of seconds, you know, it's a solving this, you know, well defined, you know, problem."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "Secondly, we want it to be sort of, you know, for a problem where we really believe that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior, right?"}, {"time": 3645, "text": "So it's not just an incidental, you know, matter of hardware, but it's that, you know, as you went to larger and larger inputs, you know, the classical scaling would be exponential and the scaling for the quantum algorithm would only be polynomial."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "And then thirdly, we want the first thing, the actual observed speed up to only be explainable in terms of the scaling behavior, right?"}, {"time": 3670, "text": "So, you know, I want, you know, a real world, you know, a real problem to get solved, let's say by a quantum computer with 50 qubits or so, and for no one to be able to explain that in any way other than, well, you know, this computer involved a quantum state with two to the 50th power amplitudes."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And, you know, a classical simulation, at least any that we know today, would require keeping track of two to the 50th numbers."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "And this is the reason why it was faster."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "So the intuition is that then if you demonstrate on 50 qubits, then once you get to 100 qubits, then it'll be even much more faster."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Precisely, precisely."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "Yeah, and, you know, and quantum supremacy does not require error correction, right?"}, {"time": 3717, "text": "We don't, you know, we don't have, you could say, true scalability yet or true, you know, error correction yet."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "But you could say quantum supremacy is already enough by itself to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer will never outperform a classical computer for anything."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "But one, how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy?"}, {"time": 3740, "text": "And two, what's up with these news articles I'm reading that Google did so?"}, {"time": 3745, "text": "Yeah, all right, well, great, great questions, because now you get into actually, you know, a lot of the work that I've, you know, I and my students have been doing for the last decade, which was precisely about how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy using technologies that, you know, we thought would be available in the near future."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And so one of the main things that we realized around 2011, and this was me and my student, Alex Arkhipov at MIT at the time, and independently of some others, including Bremner, Joseph, and Shepherd, okay?"}, {"time": 3786, "text": "And the realization that we came to was that if you just want to prove that a quantum computer is faster, you know, and not do something useful with it, then there are huge advantages to sort of switching your attention from problems like factoring numbers that have a single right answer to what we call sampling problems."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "So these are problems where the goal is just to output a sample from some probability distribution, let's say over strings of 50 bits, right?"}, {"time": 3818, "text": "So there are, you know, many, many, many possible valid outputs."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "You know, your computer will probably never even produce the same output twice, you know, if it's running as, even, you know, assuming it's running perfectly, okay?"}, {"time": 3832, "text": "But the key is that some outputs are supposed to be likelier than other ones."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "So, sorry, to clarify, is there a set of outputs that are valid and set they're not, or is it more that the distribution of a particular kind of output is more, is like there's a specific distribution of a particular kind of output?"}, {"time": 3854, "text": "Yeah, there's a specific distribution that you're trying to hit, right?"}, {"time": 3857, "text": "Or, you know, that you're trying to sample from."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "Now, there are a lot of questions about this, you know, how do you do that, right?"}, {"time": 3864, "text": "Now, how you do it, you know, it turns out that with a quantum computer, even with the noisy quantum computers that we have now, that we have today, what you can do is basically just apply a randomly chosen sequence of operations, right?"}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So we, you know, in some of the, you know, that part is almost trivial, right?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "We just sort of get the qubits to interact in some random way, although a sort of precisely specified random way so we can repeat the exact same random sequence of interactions again and get another sample from that same distribution."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And what this does is it basically, well, it creates a lot of garbage, but, you know, very specific garbage, right?"}, {"time": 3906, "text": "So, you know, of all of the, so we're gonna talk about Google's device that were 53 qubits there, okay?"}, {"time": 3914, "text": "And so there were two to the 53 power possible outputs."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "Now, for some of those outputs, you know, there was a little bit more destructive interference in their amplitude, okay?"}, {"time": 3925, "text": "So their amplitudes were a little bit smaller."}, {"time": 3928, "text": "And for others, there was a little more constructive interference."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "You know, the amplitudes were a little bit more aligned with each other, you know, and so those were a little bit likelier, okay?"}, {"time": 3938, "text": "All of the outputs are exponentially unlikely, but some are, let's say, two times or three times, you know, unlikelier than others, okay?"}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And so you can define, you know, this sequence of operations that gives rise to this probability distribution."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Okay, now the next question would be, well, how do you, you know, even if you're sampling from it, how do you verify that, right?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "How do you know?"}, {"time": 3964, "text": "And so my students and I, and also the people at Google were doing the experiment, came up with statistical tests that you can apply to the outputs in order to try to verify, you know, what is, you know, that at least that some hard problem is being solved."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "The test that Google ended up using was something that they called the linear cross entropy benchmark, okay?"}, {"time": 3992, "text": "And it's basically, you know, so the drawback of this test is that it requires, like, it requires you to do a two to the 53 time calculation with your classical computer, okay?"}, {"time": 4004, "text": "So it's very expensive to do the test on a classical computer."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "The good news is... How big of a number is two to the 53?"}, {"time": 4011, "text": "It's about nine quadrillion, okay?"}, {"time": 4013, "text": "That doesn't help."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "Well, you know, it's, you want it in like scientific notation."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "No, no, no, what I mean is... Yeah, it is just..."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "It's impossible to run on a... Yeah, so we will come back to that."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "It is just barely possible to run, we think, on the largest supercomputer that currently exists on Earth, which is called Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab, okay?"}, {"time": 4035, "text": "Great, this is exciting."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "That's the short answer."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "So ironically, for this type of experiment, we don't want 100 qubits, okay?"}, {"time": 4044, "text": "Because with 100 qubits, even if it works, we don't know how to verify the results, okay?"}, {"time": 4049, "text": "So we want, you know, a number of qubits that is enough that, you know, the biggest classical computers on Earth will have to sweat, you know, and we'll just barely, you know, be able to keep up with the quantum computer, you know, using much more time, but they will still be able to do it in order that we can verify the results."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "Which is where the 53 comes from for the number of qubits?"}, {"time": 4070, "text": "Basically, well, I mean, that's also, that's sort of, you know, I mean, that's sort of where they are now in terms of scaling, you know?"}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And then, you know, soon, you know, that point will be passed."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "And then when you get to larger numbers of qubits, then, you know, these types of sampling experiments will no longer be so interesting because we won't even be able to verify the results and we'll have to switch to other types of computation."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "So with the sampling thing, you know, so the test that Google applied with this linear cross entropy benchmark was basically just take the samples that were generated, which are, you know, a very small subset of all the possible samples that there are."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "But for those, you calculate with your classical computer the probabilities that they should have been output."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And you see, are those probabilities like larger than the mean?"}, {"time": 4123, "text": "You know, so is the quantum computer biased toward outputting the strings that it's, you know, that you want it to be biased toward?"}, {"time": 4130, "text": "Okay, and then finally, we come to a very crucial question, which is supposing that it does that."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "Well, how do we know that a classical computer could not have quickly done the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "How do we know that, you know, this couldn't have been spoofed by a classical computer, right?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "And so, well, the first answer is we don't know for sure because, you know, this takes us into questions of complexity theory."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "You know, I mean, questions of the magnitude of the P versus NP question and things like that, right?"}, {"time": 4160, "text": "You know, we don't know how to rule out definitively that there could be fast classical algorithms for, you know, even simulating quantum mechanics and for, you know, simulating experiments like these, but we can give some evidence against that possibility."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And that was sort of the, you know, the main thrust of a lot of the work that my colleagues and I did, you know, over the last decade, which is then sort of in around 2015 or so, what led to Google deciding to do this experiment."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So is the kind of evidence here, first of all, the hard P equals NP problem that you mentioned and the kind of evidence that you were looking at, is that something you come to on a sheet of paper or is this something, are these empirical experiments?"}, {"time": 4207, "text": "It's math for the most part."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "I mean, you know, it's also, you know, we have a bunch of methods that are known for simulating quantum circuits or quantum computations with classical computers."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "And so we have to try them all out and make sure that, you know, they don't work, you know, make sure that they have exponential scaling on, you know, these problems and not just theoretically, but with the actual range of parameters that are actually, you know, arising in Google's experiment."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "Okay, so there is an empirical component to it, right?"}, {"time": 4243, "text": "But now on the theoretical side, you know, basically what we know how to do in theoretical computer science and computational complexity is, you know, we don't know how to prove that most of the problems we care about are hard, but we know how to pass the blame to someone else, okay?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "We know how to say, well, look, you know, I can't prove that this problem is hard, but if it is easy, then all these other things that, you know, you probably were much more confident or were hard, then those would be easy as well, okay?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So we can give what are called reductions."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "This has been the basic strategy in, you know, NP completeness, right, in all of theoretical computer science and cryptography since the 1970s, really."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "And so we were able to give some reduction evidence for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments, these sampling based quantum supremacy experiments."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "So reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "One of the biggest open problems in this area is to make it better."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "But, you know, we can do something."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "You know, certainly we can say that, you know, if there is a fast classical algorithm to spoof these experiments, then it has to be very, very unlike any of the algorithms that we know."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "TREVOR Which is kind of in the same kind of space of reasoning that people say P not equals NP."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "BENJAMIN Yeah, it's in the same spirit."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "TREVOR Okay, so Andrew Yang, a very intelligent and a presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas in all kinds of technological fields, tweeted that because of quantum computing, no code is uncrackable."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "Is he wrong or right?"}, {"time": 4357, "text": "BENJAMIN He was premature, let's say."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So, well, okay, wrong."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "Look, I'm actually, you know, I'm a fan of Andrew Yang."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "I like his ideas."}, {"time": 4371,

may also be ahead of his time in that tweet that you referenced."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "So regarding using quantum computers to break cryptography, so the situation is this, okay?"}, {"time": 4393, "text": "So the famous discovery of Peter Shor, you know, 26 years ago that really started quantum computing, you know, as an autonomous field was that if you built a full scalable quantum computer, then you could use it to efficiently find the prime factors of huge numbers and calculate discrete logarithms and solve a few other problems that are very, very special in character, right?"}, {"time": 4422, "text": "They're not NP complete problems."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "We're pretty sure they're not, okay?"}, {"time": 4426, "text": "But it so happens that most of the public key cryptography that we currently use to protect the internet is based on the belief that these problems are hard."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "Okay, what Shor showed is that once you get scalable quantum computers, then that's no longer true, okay?"}, {"time": 4443, "text": "But now, you know, before people panic, there are two important points to understand here."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Okay, the first is that quantum supremacy, the milestone that Google just achieved, is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer that would be needed to actually threaten public key cryptography."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "Okay, so, you know, we touched on this earlier, right?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "But Google's device has 53 physical qubits, right?"}, {"time": 4469, "text": "To threaten cryptography, you're talking, you know, with any of the known error correction methods, you're talking millions of physical qubits."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "Because error correction would be required to threaten cryptography."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Yes, yes, yes, it certainly would, right?"}, {"time": 4486, "text": "And, you know, how much, you know, how great will the overhead be from the error correction?"}, {"time": 4493, "text": "That we don't know yet."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But with the known codes, you're talking millions of physical qubits and of a much higher quality than any that we have now, okay?"}, {"time": 4530, "text": "So this brings me to the second point I wanted to make, which is that there are other public key cryptosystems that are known that we don't know how to break even with quantum computers, okay?"}, {"time": 4545, "text": "And so there's a whole field devoted to this now, which is called post quantum cryptography, okay?"}, {"time": 4551, "text": "And so there is already, so we have some good candidates now."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "The best known being what are called lattice based cryptosystems."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "And there is already some push to try to migrate to these cryptosystems."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "So NIST in the US is holding a competition to create standards for post quantum cryptography, which will be the first step in trying to get every web browser and every router to upgrade, you know, and use, you know, something like SSL that would be based on, you know, what we think is quantum secure cryptography."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "But, you know, this will be a long process."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "But, you know, it is something that people are already starting to do."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "And so, you know, I'm sure this algorithm is sort of a dramatic discovery."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "You know, it could be a big deal for whatever intelligence agency first gets a scalable quantum computer, if no, at least certainly if no one else knows that they have it, right?"}, {"time": 4613, "text": "But eventually we think that we could migrate the internet to the post quantum cryptography and then we'd be more or less back where we started."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "Okay, so this is sort of not the application of quantum computing."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "I think that's really gonna change the world in a sustainable way, right?"}, {"time": 4630, "text": "The big, by the way, the biggest practical application of quantum computing that we know about by far, I think is simply the simulation of quantum mechanics itself."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "In order to, you know, learn about chemical reactions, you know, design maybe new chemical processes, new materials, new drugs, new solar cells, new superconductors, all kinds of things like that."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "What's the size of a quantum computer that would be able to simulate the, you know, quantum mechanical systems themselves that would be impactful for the real world for the kind of chemical reactions and that kind of work?"}, {"time": 4670, "text": "What scale are we talking about?"}, {"time": 4671, "text": "Now you're asking a very, very current question, a very big question."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do useful quantum simulations even with, you know, 100 or 200 qubit quantum computers of the sort that we expect to be able to build over the next decade."}, {"time": 4692, "text": "Okay, so that might be, you know, the first application of quantum computing that we're able to realize, you know, or maybe it will prove to be too difficult and maybe even that will require fault tolerance or, you know, will require error correction."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So there's an aggressive race to come up with the one case study kind of like Peter Schor with the idea that would just capture the world's imagination of like, look, we can actually do something very useful here."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "Right, but I think, you know, within the next decade, the best shot we have is certainly not, you know, using Schor's algorithm to break cryptography, you know, just because it requires, you know, too much in the way of error correction."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "The best shot we have is to do some quantum simulation that tells the material scientists or chemists or nuclear physicists, you know, something that is useful to them and that they didn't already know, you know, and you might only need one or two successes in order to change some, you know, billion dollar industries, right?"}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Like, you know, the way that people make fertilizer right now is still based on the Haber Bosch process from a century ago."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "And it is some many body quantum mechanics problem that no one really understands, right?"}, {"time": 4767, "text": "If you could design a better way to make fertilizer, right?"}, {"time": 4770, "text": "That's, you know, billions of dollars right there."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "So those are sort of the applications that people are going to be aggressively racing toward over the next decade."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "Now, I don't know if they're gonna realize it or not, but, you know, they certainly at least have a shot."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "So it's gonna be a very, very interesting next decade."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "But just to clarify, what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 4791, "text": "If a breakthrough like that comes with, is it possible for that breakthrough to be on 50 to 100 qubits or is scale a fundamental thing like 500, 1000 plus qubits?"}, {"time": 4804, "text": "Yeah, so I can tell you what the current studies are saying."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "You know, I think probably better to rely on that than on my intuition."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "But, you know, there was a group at Microsoft had a study a few years ago that said even with only about 100 qubits, you know, you could already learn something new about the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer, for example."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "The trouble is they're talking about 100 qubits and about a million layers of quantum gates."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "Okay, so basically they're talking about 100 nearly perfect qubits."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "So the logical qubits, as you mentioned before."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "Yeah, exactly, 100 logical qubits."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "And now, you know, the hard part for the next decade is gonna be, well, what can we do with 100 to 200 noisy qubits?"}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Yeah, is there error correction breakthroughs that might come without the need to do thousands or millions of physical qubits?"}, {"time": 4864, "text": "Yeah, so people are gonna be pushing simultaneously on a bunch of different directions."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "One direction, of course, is just making the qubits better, right?"}, {"time": 4874, "text": "And, you know, there is tremendous progress there."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "I mean, you know, the fidelity is like the accuracy of the qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude, you know, in the last decade or two."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "Okay, the second thing is designing better error, you know, let's say lower overhead error correcting codes and even short of doing the full recursive error correction."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "You know, there are these error mitigation strategies that you can use, you know, that may, you know, allow you to eke out a useful speed up in the near term."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "And then the third thing is just taking the quantum algorithms for simulating quantum chemistry or materials and making them more efficient."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "You know, and those algorithms are already dramatically more efficient than they were, let's say, five years ago."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And so when, you know, I quoted these estimates like, you know, circuit depth of one million."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "And so, you know, I hope that because people will care enough that these numbers are gonna come down."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So you're one of the world class researchers in this space."}, {"time": 4944, "text":

the natural, just like in the AI space, the natural charlatanism, if that's a word in this, in the quantum mechanics in general, but quantum computers and so on."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "Can you give some notes about people or ideas that people like me or listeners in general from outside the field should be cautious of when they're taking in news headings that Google achieved quantum supremacy?"}, {"time": 4999, "text": "So what should we look out for?"}, {"time": 5001, "text": "Where's the charlatans in the space?"}, {"time": 5003, "text": "Where's the BS?"}, {"time": 5003, "text": "Yeah, so good question."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "Unfortunately, quantum computing is a little bit like cryptocurrency or deep learning."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Like there is a core of something that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "And because of that core, it attracts this sort of vast penumbra of people making just utterly ridiculous claims."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "And so with quantum computing, I mean, I would say that the main way that people go astray is by not focusing on sort of the question of, are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?"}, {"time": 5043, "text": "And so people have like dismissed quantum supremacy because it's not useful, right?"}, {"time": 5050, "text": "Or it's not itself, let's say, obviously useful for anything."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Okay, but ironically, these are some of the same people who will go and say, well, we care about useful applications."}, {"time": 5061,

do this, a quantum computer can do that."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "A quantum computer can do that, right?"}, {"time": 5092, "text": "And they just avoid the question, are you getting a speed up over

quantum computer, we have known of only modest speed ups that you can get for these problems, okay?"}, {"time": 5146, "text": "So there is a famous quantum algorithm called Grover's algorithm, okay?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "And what it can do is it can solve many, many of the problems that arise in AI, machine learning, optimization, including NP complete problems, okay?"}, {"time": 5160,

is important, it's impressive."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "It is not an exponential speed up, okay?"}, {"time": 5175, "text": "So it is not the kind of game changer that let's say Shor's algorithm for factoring is, or for that matter that simulation of quantum mechanics is, okay, it is a more modest speed up."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "And let's say roughly, in theory, it could roughly double the size of the optimization problems that you could handle, right?"}, {"time": 5193, "text": "And so because people found that I guess too boring or too unimpressive, they've gone on to like invent all of these heuristic algorithms where because no one really understands them, you can just project your hopes onto them, right?"}, {"time": 5212, "text": "That, well, maybe it gets an exponential speed up."}, {"time": 5215, "text": "You can't prove that it doesn't, and the burden is on you to prove that it doesn't get a speed up, right?"}, {"time": 5220, "text": "And so they've done an immense amount of that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "And a really worrying amount of the case for building a quantum computer has come to rest on this stuff that those of us in this field know perfectly well is on extremely shaky foundations."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "So the fundamental question is, show that there's a speed up over the classical."}, {"time": 5244, "text": "And in this space that you're referring to, which is actually really interesting, it's the area that a lot of people excited about is machine learning."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "So your sense is, do you think it will, I know that there's a lot of smoke currently, but do you think there actually eventually might be breakthroughs where you do get exponential speed ups in the machine learning space?"}, {"time":

2485, "text": "How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "I say, well,

the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know?"}, {"time": 2537, "text": "So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it."}, {"time": 2562, "text":

real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right?"}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer."},

defending advertising."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "It's

actually kind of not utilized at all."}, {"time": 501, "text": "You know, there's like recreational people kind of fly every now and then, but it's very few."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Like if you look up in the sky, you may not see any of them at any given time, every now and then you'll see one airplane kind of utilizing that space and you'll be surprised."}, {"time": 514, "text": "And the moment you're outside of an airport a little bit, like it just kind of flies off and then it goes out."}, {"time": 519, "text": "And I think utilizing that airspace, the technical challenges there is, you know, building an autonomy and ensuring that that kind of autonomy is safe."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Ultimately, I think it is going to be building in complex software or complicated so that it's maybe a few orders of magnitude more complicated than what we have on aircraft today."}, {"time": 545, "text": "And at the same time, ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft, ensuring that it's safe."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And so that becomes like building that kind of complicated hardware and software becomes a challenge, especially when, you know, you build that hardware, I mean, you build that software with data."}, {"time": 562, "text": "And so, you know, it's, of course there's some rule based software in there that kind of do a certain set of things, but then, you know, there's a lot of training there."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Do you think machine learning will be key to these kinds of, to delivering safe vehicles in the future, especially flight?"}, {"time": 580, "text": "Not maybe the safe part, but I think the intelligent part."}, {"time": 583, "text": "I mean, there are certain things that we do it with machine learning and it's just, there's like right now, no other way."}, {"time": 590, "text": "And I don't know how else they could be done."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And you know, there's always this conundrum, I mean, we could like, could we like, we could maybe gather billions of programmers, humans who program perception algorithms that detect things in the sky and whatever, or, you know, we, I don't know, we maybe even have robots like learn in a simulation environment and transfer."}, {"time": 617, "text": "And they might be learning a lot better in a simulation environment than a billion humans put their brains together and try to program."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Humans pretty limited."}, {"time": 626, "text": "So what's, what's the role of simulations with drones?"}, {"time": 630, "text": "You've done quite a bit of work there."}, {"time": 632, "text": "How promising, just the very thing you said just now, how promising is the possibility of training and developing a safe flying robot in simulation and deploying it and having that work pretty well in the real world?"}, {"time": 648, "text": "I think that, you know, a lot of people, when they hear simulation, they will focus on training immediately."}, {"time": 654, "text": "But I think one thing that you said, which was interesting, it's developing."}, {"time": 657, "text": "I think simulation environments are actually could be key and great for development."}, {"time": 661, "text": "And that's not new."}, {"time": 663, "text": "Like for example, you know, there's people in the automotive industry have been using dynamic simulation for like decades now."}, {"time": 672, "text": "And it's pretty standard that, you know, you would build and you would simulate."}, {"time": 676, "text": "If you want to build an embedded controller, you plug that kind of embedded computer into another computer, that other computer would simulate dynamic and so on."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And I think, you know, fast forward these things, you can create pretty crazy simulation environments."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Like for instance, one of the things that has happened recently and that, you know, we can do now is that we can simulate cameras a lot better than we used to simulate them."}, {"time": 699, "text": "We were able to simulate them before."}, {"time": 701, "text": "And that's, I think we just hit the elbow on that kind of improvement."}, {"time": 705, "text": "I would imagine that with improvements in hardware, especially, and with improvements in machine learning, I think that we would get to a point where we can simulate cameras very, very well."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Simulate cameras means simulate how a real camera would see the real world."}, {"time": 723, "text": "Therefore you can explore the limitations of that."}, {"time": 727, "text": "You can train perception algorithms on that in simulation, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 734, "text": "So, you know, it's, it's, it has been easier to simulate what we would call introspective sensors like internal sensors."}, {"time": 740, "text": "So for example, inertial sensing has been easy to simulate."}, {"time": 744, "text": "It has also been easy to simulate dynamics, like physics that are governed by ordinary differential equations."}, {"time": 750, "text": "I mean, like how a car goes around, maybe how it rolls on the road, how it interacts with the road, or even an aircraft flying around, like the dynamic physics of that."}, {"time": 760, "text": "What has been really hard has been to simulate extra septive sensors, sensors that kind of like look out from the vehicle."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And that's a new thing that's coming like laser range finders that are a little bit easier."}, {"time": 773, "text": "Because radars are a little bit tougher."}, {"time": 776, "text": "I think once we nail that down, the next challenge I think in simulation will be to simulate human behavior."}, {"time": 783, "text": "That's also extremely hard."}, {"time": 785, "text": "Even when you imagine like how a human driven car would act around, even that is hard."}, {"time": 792, "text": "But imagine trying to simulate, you know, a model of a human just doing a bunch of gestures and so on."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And you know, it's, it's actually simulated."}, {"time": 800, "text": "It's not captured like with motion capture, but it is simulated."}, {"time": 804, "text": "In fact, today I get involved a lot with like sort of this kind of very high end rendering projects and I have like this test that I pass it to my friends or my mom, you know, I send like two photos, two kind of pictures and I say rendered, which one is rendered, which one is real."}, {"time": 820, "text": "And it's pretty hard to distinguish, except I realized, except when we put humans in there, it's possible that our brains are trained in a way that we recognize humans extremely well."}, {"time": 831, "text": "We don't so much recognize the built environments because built environments sort of came after per se we evolved into sort of being humans, but humans were always there."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Same thing happens, for example, you look at like monkeys and you can't distinguish one from another, but they sort of do."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And it's very possible that they look at humans."}, {"time": 848, "text": "It's kind of pretty hard to distinguish one from another, but we do."}, {"time": 852, "text": "And so our eyes are pretty well trained to look at humans and understand if something is off, we will get it."}, {"time": 858, "text": "We may not be able to pinpoint it."}, {"time": 859, "text": "So in my typical friend test or mom test, what would happen is that we'd put like a human walking in anything and they say, you know, this is not right."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Something is off in this video."}, {"time": 871, "text": "I don't know what, but I can tell you it's the human."}, {"time": 874, "text": "I can take the human and I can show you like inside of a building or like an apartment and it will look like if we had time to render it, it will look great."}, {"time": 882, "text": "And this should be no surprise."}, {"time": 883, "text": "A lot of movies that people are watching, it's all computer generated."}, {"time": 887, "text": "You know, even nowadays, even you watch a drama movie and like, there's nothing going on action wise, but it turns out it's kind of like cheaper, I guess, to render the background."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And so they would."}, {"time": 897, "text": "But how do we get there?"}, {"time": 899, "text": "How do we get a human that's would pass the mom slash friend test, a simulation of a human walking?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "So do you think that's something we can creep up to by just doing kind of a comparison learning where you have humans annotate what's more realistic and not just by watching, like what's the path?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "Cause it seems totally mysterious how we simulate human behavior."}, {"time": 929, "text": "It's hard because a lot of the other things that I mentioned to you, including simulating cameras, right?"}, {"time": 935, "text": "It is, the thing there is that, you know, we know the physics, we know how it works like in the real world and we can write some rules and we can do that."}, {"time": 946, "text": "Like for example, simulating cameras, there's this thing called ray tracing."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I mean, you literally just kind of imagine it's very similar to, it's not exactly the same, but it's very similar to tracing photon by photon."}, {"time": 957, "text": "They're going around, bouncing on things and come into your eye, but human behavior, developing a dynamic, like a model of that, that is mathematical so that you can put it into a processor that would go through that, that's going to be hard."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And so what else do you got?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "You can collect data, right?"}, {"time": 977, "text": "And you can try to match the data."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Or another thing that you can do is that, you know, you can show the friend test, you know, you can say this or that and this or that, and that will be labeling."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Anything that requires human labeling, ultimately we're limited by the number of humans that, you know, we have available at our disposal and the things that they can do, you know, they have to do a lot of other things than also labeling this data."}, {"time": 999, "text": "So that modeling human behavior part is, is I think going, we're going to realize it's very tough."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And I think that also affects, you know, our development of autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "I see them in self driving as well."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "Like you want to use, so you're building self driving, you know, at the first time, like right after urban challenge, I think everybody focused on localization, mapping and localization, you know, slam algorithms came in, Google was just doing that."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And so building these HD maps, basically that's about knowing where you are."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "And then five years later in 2012, 2013 came the kind of coding code AI revolution."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And that started telling us where everybody else is, but we're still missing what everybody else is going to do next."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And so you want to know where you are."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "You want to know what everybody else is."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Hopefully you know that what you're going to do next, and then you want to predict what other people are going to do."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And that last bit has, has been a real, real challenge."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "What do you think is the role, your own of your, of your, the ego vehicle, the robot, the you, the robotic you in controlling and having some control of how the future unrolls of what's going to happen in the future."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "That seems to be a little bit ignored in trying to predict the future is how you yourself can affect that future by being either aggressive or less aggressive or signaling in some kind of way."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So this kind of game theoretic dance seems to be ignored for the moment."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "It's yeah, it's, it's totally ignored."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "I mean, it's, it's quite interesting actually, like how we how we interact with things versus we interact with humans."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Like so if, if you see a vehicle that's completely empty and it's trying to do something, all of a sudden it becomes a thing."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So interacted with like you interact with this table and so you can throw your backpack or you can kick your, kick it, put your feet on it and things like that."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "But when it's a human, there's all kinds of ways of interacting with a human."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "So if you know, like you and I are face to face, we're very civil."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "You know, we talk, we understand each other for the most part."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "We'll see you just, you never know what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "But the thing is that like, for example, you and I might interact through YouTube comments and, you know, the conversation may go at a totally different angle."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And so I think people kind of abusing as autonomous vehicles is a real issue in some sense."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And so when you're an ego vehicle, you're trying to, you know, coordinate your way, make your way, it's actually kind of harder than being a human."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "You know, it's like, it's you, you, you not only need to be as smart as, as kind of humans are, but you also, you're a thing."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So they're going to abuse you a little bit."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So you need to make sure that you can get around and do something."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So I, in general, believe in that sort of game theoretic aspects."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I've actually personally have done, you know, quite a few papers, both on that kind of game theory and also like this, this kind of understanding people's social value orientation, for example, you know, some people are aggressive, some people not so much."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "And, and, you know, like a robot could understand that by just looking at how people drive."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And as they kind of come in approach, you can actually understand, like if someone is going to be aggressive or, or not as a robot and you can make certain decisions."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "Well, in terms of predicting what they're going to do, the hard question is you as a robot, should you be aggressive or not when faced with an aggressive robot?"}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Right now it seems like aggressive is a very dangerous thing to do because it's costly from a societal perspective, how you're perceived."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "People are not very accepting of aggressive robots in modern society."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "I think that's accurate."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "So that is really is."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And so I'm not entirely sure like how to have to go about, but I know, I know for a fact that how these robots interact with other people in there is going to be, and then interaction is always going to be there."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "I mean, you could be interacting with other vehicles or other just people kind of like walking around."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And like I said, the moment there's like nobody in the seat, it's like an empty thing just rolling off the street."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "It becomes like no different than like any other thing that's not human."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "And so people, and maybe abuse is the wrong word, but people maybe rightfully even they feel like this is a human present environment designed for humans to be, and they kind of they want to own it."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And then the robots, they would need to understand it and they would need to respond in a certain way."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And I think that this actually opens up like quite a few interesting societal questions for us as we deploy, like we talk robots at large scale."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So what would happen when we try to deploy robots at large scale, I think is that we can design systems in a way that they're very efficient or we can design them that they're very sustainable, but ultimately the sustainability efficiency trade offs, like they're going to be right in there and we're going to have to make some choices."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Like we're not going to be able to just kind of put it aside."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So for example, we can be very aggressive and we can reduce transportation delays, increase capacity of transportation, or we can be a lot nicer and allow other people to kind of quote unquote own the environment and live in a nice place and then efficiency will drop."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "So when you think about it, I think sustainability gets attached to energy consumption or environmental impact immediately."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "And those are there, but like livability is another sustainability impact."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So you create an environment that people want to live in."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And if, if, if robots are going around being aggressive and you don't want to live in that environment, maybe, however, you should note that if you're not being aggressive, then, you know, you're probably taking up some, some delays in transportation and this and that."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So you're always balancing that."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "And I think this, this choice has always been there in transportation, but I think the more autonomy comes in, the more explicit the choice becomes."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And when it becomes explicit, then we can start to optimize it and then we'll get to ask the very difficult societal questions of what do we value more, efficiency or sustainability?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "It's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I think we're going to have to like, I think that the interesting thing about like the whole autonomous vehicles question, I think is also kind of, um, I think a lot of times, you know, we have, we have focused on technology development, like hundreds of years and you know, the products somehow followed and then, you know, we got to make these choices and things like that."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So this is, this is a good time that, you know, we even think about, you know, autonomous taxi type of deployments and the systems that would evolve from there."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And you realize the business models are different."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "The impact on architecture is different, urban planning, you get into like regulations, um, and then you get into like these issues that you didn't think about before, but like sustainability and ethics is like right in the middle of it."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "I mean, even testing autonomous vehicles, like think about it, you're testing autonomous vehicles in human present environments."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "I mean, uh, the risk may be very small, but still, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's, it's a, you know, strictly greater than zero risk that you're putting people into."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And so then you have that innovation, you know, risk trade off that you're, you're in that somewhere."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "Um, and we, we understand that pretty now that pretty well now is that if we don't test the, at least the, the development will be slower."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I mean, it doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to develop."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "I think it's going to be pretty hard actually."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Maybe we can, we don't, we don't, I don't know."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "But the thing is that those kinds of trade offs we already are making and as these systems become more ubiquitous, I think those trade offs will just really hit."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So you are one of the founders of Optimus Ride and autonomous vehicle company."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "We'll talk about it, but let me on that point ask maybe a good examples, keeping Optimus Ride out, out of this question, uh, sort of exemplars of different strategies on the spectrum of innovation and safety or caution."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So like Waymo, Google self driving car Waymo represents maybe a more cautious approach."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And then you have Tesla on the other side headed by Elon Musk that represents a more, however, which adjective you want to use, aggressive, innovative, I don't know."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But uh, what, what do you think about the difference in the two strategies in your view?"}, {"time": 1521, "text": "What's more likely, what's needed and is more likely to succeed in the short term and in the long term?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Definitely some sort of a balance is, is kind of the right way to go."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "But I do think that the thing that is the most important is actually like an informed public."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "So I don't, I don't mind, you know, I personally, like if I were in some place, I wouldn't mind so much like taking a certain amount of risk, um, some other people might."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And so I think the key is for people to be informed and so that they can, ideally they can make a choice."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "In some cases, that kind of choice, um, making that unanimously is of course very hard."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "But I don't think it's actually that hard to inform people."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "So I think in, in, in one case, like for example, even the Tesla approach, um, I don't know, it's hard to judge how informed it is, but it is somewhat informed."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "I mean, you know, things kind of come out."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "I think people know what they're taking and things like that and so on."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "But I think the, the underlying, um, I do think that these two companies are a little bit kind of representing like the, of course they, you know, one of them seems a bit safer or the other one, or, you know, um, whatever the objective for that is, and the other one seems more aggressive or whatever the objective for that is."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "But, but I think, you know, when you turn the tables, they're actually, there are two other orthogonal dimensions that these two are focusing on."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "On the one hand for Waymo, I can see that, you know, they're, I mean, um, they, I think they a little bit see it as research as well."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "So they kind of, they don't, I'm not sure if they're like really interested in like an immediate, um, product, um, you know, they, they talk about it."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "Um, sometimes there's some pressure to talk about it."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So they, they kind of go for it, but I think, um, I think that they're thinking, um, maybe in the back of their minds, maybe they don't put it this way, but I think they, they realize that we're building like a new engine."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "It's kind of like call it the AI engine or whatever that is."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And you know, an autonomous vehicles is a very interesting embodiment of that engine that allows you to understand where the ego vehicle is, the ego thing is where everything else is, what everything else is going to do and how do you react, how do you actually, you know, interact with humans the right way?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "How do you build these systems?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And I think, uh, they, they want to know that they want to understand that."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And so they keep going and doing that."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And so on the other dimension, Tesla is doing something interesting."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "I mean, I think that they have a good product."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "People use it."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "I think that, you know, like it's, it's not for me, um, but I can totally see people, people like it and, and people, I think they have a good product outside of automation, but I was just referring to the, the, the automation itself."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I mean, you know, like it, it kind of drives itself."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "You still have to be kind of, um, you still have to pay attention to it, right?"}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Well, you know, um, people seem to use it."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "So it works for something."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "And so people, I think people are willing to pay for it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "People are willing to buy it."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "I think it, uh, it's, it's one of the other reasons why people buy a Tesla car."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk is the CEO and you know, he seems like a visionary person."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "That's what people think."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "He's a great person."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And so that adds like 5k to the value of the car and then maybe another 5k is the autopilot and, and you know, it's, it's useful."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "I mean, it's, um, useful in the sense that like people are using it."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And so I can see Tesla and sure, of course they want to be visionary."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "They want to kind of put out a certain approach and they may actually get there."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "Um, but I think that there's also a primary benefit of doing all these updates and rolling it out because, you know, people pay for it and it's, it's, you know, it's basic, you know, demand, supply market and people like it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "They're happy to pay another 5k, 10k for that novelty or whatever that is, um, they, and they use it."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "It's not like they get it and they try it a couple of times as a novelty, but they use it a lot of the time."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And so I think that's what Tesla is doing."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "It's actually pretty different."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Like they, they are on pretty orthogonal dimensions of what kind of things that they're building."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "They are using the same AI engine."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "So it's very possible that, you know, they're both going to be, um, sort of one day, um, kind of using a similar, almost like an internal internal combustion engine."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "It's a very bad metaphor, but similar internal combustion engine, and maybe one of them is building like a car."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "The other one is building a truck or something."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So ultimately the use case is very different."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "So you, like I said, are one of the founders of Optimus, right?"}, {"time": 1788, "text": "Let's take a step back."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "That's one of the success stories in the autonomous vehicle space."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "It's a great autonomous vehicle company."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Let's go from the very beginning."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "What does it take to start an autonomous vehicle company?"}, {"time": 1802, "text": "How do you go from idea to deploying vehicles like you are in a few, a bunch of places, including New York?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "I would say that I think that, you know, what happened to us is it was, was the following."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I think, um, we realized a lot of kind of talk in the autonomous vehicle industry back in like 2014, even when we wanted to kind of get started."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "Um, and, and I don't know, like I, I kind of, I would hear things like fully autonomous vehicles, two years from now, three years from now, I kind of never bought it."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "Um, you know, I was a part of, um, MIT's urban challenge entry."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Um, it kind of like, it has an interesting history."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So, um, I did in, in, in college and in high school, sort of a lot of mathematically oriented work."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "I mean, I kind of, you know, at some point, uh, it kind of hit me."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "I wanted to build something."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And so I came to MIT's mechanical engineering program and I now realize, I think my advisor hired me because I could do like really good math, but I told him that, no, no, no, I want to work on that urban challenge car."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "I want to build the autonomous car."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And I think that was, that was kind of like a process where we really learned, I mean, what the challenges are and what kind of limitations are we up against, you know, like having the limitations of computers or understanding human behavior, there's so many of these things."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And I think it just kind of didn't."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And so, so we said, Hey, you know, like, why don't we take a more like a market based approach?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So we focus on a certain kind of market and we build a system for that."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "What we're building is not so much of like an autonomous vehicle only, I would say."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "So we build full autonomy into the vehicles."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "But, you know, the way we kind of see it is that we think that the approach should actually involve humans operating them, not just, just not sitting in the vehicle."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And I think today, what we have is today, we have one person operate one vehicle, no matter what that vehicle, it could be a forklift, it could be a truck, it could be a car, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "And we want to go from that to 10 people operate 50 vehicles."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "If you're referring to a world of maybe perhaps teleoperation, so can you just say what it means for 10?"}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It might be confusing for people listening."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "What does it mean for 10 people to control 50 vehicles?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "That's a good point."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "So I think it's, I very deliberately didn't call it teleoperation because what people think then is that people think, away from the vehicle sits a person, sees like maybe puts on goggles or something, VR and drives the car."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "So that's not at all what we mean, but we mean the kind of intelligence whereby humans are in control, except in certain places, the vehicles can execute on their own."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And so imagine like, like a room where people can see what the other vehicles are doing and everything."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "And you know, there will be some people who are more like, more like air traffic controllers, call them like AV controllers."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "And so these AV controllers would actually see kind of like a whole map and they would understand where vehicles are really confident and where they kind of need a little bit more help."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And the help shouldn't be for safety."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Help should be for efficiency."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "Vehicles should be safe no matter what."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "If you had zero people, they could be very safe, but they'd be going five miles an hour."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "And so if you want them to go around 25 miles an hour, then you need people to come in and, and for example, you know, the vehicle come to an intersection and the vehicle can say, you know, I can wait."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "I can inch forward a little bit, show my intent, or I can turn left."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And right now it's clear I can turn, I know that, but before you give me the go, I won't."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And so that's one example."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "This doesn't mean necessarily we're doing that actually."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "I think, I think if you go down all the, all that much detail that every intersection you're kind of expecting a person to press a button, then I don't think you'll get the efficiency benefits you want."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "You need to be able to kind of go around and be able to do these things."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "But, but I think you need people to be able to set high level behavior to vehicles."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "That's the other thing with autonomous vehicles, you know, I think a lot of people kind of think about it as follows."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "I mean, this happens with technology a lot."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "You know, you think, all right, so I know about cars and I heard robots."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So I think how this is going to work out is that I'm going to buy a car, press a button and it's going to drive itself."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And when is that going to happen?"}, {"time": 2071, "text": "You know, and people kind of tend to think about it that way, but when you think about what really happens is that something comes in in a way that you didn't even expect."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "If asked, you might have said, I don't think I need that, or I don't think it should be that and so on."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And then, and then that, that becomes the next big thing, coding code."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And so I think that this kind of different ways of humans operating vehicles could be really powerful."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "I think that sooner than later, we might open our eyes up to a world in which you go around walk in a mall and there's a bunch of security robots that are exactly operated in this way."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "You go into a factory or a warehouse, there's a whole bunch of robots that are playing exactly in this way."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "You go to a, you go to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, you see a whole bunch of autonomous vehicles, Optimus Ride, and they're operated maybe in this way."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "But I think people kind of don't see that."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "I sincerely think that there's a possibility that we may almost see like a whole mushrooming of this technology in all kinds of places that we didn't expect before."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And that may be the real surprise."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And then one day when your car actually drives itself, it may not be all that much of a surprise at all because you see it all the time."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "You interact with them, you take the Optimus Ride, hopefully that's your choice."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And then you hear a bunch of things, you go around, you interact with them."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Like you have a little delivery vehicle that goes around the sidewalks and delivers you things and then you take it, it says thank you."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And then you get used to that and one day your car actually drives itself and the regulation goes by and you can hit the button of sleep and it wouldn't be a surprise at all."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "I think that may be the real reality."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So there's going to be a bunch of applications that pop up around autonomous vehicles, some of which, maybe many of which we don't expect at all."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So if we look at Optimus Ride, what do you think, you know, the viral application, the one that like really works for people in mobility, what do you think Optimus Ride will connect with in the near future first?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "I think that the first places that I like to target honestly is like these places where transportation is required within an environment, like people typically call it geofence."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "So you can imagine like roughly two mile by two mile could be bigger, could be smaller type of an environment."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And there's a lot of these kinds of environments that are typically transportation deprived."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "The Brooklyn Navy Yard that, you know, we're in today, we're in a few different places, but that was the one that was last publicized and that's a good example."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So there's not a lot of transportation there and you wouldn't expect like, I don't know, I think maybe operating an Uber there ends up being sort of a little too expensive or when you compare it with operating Uber elsewhere, elsewhere becomes the priority and these places become totally transportation deprived."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And then what happens is that, you know, people drive into these places and to go from point A to point B inside this place within that day, they use their cars."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "And so we end up building more parking for them to, for example, take their cars and go to the lunch place."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "And I think that one of the things that can be done is that, you know, you can put in efficient, safe, sustainable transportation systems into these types of places first."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And I think that, you know, you could deliver mobility in an affordable way, affordable, accessible, you know, sustainable way."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "But I think what also enables is that this kind of effort, money, area, land that we spend on parking, you could reclaim some of that."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And that is on the order of like, even for a small environment like two mile by two mile, it doesn't have to be smack in the middle of New York."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "I mean, anywhere else you're talking tens of millions of dollars."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "If you're smack in the middle of New York, you're looking at billions of dollars of savings just by doing that."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And that's the economic part of it."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "And there's a societal part, right?"}, {"time": 2311, "text": "I mean, just look around."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "I mean the places that we live are like built for cars."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "It didn't look like this just like a hundred years ago, like today, no one walks in the middle of the street."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "It's for cars."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "No one tells you that growing up, but you grow into that reality."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "And so sometimes they close the road."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "It happens here, you know, like the celebration, they close the road."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "Still people don't walk in the middle of the road, like just walk in the middle and people don't."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "But I think it has so much impact, the car in the space that we have."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And I think we talked about sustainability, livability."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "I mean, ultimately these kinds of places that parking spots at the very least could change into something more useful or maybe just like park areas, recreational."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "And so I think that's the first thing that we're targeting."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And I think that we're getting like a really good response, both from an economic societal point of view, especially places that are a little bit forward looking."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And like, for example, Brooklyn Navy Yard, they have tenants."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "There's distinct direct call like new lab."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "It's kind of like an innovation center."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "There's a bunch of startups there."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "And so, you know, you get those kinds of people and, you know, they're really interested in sort of making that environment more livable."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "And these kinds of solutions that Optimus Ride provides almost kind of comes in and becomes that."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And many of these places that are transportation deprived, you know, they have, they actually rent shuttles."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "And so, you know, you can ask anybody, the shuttle experience is like terrible."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "People hate shuttles."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Because, you know, like the driver is very expensive in a shuttle business."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "So what makes sense is to attach 20, 30 seats to a driver."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And a lot of people have this misconception."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "They think that shuttles should be big."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Sometimes we get that at Optimus Ride."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "We tell them, we're going to give you like four seaters, six seaters."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And we get asked like, how about like 20 seaters?"}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I'm like, you know, you don't need 20 seaters."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "You want to split up those seats so that they can travel faster and the transportation delays would go down."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "That's what you want."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "If you make it big, not only you will get delays in transportation, but you won't have an agile vehicle."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "It will take a long time to speed up, slow down and so on."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "You need to climb up to the thing."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So it's kind of like really hard to interact with."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And scheduling too, perhaps when you have more smaller vehicles, it becomes closer to Uber where you can actually get a personal, I mean, just the logistics of getting the vehicle to you becomes easier when you have a giant shuttle."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "There's fewer of them and it probably goes on a route, a specific route that is supposed to hit."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "And when you go on a specific route and all seats travel together versus, you know, you have a whole bunch of them."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "You can imagine the route you can still have, but you can imagine you split up the seats and instead of, you know, them traveling, like, I don't know, a mile apart, they could be like, you know, half a mile apart if you split them into two."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "That basically would mean that your delays, when you go out, you won't wait for them for a long time."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And that's one of the main reasons, or you don't have to climb up."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "The other thing is that I think if you split them up in a nice way, and if you can actually know where people are going to be somehow, you don't even need the app."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "A lot of people ask us the app, we say, why don't you just walk into the vehicle?"}, {"time": 2510, "text": "How about you just walk into the vehicle, it recognizes who you are and it gives you a bunch of options of places that you go and you just kind of go there."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "I mean, people kind of also internalize the apps."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "Everybody needs an app."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "It's like, you don't need an app."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "You just walk into the thing."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "But I think one of the things that, you know, we really try to do is to take that shuttle experience that no one likes and tilt it into something that everybody loves."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And so I think that's another important thing."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "I would like to say that carefully, just like teleoperation, like we don't do shuttles."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "You know, we're really kind of thinking of this as a system or a network that we're designing."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "But ultimately, we go to places that would normally rent a shuttle service that people wouldn't like as much and we want to tilt it into something that people love."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "So you've mentioned this earlier, but how many Optimus ride vehicles do you think would be needed for any person in Boston or New York, if they step outside, there will be, this is like a mathematical question, there'll be two Optimus ride vehicles within line of sight."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Is that the right number to, well, at least one."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "For example, that's the density."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So meaning that if you see one vehicle, you look around, you see another one too."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Imagine like, you know, Tesla would tell you they collect a lot of data."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Do you see that with Tesla?"}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Like you just walk around and you look around, you see Tesla?"}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Very specific areas of California, maybe."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "Like there's a couple of zip codes that, you know, but I think that's kind of important because you know, like maybe the couple of zip codes, the one thing that we kind of depend on and I'll get to your question in a second, but now like we're taking a lot of tensions today."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "And so I think that this is actually important."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "People call this data density or data velocity."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "So it's very good to collect data in a way that, you know, you see the same place so many times."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Like you can drive 10,000 miles around the country or you drive 10,000 miles in a confined environment."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "You'll see the same intersection hundreds of times."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And when it comes to predicting what people are going to do in that specific intersection, you become really good at it versus if you draw in like 10,000 miles around the country, you've seen that only once."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And so trying to predict what people do becomes hard."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And I think that, you know, you said what is needed, it's tens of thousands of vehicles."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "You know, you really need to be like a specific fractional vehicle."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Like for example, in good times in Singapore, you can go and you can just grab a cab and they are like, you know, 10%, 20% of traffic, those taxis."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Ultimately that's where you need to get to."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "So that, you know, you get to a certain place where you really, the benefits really kick off in like orders of magnitude type of a point."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "But once you get there, you actually get the benefits."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And you can certainly carry people."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "I think that's one of the things people really don't like to wait for themselves."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "But for example, they can wait a lot more for the goods if they order something."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "Like you're sitting at home and you want to wait half an hour."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "That sounds great."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "People will say it's great."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "You want to, you're going to take a cab, you're waiting half an hour."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Like that's crazy."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "You don't want to wait that much."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "But I think, you know, you can, I think really get to a point where the system at peak times really focuses on kind of transporting humans around."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And then it's really, it's a good fraction of the traffic to the point where, you know, you go, you look around and there's something there and you just kind of basically get in there and it's already waiting for you or something like that."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And then you take it."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "If you do it at that scale, like today, for instance, Uber, if you talk to a driver, right?"}, {"time": 2735, "text": "I mean, Uber takes a certain cut."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "It's a small cut."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Or drivers would argue that it's a large cut, but you know, it's when you look at the grand scheme of things, most of that money that you pay Uber kind of goes to the driver."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "And if you talk to the driver, the driver will claim that most of it is their time."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "You know, it's not spent on gas."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "They think it's not spent on the car per se as much."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "It's like their time."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And if you didn't have a person driving, or if you're in a scenario where, you know, like 0.1 person is driving the car, a fraction of a person is kind of operating the car because you know, you want to operate several."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "If you're in that situation, you realize that the internal combustion engine type of cars are very inefficient."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "You know, we build them to go on highways, they pass crash tests."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "They're like really heavy."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "They really don't need to be like 25 times the weight of its passengers or, you know, like area wise and so on."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "But if you get through those inefficiencies and if you really build like urban cars and things like that, I think the economics really starts to check out."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Like to the point where, I mean, I don't know, you may be able to get into a car and it may be less than a dollar to go from A to B."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "As long as you don't change your destination, you just pay 99 cents and go there."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "If you share it, if you take another stop somewhere, it becomes a lot better."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "You know, these kinds of things, at least for models, at least for mathematics and theory, they start to really check out."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So I think it's really exciting what Optimus Ride is doing in terms of it feels the most reachable, like it'll actually be here and have an impact."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Yeah, that is the idea."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And if we contrast that, again, we'll go back to our old friends, Waymo and Tesla."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "So Waymo seems to have sort of technically similar approaches as Optimus Ride, but a different, they're not as interested as having impact today."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And then Tesla is like the complete opposite, which is, you know, the entirety of the world actually is going to be automated."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Highway driving, urban driving, every kind of driving, you know, you kind of creep up to it by incrementally improving the capabilities of the autopilot system."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "So when you contrast all of these, and on top of that, let me throw a question that nobody likes, but is a timeline."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "When do you think each of these approaches, loosely speaking, nobody can predict the future, will see mass deployment?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So Elon Musk predicts the craziest approach is, I've heard figures like at the end of this year, right?"}, {"time": 2938, "text": "So that's probably wildly inaccurate, but how wildly inaccurate is it?"}, {"time": 2946, "text": "I mean, first thing to lay out, like everybody else, it's really hard to guess."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "I mean, I don't know where Tesla can look at or Elon Musk can look at and say, hey, you know, it's the end of this year."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "I mean, I don't know what you can look at."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "You know, even the data that, I mean, if you look at the data, even kind of trying to extrapolate the end state without knowing what exactly is going to go, especially for like a machine learning approach."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "I mean, it's just kind of very hard to predict."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "But I do think the following does happen."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "I think a lot of people, you know, what they do is that there's something that I called a couple times time dilation in technology prediction happens."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Let me try to describe a little bit."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "There's a lot of things that are so far ahead, people think they're close."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "And there's a lot of things that are actually close."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "People think it's far ahead."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "People try to kind of look at a whole landscape of technology development, admittedly, it's chaos."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "Anything can happen in any order at any time."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "And there's a whole bunch of things in there."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "People take it, clamp it, and put it into the next three years."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And so then what happens is that there's some things that maybe can happen by the end of the year or next year and so on."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "And they push that into like few years ahead, because it's just hard to explain."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "And there are things that are like, we're looking at 20 years more, maybe, you know, hopefully in my lifetime type of things, because, you know, we don't know."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "I mean, we don't know how hard it is even."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Like that's a problem."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "We don't know like if some of these problems are actually AI complete, like, we have no idea what's going on."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And you know, we take all of that and then we clump it."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And then we say three years from now."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "And then some of us are more optimistic."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So they're shooting at the end of the year and some of us are more realistic."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "They say like five years, but you know, we all, I think it's just hard to know."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "And I think trying to predict like products ahead two, three years, it's hard to know in the following sense."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "You know, like we typically say, okay, this is a technology company, but sometimes, sometimes really you're trying to build something where the technology does, like there's a technology gap, you know, like, and Tesla had that with electric vehicles, you know, like when they first started, they would look at a chart much like a Moore's law type of chart."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "And they would just kind of extrapolate that out and they'd say, we want to be here."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "What's the technology to get that?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "It goes like this."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "We're just going to, you know, keep going with AI that goes into the cars."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "We don't even have that."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "Like we don't, we can't, I mean, what can you quantify, like what kind of chart are you looking at?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "But so, but so I think when there's that technology gap, it's just kind of really hard to predict."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So now I realize I talked like five minutes and avoid your question."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "I didn't tell you anything about that and it was very skillfully done."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "That was very well done."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And I don't think you, I think you've actually argued that it's not a use, even any answer you provide now is not that useful."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "It's going to be very hard."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "There's one thing that I really believe in and, um, and you know, this is not my idea and it's been, you know, discussed several times, but, but this, um, this, this kind of like something like a startup, um, or, or a kind of an innovative company, um, including definitely may one, may Waymo, Tesla, maybe even some of the other big companies that are kind of trying things."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "This kind of like iterated learning is very important."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "The fact that we're over there and we're trying things and so on, I think that's, um, that that's important."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "We try to understand."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And, and I think that, you know, the code in code Silicon Valley has done that with business models pretty well."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "And now I think we're trying to get to do it, but there's a literal technology gap."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "I mean, before, like, you know, you're trying to build, I'm not trying to, you know, I think these companies are building great technology to, for example, enable internet search to do it so quickly."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And that kind of didn't, didn't, wasn't there so much, but at least like it was a kind of a technology that you could predict to some degree and so on."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "And now we're just kind of trying to build, you know, things that it's kind of hard to quantify what kind of a metric are we looking at?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "So psychologically as a sort of a, as a leader of graduate students and at Optimus ride a bunch of brilliant engineers, just curiosity, psychologically, do you think it's good to think that, you know, whatever technology gap we're talking about can be closed by the end of the year or do you, you know, cause we don't know."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So the way, do you want to say that everything is going to improve exponentially to yourself and to others around you as a leader, or do you want to be more sort of maybe not cynical, but I don't want to use realistic cause it's hard to predict, but yeah, maybe more cynical, pessimistic about the ability to close that gap."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "I think that, you know, going back, I think that iterated learning is like key that, you know, you're out there, you're running experiments to learn."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And that doesn't mean sort of like, you know, like, like your Optimus ride, you're kind of doing something, but like in an environment, but like what Tesla is doing, I think is also kind of like this, this kind of notion."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "And, and, you know, people can go around and say like, you know, this year, next year, the other year and so on."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "But, but I think that the nice thing about it is that they're out there, they're pushing this technology in."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "I think what they should do more of, I think that kind of informed people about what kind of technology that they're providing, you know, the good and the bad."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "I think they're kind of go out there and they, they do great things."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "They do their own kind of experiment."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "I think we do our own and I think we're closing some similar technology gaps, but some also some are orthogonal as well."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "You know, I think like, like we talked about, you know, people being remote, like it's something or in the kind of environments that we're in or think about a Tesla car, maybe, maybe you can enable it one day."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "Like there's, you know, low traffic, like you're kind of the stop on go motion, you just hit the button and the, you can release, or maybe there's another lane that you can pass into, you go in that."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "I think they can enable these kinds of, I believe it."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And so I think that that part, that is really important and that is really key."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "And beyond that, I think, you know, when is it exactly going to happen and, and, and so on."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "I mean it's like I said, it's very hard to predict."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And I would, I would imagine that it would be good to do some sort of like a, like a one or two year plan when it's a little bit more predictable that, you know, the technology gaps you close and, and the, and the kind of sort of product that would ensue."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "So I know that from Optimus ride or, you know, other companies that I get involved in."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "I mean, at some point you find yourself in a situation where you're trying to build a product and, and people are investing in that, in that, you know, building effort and those investors that they do want to know as they compare the investments they want to make, they do want to know what happens in the next one or two years."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And I think that's good to communicate that."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "But I think beyond that, it becomes, it becomes a vision that we want to get to someday and saying five years, 10 years, I don't think it means anything."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But iterative learning is key to do and learn."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "I think that is key."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "You know, I got to sort of throw back right at you criticism in terms of, you know, like Tesla or somebody communicating, you know, how someone works and so on."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "I got a chance to visit Optimus ride and you guys are doing some awesome stuff and yet the internet doesn't know about it."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "So you should also communicate more showing off, you know, showing off some of the awesome stuff, the stuff that works and stuff that doesn't work."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "I mean, it's just the stuff I saw with the tracking of different objects and pedestrians."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "So I mean, incredible stuff going on there."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "Maybe it's just the nerd in me, but I think the world would love to see that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "That's, that's well taken."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Um, you know, I, I should say that it's not like, you know, we, we, we weren't able to, I think we made a decision at some point, um, that decision did involve me quite a bit on kind of, um, uh, sort of doing this in kind of coding code stealth mode for a bit."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Um, but I think that, you know, we'll, we'll open it up quite a lot more."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "And I think that we are also at Optimus ride kind of hitting, um, when you have new era, um, you know, we're, we're, we're big now, we're doing a lot of interesting things and I think, you know, some of the deployments that we've kind of announced were some of the first bits, bits of, um, information that we kind of put out into the world."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "We'll also put out our technology, a lot of the things that we've been developing is really amazing."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And then, you know, we're, we're gonna, we're gonna start putting that out now."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "We're especially interested in sort of like, um, being able to work with the best people."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And I think, and I think it's, it's good to not just kind of show them when they come to our office for an interview, but just put it out there in terms of like, you know, get people excited about what we're doing."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "So on the autonomous vehicle space, let me ask one last question."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So Elon Musk famously said that lighter is a crutch."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "So I've talked to a bunch of people about it, got to ask you, you use that crutch quite a bit in the DARPA days."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "So, uh, uh, you know, and his, his idea in general, sort of, you know, more provocative and fun, I think than a technical discussion, but the idea is that camera based, primarily camera based systems is going to be what defines the future of autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "So what do you think of this idea?"}, {"time": 3556, "text": "Lighter is a crutch versus primarily, uh, camera based systems."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "First things first, I think, you know, I'm a big believer in just camera based autonomous vehicle systems."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Um, I think that, you know, you can put in a lot of autonomy and, and you can do great things."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "And, and it's, it's, it's very possible that at the time scales, like I said, we can't predict 20 years from now, like you may be able to do, do things that we're doing today only with LIDAR and then you may be able to do them just with cameras."}, {"time": 3588, "text": "And I think that, um, you know, you, you can just, um, I, I, I think that I will put my name on it too."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "You know, there will be a time when you can only use cameras and you'll be fine."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "Um, at that time though, it's very possible that, you know, you find the LIDAR system as another robustifier or, or it's so affordable that it's stupid not to, you know, just kind of put it there."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And I think, um, and I think we may be looking at a future like that."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "You think we're over relying on LIDAR right now, because we understand the better it's more reliable in many ways in terms of, from a safety perspective."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "It's easier to build with."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "That's the other, that's the other thing."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "I think to be very frank with you, I mean, um, you know, we've seen a lot of sort of autonomous vehicles companies come and go and the approach has been, you know, you slap a LIDAR on a car and it's kind of easy to build with when you have a LIDAR, you know, you just kind of code it up and, and you hit the button and you do a demo."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So I think there's admittedly, there's a lot of people, they focus on the LIDAR cause it's easier to build with."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "That doesn't mean that, you know, without the camera, just cameras, you can, uh, you cannot do what they're doing, but it's just kind of a lot harder."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "And so you need to have certain kinds of expertise to exploit that."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "What we believe in and, you know, you may be seeing some of it is that, um, we believe in computer vision."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "We certainly work on computer vision and Optimus ride, uh, by a lot, like, um, and, and we've been doing that from day one."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "And we also believe in sensor fusion."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So, you know, we, we do, we have a relatively minimal use of LIDARs, but, but we do use them."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "And I think, you know, in the future, I really believe that the following sequence of events may happen."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "First things first, number one, there may be a future in which, you know, there's like cars with LIDARs and everything and the cameras, but you know, this in this 50 year ahead future, they can just drive with cameras as well."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "Especially in some isolated environments and cameras, they go and they do the thing in the same future."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "And if you don't put the LIDAR, it's a more expensive system because you have to put in a lot of compute."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "Like, this is another possibility."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "Um, I do think that a lot of the, um, sort of initial deployments of self driving vehicles, I think they will involve LIDARs and especially either low range or short, um, either short range or low resolution LIDARs are actually not that hard to build in solid state."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "Uh, they're still scanning, but like MEMS type of scanning LIDARs and things like that, they're like, they're actually not that hard."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "I think they will maybe kind of playing with the spectrum and the phase arrays that they're a little bit harder, but, but I think, um, like, you know, putting a MEMS mirror in there that kind of scans the environment, it's not hard."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "The only thing is that, you know, you, just like with a lot of the things that we do nowadays in developing technology, you hit fundamental limits of the universe, um, the speed of light becomes a problem in when you're trying to scan the environment."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "So you don't get either good resolution or you don't get range."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "Um, but, but you know, it's still, it's something that you can put in there affordably."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So let me jump back to, uh, drones."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "You've, uh, you have a role in the Lockheed Martin Alpha Pilot Innovation Challenge."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "Where, uh, teams compete in drone racing and super cool, super intense, interesting application of AI."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "So can you tell me about the very basics of the challenge and where you fit in, what your thoughts are on this problem?"}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And it's sort of echoes of the early DARPA challenge in the, through the desert that we're seeing now, now with drone racing."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "I mean, one interesting thing about it is that, you know, people, the drone racing exists as an eSport."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And so it's much like you're playing a game, but there's a real drone going in an environment."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "A human being is controlling it with goggles on."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So there's no, it is a robot, but there's no AI."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "There's no AI."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Human being is controlling it."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "And so that's already there."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "And, um, and I've been interested in this problem for quite a while, actually, um, from a roboticist point of view."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And that's what's happening in Alpha Pilot, which, which problem of aggressive flight of aggressive flight, fully autonomous, aggressive flight."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Um, the problem that I'm interested, I mean, you asked about Alpha Pilot and I'll, I'll get there in a second, but the problem that I'm interested in, I'd love to build autonomous vehicles like, like drones that can go far faster than any human possibly can."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "I think we should recognize that we as humans have, you know, limitations in how fast we can process information."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "And those are some biological limitations."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "Like we think about this AI this way too."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I mean, this has been discussed a lot and this is not sort of my idea per se, but a lot of people kind of think about human level AI and they think that, you know, AI is not human level."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "One day it'll be human level and humans and AI's, they kind of interact."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "Um, versus I think that the situation really is that humans are at a certain place and AI keeps improving and at some point it just crosses off and then, you know, it gets smarter and smarter and smarter."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And so drone racing, the same issue."}, {"time": 3924, "text": "Just play this game and you know, you have to like react in milliseconds and there's really, you know, you see something with your eyes and then that information just flows through your brain, into your hands so that you can command it."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "And there's some also delays on, you know, getting information back and forth, but suppose those delays didn't exist."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "You just, just the delay between your eye and your fingers is a delay that a robot doesn't have to have."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "Um, so we end up building in my research group, like systems that, you know, see things at a kilohertz, like a human eye would barely hit a hundred Hertz."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "So imagine things that see stuff in slow motion, like 10 X slow motion."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Um, it will be very useful."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Like we talked a lot about autonomous cars."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So, um, you know, we don't get to see it, but a hundred lives are lost every day, just in the United States on traffic accidents."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "And many of them are like known cases, you know, like the, uh, you're coming through like, uh, like a ramp going into a highway, you hit somebody and you're off, or, you know, like you kind of get confused."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "You try to like swerve into the next lane, you go off the road and you crash, whatever."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "And um, I think if you had enough compute in a car and a very fast camera right at the time of an accident, you could use all compute you have, like you could shut down the infotainment system and use that kind of computing resources instead of rendering, you use it for the kind of artificial intelligence that goes in there, the autonomy."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "And you can, you can either take control of the car and bring it to a full stop."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "But even, even if you can't do that, you can deliver what the human is trying to do."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "Human is trying to change the lane, but goes off the road, not being able to do that with motor skills and the eyes."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "And you know, you can get in there and I was, there's so many other things that you can enable with what I would call high throughput computing."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "You know, data is coming in extremely fast and in real time you have to process it."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "And the current CPUs, however fast you clock it are typically not enough."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "You need to build those computers from the ground up so that they can ingest all that data that I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "Just on that point, just really quick is the currently what's the bottom, like you mentioned the delays in humans, is it the hardware?"}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So you work a lot with Nvidia hardware."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "Is it the hardware or is it the software?"}, {"time": 4072, "text": "In fact, they need to be co developed I think in the future."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "I mean, that's a little bit what Nvidia does sort of like they almost like build the hardware and then they build the neural networks and then they build the hardware back and the neural networks back and it goes back and forth, but it's that co design."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And I think that, you know, like we try to way back, we try to build a fast drone that could use a camera image to like track what's moving in order to find where it is in the world."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "This typical sort of, you know, visual inertial state estimation problems that we would solve."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And you know, we just kind of realized that we're at the limit sometimes of, you know, doing simple tasks."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "We're at the limit of the camera frame rate because you know, if you really want to track things, you want the camera image to be 90% kind of like, or some somewhat the same from one frame to the next."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And why are we at the limit of the camera frame rate?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "It's because camera captures data."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "It puts it into some serial connection."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "It could be USB or like there's something called camera serial interface that we use a lot."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "It puts into some serial connection and copper wires can only transmit so much data."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And you hit the channel limit on copper wires and you know, you, you hit yet another kind of universal limit that you can transfer the data."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So you have to be much more intelligent on how you capture those pixels."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "You can take compute and put it right next to the pixels."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "People are building those."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "How hard is it to do?"}, {"time": 4158, "text": "How hard is it to get past the bottleneck of the copper wire?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "Yeah, you need to, you need to do a lot of parallel processing, as you can imagine."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "The same thing happens in the GPUs, you know, like the data is transferred in parallel somehow."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "It gets into some parallel processing."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "I think that, you know, like now we're really kind of diverted off into so many different dimensions, but."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "So it's aggressive flight."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "How do we make drones see many more frames a second in order to enable aggressive flight?"}, {"time": 4186, "text": "That's a super interesting problem."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "That's an interesting problem."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So, but like, think about it."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "You have, you have CPUs."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "You clock them at, you know, several gigahertz."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "We don't clock them faster, largely because, you know, we run into some heating issues and things like that."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "But the whole thing is that three gigahertz clock light travels kind of like on the order of a few inches or an inch."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "That's the size of a chip."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "And so you pass a clock cycle and as the clock signal is going around in the chip, you pass another one."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And so trying to coordinate that, the design of the complexity of the chip becomes so hard."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "I mean, we have hit the fundamental limits of the universe in so many things that we're designing."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "I don't know if people realize that."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "Like, we can't make transistors smaller because like quantum effects, the electrons start to tunnel around."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "We can't clock it faster."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "One of the reasons why is because like information doesn't travel faster in the universe and we're limited by that."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Same thing with the laser scanner."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "But so then it becomes clear that, you know, the way you organize the chip into a CPU or even a GPU, you now need to look at how to redesign that."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "If you're going to stick with Silicon, you could go do other things too."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "I mean, there's that too, but you really almost need to take those transistors, put them in a different way so that the information travels on those transistors in a different way, in a much more way that is specific to the high speed cameras coming in."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "And so that's one of the things that we talk about quite a bit."}, {"time":

light it."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "You go through the gate and a human looks at it and just said, what just happened?"}, {"time": 4359, "text": "And they would say, it's impossible for me to do that."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And that's closing the same technology gap that would, you know, one day steer cars out of accidents."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "So that let me ask about the the the Alpha pilot challenge is a, I guess, a big prize potentially associated with it."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "But let me ask, reminiscent of the DARPA days, predictions, you think anybody will finish?"}, {"time": 4416, "text": "Well, not, not soon."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "I think that depends on how you set up the race course."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And so if the race course is a solo course, I think people will kind of do it."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "But can you set up some course, like literally some core, you get to design it is the algorithm developer, can you set up some course, so that you can be the best human?"}, {"time": 4438, "text": "When is that going to happen?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "Like that's not very easy, even just setting up some course, if you let the human that you're competing with set up the course, it becomes a lot easier, a lot harder."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So how many in the space of all possible courses are, would humans win and

"text": "What was really hard?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "I think, I think we understand, we understood what we wanted to build, but still building things, that experimentation, that iterated learning, that takes up a lot of time actually."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "And so in my group, for example, in order for us to be able to develop fast, we build like VR environments, we'll take an aircraft, we'll put it in a motion capture room, big, huge motion capture room, and we'll fly it in real time, we'll render other images and beam it back to the drone."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "That sounds kind of notionally simple, but it's actually hard because now you're trying to fit all that data through the air into the drone."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "And so you need to do a few crazy

fact, I think maybe the viewers may kind of like to see things that crash."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "That potentially could be the most exciting part."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "It could be the exciting part."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "And I think as an engineer, it's a very different situation to be in."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "Like in academia, a lot of my colleagues who are actually in this race and they're really great researchers, but I've seen them trying to do similar things whereby they built this one drone and somebody with like a face mask and a gloves are going right behind the drone."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "They're trying to hold it."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "If it falls down, imagine you don't have to do that."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "I think that's one of the nice things about Alpha Pilot Challenge where we have these drones and we're going to design the courses in a way that we'll keep pushing people up until the crashes start to happen."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "And we'll hopefully sort of, I don't think you want to tell people crashing is okay."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "Like we want to be careful here, but because we don't want people to crash a lot, but certainly we want them to push it so that everybody crashes once or twice and they're really pushing it to their limits."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "That's where iterated learning comes in, because every crash is a lesson."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "Is a lesson."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "So in terms of the space of possible courses, how do you think about it in the war of humans versus machines, where do machines win?"}, {"time": 4607, "text": "We look at that quite a bit."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "I mean, I think that you will see quickly that you can design a course and in certain courses like in the middle somewhere, if you kind of run through the course once, the machine gets beaten pretty much consistently by slightly."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "But if you go through the course like 10 times, humans get beaten very slightly, but consistently."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So humans at some point, you get confused, you get tired and things like that versus this machine is just executing the same line of code tirelessly, just going back to the beginning and doing the same thing exactly."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "I think that kind of thing happens and I

right?"}, {"time": 936, "text": "Is this mortality a critical thing here?"}, {"time": 936, "text": "I think here again, like the animal analogy is really useful because you're also allowed to shoot your dog, but people won't be happy about it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So we give, we do give animals certain protections from like, you're not allowed to torture your dog and set it on fire, at

about robots replacing humans and oh, if people get sex robots and the sex is really good, then they won't want their, you know, partner or whatever."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "But we rarely talk about robots actually filling a hole where there's nothing and what benefit that can provide to people."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Yeah, I think that's an exciting, there's a whole giant, there's a giant hole that's unfillable by humans."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It's asking too much of your, of people, your friends and people you're in a relationship with in your family to fill that hole."},

there's anything there?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Well, I think you're right that it does have something to teach us because, but I think what people are forgetting in all of these conversations is the origins of the trolley problem and what it was meant to show us, which is that there is no right answer."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And that sometimes our moral intuition that comes to us instinctively is not actually what we should follow if we care about creating systematic rules that apply to everyone."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So I think that as a philosophical concept, it could

1548, "text": "But if we're viewing the moral machine project as what we can learn from the trolley problems, the moral machine is, I'm sure you're familiar, it's this website that you can go to and

another human being?"}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Because that changes certain control decisions that you make."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So if your life matters more than other human beings, then

difficult ethical question."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Do you have a hope that like the trolley problem is not supposed to have a right answer, right?"}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Do you hope that when we have robots at the table, we'll be able to discover the right answer for some of these questions?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "Well, what's happening right now, I think, is this question that we're facing of what ethical rules should we be programming into the machines is revealing to us that our ethical rules are much less programmable than we probably thought before."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "And so that's a really valuable insight, I think, that these issues are very complicated and that in a lot of these cases, it's you can't really make that call, like not even as a legislator."},

you mean when it's like, should I run over a robot or a person?"}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So what, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So when you, it's exactly what you said, which is when you have to encode the ethics into an algorithm, you start to try to really understand what are the fundamentals of the decision making process you make to make certain decisions."}, {"time": 1768,

of what is right and what is wrong under our current societal standards."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "But isn't that what's happening right now?"}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And we're realizing that we don't have a consensus on what's right and wrong."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "You mean in politics in general?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Well, like when we're thinking about these trolley problems and autonomous vehicles and how to program ethics into machines and how to, you know, make AI algorithms fair and equitable, we're realizing that this is so complicated and it's complicated in part because there doesn't seem to be a one right answer in any of these cases."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Do you have a hope for, like one of the ideas of the moral machine is that crowdsourcing can help us converge towards, like democracy can help us converge towards the right answer."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Do you have a hope for crowdsourcing?"}, {"time": 1843, "text": "Well, yes and no."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So I think that in general, you know, I have a legal background and policymaking is often about trying to suss out, you know, what rules does this particular society agree on and then trying to codify that."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "So the law makes these choices all the time and then tries to adapt according to changing culture."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "But in the case of the moral machine project, I don't think that people's choices on that website necessarily reflect what laws they would want in place."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "I think you would have to ask them a series of different questions in order to get at what their consensus is."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "I agree, but that has to do more with the artificial nature of, I mean, they're showing some cute icons on a screen."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "That's almost, so if you, for example, we do a lot of work in virtual reality."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "And so if you put those same people into virtual reality where they have to make that decision, their decision would be very different, I think."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "I agree with that."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "That's one aspect."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And the other aspect is it's a different question to ask someone, would you run over the homeless person or the doctor in this scene?"}, {"time": 1907, "text": "Or do you want cars to always run over the homeless people?"}, {"time": 1917, "text": "I think, yeah."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So let's talk about anthropomorphism."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "To me, anthropomorphism, if I

general."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Can you step back and define anthropomorphism, how you see it in general terms in your work?"}, {"time": 1945, "text": "So anthropomorphism is this tendency that we have to project human like traits and behaviors and qualities onto nonhumans."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And we often see it with animals, like we'll project emotions on animals that may or may not actually be there."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "We often see that we're trying to interpret things according to our own behavior when we get it wrong."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "But we do it with more

the human?"}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And do you see it being used that way often?"}, {"time": 1988, "text": "Like, I don't, I haven't seen, whether it's Alexa or any of the smart speaker systems,

from that."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "I think they're afraid of that."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "They actually, so I only recently found out, but did you know that Amazon has like a whole team of people who are just there to work on Alexa's personality?"}, {"time": 2024, "text": "So I know that depends on what you mean by personality."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "I didn't know that exact thing."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "But I do know that how the voice is perceived is worked on a lot, whether if it's a pleasant feeling about the voice, but that has to do more with the texture of the

project onto the robot and you want the robot to not disappoint their expectations for how it's going to answer or behave in order for them to have this kind of illusion."}, {"time": 2091, "text":

Interaction that I read the last time we scheduled this."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Oh my God, that was a long time ago."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "What are some good and bad cases of anthropomorphism in your perspective?"}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Like when is the good ones and bad?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Well, I should start by saying that, you know, while design can really enhance the anthropomorphism, it doesn't take a lot to get people to treat a robot like it's alive."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Like people will, over 85% of Roombas have a name, which I'm, I don't know the numbers for your regular type of vacuum cleaner, but they're not that high, right?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So people will feel bad for the Roomba when it gets stuck, they'll send it in for repair and want to get the same one back."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "And that's, that one is not even designed to like make you do that."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "So I think that some of the cases where it's maybe a little bit concerning that anthropomorphism is happening is when you have something that's supposed to function like a tool and people are using it in the wrong way."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "And one of the concerns is military robots where, so gosh, 2000, like early 2000s, which is a long time ago, iRobot, the Roomba company made this robot called the Pacbot that was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan with the bomb disposal units that were there."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "And the soldiers became very emotionally attached to the robots."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "And that's fine until a soldier risks his life to save a robot, which you really don't want."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "But they were treating them like pets."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Like they would name them, they would give them funerals with gun salutes, they would get really upset and traumatized when the robot got broken."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "So in situations where you want a robot to be a tool, in particular, when it's supposed to like do a dangerous job that you don't want a person doing, it can be hard when people get emotionally attached to it."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "That's maybe something that you would want to discourage."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Another case for concern is maybe when companies try to leverage the emotional attachment to exploit people."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So if it's something that's not in the consumer's interest, trying to like sell them products or services or exploit an emotional connection to keep them paying for a cloud service for a social robot or something like that might be, I think that's a little bit concerning as well."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "Yeah, the emotional manipulation, which probably happens behind the scenes now with some like social networks and so on, but making it more explicit."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "What's your favorite robot?"}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Fictional or real?"}, {"time": 2293,

impressed with."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "It was, but, but from an anthropomorphic perspective, I was impressed with how much I bonded with it, how much I like wanted to believe that it had this

touch sensors and an infrared camera."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "So it had all these like cool little technical features, even though it was a toy."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "And the thing that really struck me about it was that it, it could mimic pain and distress really well."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "So if you held it up by the tail, it had a tilt sensor that, you know, told it what direction it was facing and it would start to squirm and cry out."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "If you hit it too hard, it would start to cry."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So it was very impressive in design."},

"text": "But visiting them, I, you know, I'm pretty sure that I was very impressed."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And in terms of the control, I think that was a transformational moment for me when I met Spot Mini in person."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "Because, okay, maybe this is a psychology experiment, but I anthropomorphized the, the crap out of it."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "So I immediately, it was like my best friend, right?"}, {"time": 2430, "text": "I think it's really hard for anyone to watch Spot move and not feel like it has agency."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "This movement, especially the arm on Spot Mini really obviously looks like a head."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "That they say, no, wouldn't mean it that way, but it obviously, it looks exactly like that."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "And so it's almost impossible to not think of it as a, almost like the baby dinosaur, but slightly larger."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "And this movement of the, of course, the intelligence is, their whole idea is that it's not supposed to be intelligent."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "It's a platform on which you build higher intelligence."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's actually really, really dumb."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's just a basic movement platform."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "But even dumb robots can, like, we can immediately respond to them in this visceral way."}, {"time":

between these exponentially improving technologies or let's say changing technologies because some of them are exponentially more dangerous and our intuitions and our human skills and our institutions that just don't change very fast at all."}, {"time": 431, "text": "And that mismatch I think is at the root of a lot of the problems in our society, the growing inequality and other dysfunctions in

think anyone has a really good theory about why we've been so successful in doing that."}, {"time": 681, "text": "It's great that we have been, and I hope it continues for some time, but it's, you

one component of it that's not keeping up, then the economic incentives become really large to improve that one part."}, {"time": 706, "text": "It becomes a bottleneck and anyone who can do

speed."}, {"time": 766, "text": "Other dimensions of Moore's law are in AI and machine learning."}, {"time": 771, "text": "Those tend to be very parallelizable functions, especially deep neural

algorithm."}, {"time": 820, "text": "It's fascinating to think like, can I actually continue?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "I was figuring out more and more tricks on how to train networks faster and faster."}, {"time": 827, "text": "The progress has been staggering."}, {"time": 829, "text": "If you look at image recognition, as you mentioned, I think it's a function of at least three things that are coming together."}, {"time": 834, "text": "One, we just talked about faster chips, not just Moore's law, but GPUs, TPUs and other technologies."}, {"time": 840, "text": "The second is just a lot more data."}, {"time": 842, "text": "I mean, we are awash in digital data today in a way we weren't 20 years ago."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Photography, I'm old enough to remember, it used to be

basically internet data."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And that's one of the, I've seen arguments made and they seem to be pretty convincing that the bottleneck there is going to be how much data there is on the internet, which is a fascinating idea that it literally will just run out of human generated data to train on."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Right, I know we make it to the point where it's consumed basically all of human knowledge or all digitized human knowledge, yeah."}, {"time": 939, "text": "And that will be the bottleneck."}, {"time": 940, "text": "But the interesting thing with bottlenecks is people often use bottlenecks as a way to argue against exponential growth."}, {"time": 949, "text": "They say, well, there's no way you can overcome this bottleneck, but we seem to

some things like driving on a highway, you know, from LA to Phoenix, where it's mostly good weather, straight roads."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "That's close to a solved problem, let's face it."},

levels of self driving, you know, level one, two, three, four, five."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "I think Andrew Ng has convinced me that this idea of really focusing on level four, where you only go in areas that are well mapped rather than just going out in the wild is the way things are gonna evolve."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "But you can just keep expanding those areas where you've mapped things really well, where you really understand them and eventually all become kind of interconnected."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And that could be a kind of another way of progressing to make it more feasible over time."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I mean, that's kind of like the Waymo approach, which is they just now released, I think just like a day or two ago, a public, like anyone from the public in the Phoenix, Arizona to, you know, you can get a ride in a Waymo car with no person, no driver."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Oh, they've taken away the safety driver?"}, {"time": 1217, "text":

the right direction with that."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "No, they've Waymo in particular done a really good job of that."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "They actually have a very interesting

"Yeah, I can see that being really, because I think the thing that's proven harder than maybe some of the early people expected was there's a long tail of weird exceptions."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So you can deal with 90, 99, 99.99% of the cases, but then there's something that just never been seen before in the training data."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And humans more or less can work around that."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Although let me be clear and note, there are about 30,000 human fatalities just in the United States and maybe a million worldwide."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So

machine."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "And so we have to do a lot better at dealing with those edge cases."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And also the tricky thing that if I have a criticism for the Waymo

easy to create a thing that's safe at the extremes, but then nobody wants to get into it."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Yeah, well, back to Elon, I think one of, part of his genius was with the electric cars."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Before he came along, electric cars were all kind of underpowered, really light, and there were sort of wimpy cars that weren't fun."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And the first thing he did was he made a roadster that went zero to 60 faster than just about any other car and went the other end."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I think that was a really wise marketing move

point is that if we spend time thinking about it, we can amplify truth over falsehoods."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And I'm disappointed in the heads of these social networks that they haven't been as

20."}, {"time": 948, "text": "It's not very hard."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And so the way to do that is to let people know that they're infectious."}, {"time": 955, "text": "I mean, we're a perfect

do that."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "It's this faulty thinking in our country, which, you know, frankly is driven by big money, big, you know, the only time when we actually think that we can do

part of your work from before the COVID, it does seem that I saw a statistic currently is that 40% would not be taken, of Americans would not be taking the vaccine, some number like this."}, {"time":

1271, "text": "And then a pandemic comes around and we just assume that the average person is gonna wipe all that away and say, oh no, I'm happy giving out not just my own medical data, but also to tell the authorities, everyone who I've spent my time with, so that they all get a call and are pissed at me for giving up their names."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "You know, so people aren't getting tested and they're definitely not giving up their contacts when it comes to contact tracing."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And so for so many reasons, that approach is failing."}, {"time": 1298, "text":

this."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "I still can't believe this is not more popular."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Okay, but our, one of the FAQs you have is a rapid test too expensive."}, {"time": 1355,

much, but it's kind of the cream of the crop in terms of these rapid tests."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "This is the one that the US government bought and it is doing an amazing job."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "So it's really, it's really good."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And so essentially the way it works is you just, you use a swab, you put the, once you kind of use a swab on yourself, you put the swab into these little holes here."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "You put some buffer on it and you close it and a line will show up

tests as medical devices."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So what happens when you, if I'm a medical company, if I'm a test production company and I wanna make this test and I go through and the FDA at the end of my authorization, the FDA says, okay, you now have a medical device, not a public health tool, but a medical device."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "And that affords you the ability to charge insurance companies for it."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "Why would I ever as a, you know, in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure, why would I ever not sell this for $30 when insurance will pay for it or $100?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "You know, it might only cost me 50 cents to make, but by pushing all of these tests through a medical pathway at the FDA, what extrudes out the other side is an expensive medical device that's erroneously expensive."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "It doesn't need to be inflated in cost, but the companies say, well, I'd rather make fewer of them and just sell them all for $30 a piece than make tens of millions of them, which I could do, and sell them at a dollar marginal profit."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "And so it's a problem with our whole medical industry that we see tests only as medical devices and what I would like to see is for the government in the same way that they bought 150 million of these from Abbott, they should be buying,

lateral flow tests."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And you take a swab, you swab the front of your nose, you dunk that swab into some buffer, and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer onto the

up into individual ones."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "And if there's any virus on that buffer, as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus, and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in

simple."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "It is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "It's the technology, this particular one from Abbott, this has been used for other

this Abbott one here is, there's the, in this case, instead of being put in a plastic sheath, it's just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "I mean, it looks like nothing, you know, it's just, it looks like a, like, I mean, it's just the simplest thing you could imagine."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "The exterior packaging looks very Apple like, it's nice."},

be careful with humidity so they all have a little, one of those humidity removing things and oxygen removing things."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So that's, this is one class, these antigen tests."},

just three major classes of tests."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "We'll start with the first two."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "The first two tests are just looking for the virus or looking for antibodies against the virus."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "So we've heard about serology tests, or maybe some people have heard about it."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "Those are a different kind of test."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "They're looking to see has somebody in the past, does somebody have an immune response against the virus, which would indicate that they were infected or exposed to it."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "So we're not talking about the antibody tests."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "I'll just leave it at that."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "Those, they actually can look very similar to this, or they can be done in a laboratory."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Those are usually done from blood and they're looking for an immune response to the virus."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "Everything I'm talking about here is looking for the virus itself, not the immune response to the virus."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And so there's two ways to look for the virus."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "You can either look for the genetic code of the virus, like the RNA, just like the DNA of somebody's human cells, or you can look for the proteins themselves, the antigens of the virus."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So I like to differentiate them."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "If you were a PCR test that looks for RNA in, let's say if we made it against humans, it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "That would be actually looking for our genetic code."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "The equivalent to an antigen test is sort of a test that like actually is looking for our eyes or our nose or physical features of our body that would delineate, okay, this is Michael, for example."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "And so you're either looking for a sequence or you're looking for a structure."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now and they're done in labs usually are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA."}, {"time":

other things."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "So this Detect device, that's the name of the company, this is actually a rapid RNA detection device."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "So it's almost, it's like a PCR like test and we could even do it here."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "It's really, it's a beautiful test in my opinion, works exceedingly well."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "It's gonna be a little bit more expensive."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "So I think it could confirm, could be used as a confirmatory test for these."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "Is there a greater accuracy to it?"}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Yes, I would say that there is a greater accuracy."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "There's also a downfall though of PCR and tests that look for RNA."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "They can sometimes detect somebody who is no longer infectious."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "So you have the RNA test and then you have these antigen tests."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "The antigen tests look for structures, but they're generally only going to turn positive if people have actively replicating virus in them."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And so what happens after an infection dissipates, you've just gone from having sort of a spike."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "So if you get infected, maybe three days later, the virus gets into exponential growth and it can replicate to trillions of viruses inside the body."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "Your immune system then kind of tackles it and beats it down to nothing."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "But what ends up in the wake of that, you just had a battle."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "You had this massive battle that just took place inside your upper respiratory tract."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "And because of that, you've had trillions and trillions of viruses go to zero, essentially."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "But the RNA is still there."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "It's just these remnants."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "In the same way that if you go to a crime scene and blood was sort of spread all over the crime scene, you're going to find a lot of DNA."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "There's tons of DNA."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "There's no people anymore, but there's a lot of DNA there."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "Same thing happens here."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "And so what's happening with PCR testing is when people go and use these exceedingly high sensitivity PCR tests, people will stay positive for weeks or months after their infection has subsided, which has caused a lot of problems, in my opinion."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "It's problems that the CDC and the FDA and doctors don't want to deal with."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "But I've tried to publish on it."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "I've tried to suggest that this is an issue, both to New York Times and others."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "And now it's unfortunately kind of taken on a life of its own of conspiracy theorists thinking that they call it a case demic."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "They say, oh, you know, PCR is detecting people who are no longer, who are false positive."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "They're not false positives."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "They're late positives, no longer transmissible."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "I think the way you, like what I saw in rapidtest.org, I really liked the distinction between diagnostic sensitivity and contagiousness sensitivity."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "That's, it's so, that website is so obvious that it's painful because it's like, yeah, that's what we should be talking about is how accurately is a test able to detect your contagiousness?"}, {"time": 2326, "text": "And you have different plots that show that actually there's, you know, that antigen tests, the tests we're looking at today, like rapid tests, are actually really good at detecting contagiousness."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "It all mixes back with this whole idea that, of the medical industrial complex."},

a regulatory landscape for it."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "And so the only window we have to look at a test today is as a medical diagnostic test."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And that becomes very problematic when we're trying to tackle a public health threat and a public health emergency."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "By definition, this is a public health emergency that we're in."}, {"time":

physician hat for a moment."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And if I have a patient who comes to me and wants to know if their symptoms are a result of them having COVID, then I want every shred of evidence that I can get to see, does this person currently or did they recently have this infection inside of them?"}, {"time": 2417, "text": "And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "It's really sensitive."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "It will find the RNA if it's there at all so that I could say, you know, yeah, you have a low amount of RNA left."},

it."}, {"time": 2438, "text": "But that's a medical diagnosis."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "It's kind of like a detective recreating a crime scene."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "They wanna go back there and recreate the pieces so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "But that's not public health."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "In public health, we need to only look forward."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "We don't wanna go back and say, well, was this person, are there symptoms because they had an infection two weeks ago?"}, {"time": 2461, "text": "In public health, we just wanna stop the virus from spreading to the next person."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "And so that's where we don't care if somebody was infected two weeks ago."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "We only care about finding the people who are infectious today."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And unfortunately, our regulatory landscape fails to apply that knowledge to evaluate these tests as public health tools."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "They're only evaluating the tests as medical tools."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And therefore, we get all kinds of complaints that say this test, which detects 99 plus, 99.8% of current infectious people, by the FDA's rubric, they'll say, no, no, it's only 50% sensitive."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "And that's because when you go out into the world and you just compare this against PCR positivity, most people who are PCR positive in the world right now at any given time are post infectious."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "They're no longer infectious because you might only be infectious for five days, but then you'll remain PCR positive for three or four or five weeks."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And so when you go and just evaluate these tests and you say, okay, this person's PCR positive, does the rapid antigen test detect that?"}, {"time": 2537, "text": "More often than not, it's no."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "But that's because those people don't need isolation."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "They're post infectious."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And it's become much more of a problem than I think even the FDA themself is recognizing because

concern I have is that a bigger pandemic comes along."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "What are the lessons we draw from this and how we move forward?"}, {"time": 2568, "text": "Let's talk about that in a bit."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "But sort of, can we discuss further the lay of the land here of the different tests before us?"}, {"time": 2577, "text": "So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in the lab or they're done essentially with a rapid test like this, the detect, and we can even try this in a moment."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "It goes into a little heater."}, {"time": 2589, "text":

2646, "text": "Yeah, why don't we start with this one?"}, {"time": 2648, "text": "Because this is Abbott's Buy Next Now test and it's really, it's pretty simple."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "This is the swab from the Abbott test."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "That's the swab from the Abbott test."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "So what I'm gonna do to start is I'm going to take this buffer here, which is,

just take six drops of this buffer and put it right onto this test here."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "Two, three, four, five, six."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "And now you're gonna take that swab, open it up."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "Yep, and now just wipe it around inside the, into the front of your nose."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "Do a few circles on each nostril."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "That

things that my plan calls for is because sometimes these tests can get false positive results, it's rare."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "Maybe 1% or in the case of this Binex now, this Abbott test 0.1%."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "So one in a thousand, one in 500, something like that can be falsely positive."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "What I recommend is that when somebody is positive on one of these, you turn around and you immediately test on a different test."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "You could either do it on the same, but for good measure, you want to use a separate test that is somewhat orthogonal, meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive for the same reason."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "This particular test here, this detect test because it is looking for the RNA and not the antigen, this is an amazingly accurate test and it's sort of a perfect gold standard or confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "So one of the recommendations that I've had, especially if people start using antigen tests before you get onto a plane or as what I call entrance screening, if somebody is positive, you don't immediately tell them, you're positive, go isolate for 10 days."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "You tell them, let's confirm on one of these, on a detect test."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "That is because it's completely orthogonal, it's looking for the RNA instead of the antigen."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "There's no reason, no biological reason that both of these should be falsely positive."}, {"time": 2927, "text":

negative, then the antigen test would be considered falsely positive."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "It does look like there's only a single line, so this is very exciting news."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "That's right, yep."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines, but in general, if somebody's really gonna be positive, that line starts showing up within a minute or two."},

digging the sexy packaging."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "I'm a sucker for good packaging, okay."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "So then there's this test here, which is, this is another, it's funny."},

the exact same way as this, essentially, but what you can see is it's got lights in it and a power button and stuff."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "This is called an allume test, which is fine, and it's a really nice test, to be honest, but it has to pair with an iPhone."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "And so it's good as a, I think that this is gonna become, there's a lot of use for this from a medical perspective, where you want good reporting."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "This can, because it pairs with an iPhone, it can immediately send the report to a department of health, whereas these paper strip tests, they're just paper."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "They don't report anything unless you wanna report it."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Okay, so I'm gonna just pick it apart."}, {"time": 3028,

was using a slightly different one, one of these, but that requires an instrument called the BD Veritor."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "And he got a false positive, or no, I shouldn't say, he didn't necessarily get a false positive."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "He got discrepant results."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "He did this test four times."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "He got two positives, two negatives, but then he got a PCR test and it was a very low positive result."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "So I think what happened is he just tested himself at the tail end of an, this was actually right before he was about to send those."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "It was the day of essentially that he was sending the astronauts up to the space station the other day."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So he was using these rapid tests cause he wanted to make sure that he was good to go in and he got discrepant results."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "Ultimately they were correct, but two were negative, two were positive."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "But what really happened once he shared his PCR results and they were very low positive."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "So really what was happening is, my guess is he found himself right at the edge of his positivity, of his infectiousness."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And so the test worked how it was supposed to work."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "It probably had he used it two days earlier, it would have been screaming positive."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "He wouldn't have gotten discrepant results, but he found himself right at the edge by the time he used the test."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So the PCR would always pick it up cause it's still, cause that will still stay positive then for weeks potentially."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter, not in a bad way, but just he probably was really no longer particularly infectious."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "And so it was kind of when it gets to be a very low viral load, it becomes stochastic."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "It's fascinating this duality."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "So one you can think from an individual perspective, it's unclear when you take four and half are positive, half are negative, like what are you supposed to do?"}, {"time": 3265, "text": "But from a societal perspective, it seems like if just one of them is positive, just stay home for a couple of days, for a while."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So when you're a CEO of a company, you're launching astronauts to space, you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test as a thing by which you steer your decisions of like 10,000 plus people companies."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "But us individuals just living in the world, if you can, if it comes up positive, then you make decisions based on that."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "And then that scales really nicely to an entire society of hundreds of millions of people."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And that's how you get that virus to stop spreading."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "You don't have to catch every single one."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "And the nice thing is that these will, these will catch the people who are most infectious."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "So with Elon Musk, it generally that test, we don't have the counterfactual."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "We don't have his results from three days earlier when he was probably most infectious."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "But my guess is the fact that it was catching two out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value of really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test suggests that it was doing its job."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And you just wanna, and the nice thing is because these can be produced at such scale, getting one positive doesn't immediately have to mean 10 days of isolation."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "That's the CDC is more conservative stance to say, if you're positive on any tests, stay home for 10 days and isolate."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "But here, people would just have more tests."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "So the recommendation should be test daily."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "If you turn positive, test daily until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours and then go back to work."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "And the nice thing there is right now, people just aren't testing because they don't wanna take 10 days off."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "They're not getting paid for it."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "So they can't take 10 days off."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea of rapid testing for everybody?"}, {"time": 3383, "text": "So I understood I need to look at that whole Twitter thread."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So I understand his perhaps criticism of, he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it of like, what's going on here with these tests?"}, {"time": 3397, "text": "But what does he actually think about this very practical to me engineering solution of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?"}, {"time": 3405, "text": "It seems like that's a way to open up the economy in April."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Well, to be honest, I've been trying to get in touch with him again."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "I think, take somebody like Elon Musk with the engineering prowess within his ranks, to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "He could build the machines from scratch."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "A lot of the companies, they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "We don't have to, we can build these machines."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "They're simple to build."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "Put somebody like Elon Musk on it, take some of his best engineers and say, look, the US needs a solution in two weeks."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "Build these machines, figure it out."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "He'll do it, he could do it."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "This is a guy who is literally, he has started multiple entirely new industries."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "He has the capital to do it without the US government if he wanted to."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And you know what, it would, the return on investment for him would be huge."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "But frankly, the return on investment in the country would be hundreds of billions of dollars, because it means we could get society open."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "So I know that his first experience with these rapid tests was confusing, which is how I ended up having this Twitter kind of conversation with him very briefly."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "But I think that if he understood sort of a little bit more, and I think he does, I really love to talk to him about it, because I think he could totally change the course of this pandemic in the United States, single handedly."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "He loves grand things."},

the engineering solution."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "So this is something I've been really trying to, I'm an engineer, my previous history was all engineering, and that's really how I think."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "I then went into medicine and PhD world, but I think that the world, like one of the major catastrophes, or one of the major problems, is that we have physicians making the decisions about public health and a pandemic, when really we need engineers."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "This is an engineering problem."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "And so what I've been trying to do, I actually really want to start a whole new field called public health engineering."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "And so I've been, eventually I want to try to bring it to MIT and get MIT to want to start a new department or something."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "That's a doubly awesome idea."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "That, this is really, okay."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "I love this, I love every aspect."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "I love everything you're talking about."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "A lot of people believe, because vaccines started being deployed currently, that we are no longer in need of a solution."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "We're no longer in need of slowing the spread of the virus."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "To me, as I understand, it seems like this is the most important time to have something like a rapid testing solution."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Can you kind of break that apart?"}, {"time": 3594, "text": "What's the role of rapid testing currently in

Downer here, but there's a lot of unknowns with this vaccine."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "You've already mentioned one, which is there's a lot of people who just don't want to get the vaccine."},

don't know how effective the vaccine is gonna be after two or three months."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "We've only measured it in the first two or three months, which is a massive problem, which we can go into biologically, because there's very good reasons to believe that the efficacy could fall way down after two or three months."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "We don't know if it's gonna stop transmission."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And if it doesn't stop transmission, then there's, you know, herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get because that's all based on transmission blockade."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "And frankly, we don't know how easily we're going to be able to roll it out."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains, have very short half lives outside of that cold chain."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "We need to organize massive numbers of people to be able to distribute these."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Most hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped to hire the right people to be even administering enough of these vaccines."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And then a lot of the hospitals are frustrated because they're getting much lower, smaller allocations than they were expecting."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "So I think right now, like you say, right now is the best time, you know, besides three or four or five or six months ago, right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "And we need to, I mean, the country has the capacity to build them."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "We have, we're shipping them overseas right now."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "We just need to flip a switch, get the FDA to recognize that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine, which is the effectiveness of the public health program when we're dealing with a pandemic."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "They need to authorize these as public health tools, or, you know, frankly, the president could, you know, there's a lot of other ways to get these tests to not have to go through the normal FDA authorization program, but maybe have the NIH and the CDC give a stamp of approval."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "And that's where that article came from, you know, how we can stop the spread of this virus by Christmas, we could, you know, now it's getting late."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And so we have to keep updating that timeframe, maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn't, I should have said how we can stop the spread of this virus in a month."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "It would be a little bit more timeless, but we could do it, you know, we really could do it."},

that policy wise?"}, {"time": 3780, "text": "So this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to, which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach to public health."}, {"time": 3791, "text":

the ideas here?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "I think it's a little of both."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "I think it's political on the one hand, and I've certainly been talking to Congress a lot, talking to senators."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "Are they receptive?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "I mean, that's the crazy thing."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "Everyone but the FDA is receptive."}, {"time": 3827,

everyone recognizes that."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "So why do you think, like the mayor of LA, why do you think politicians are going for these, from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns,

speaking, but it just doesn't, at least in this country, we don't, I think it's just impossible to have complete lockdown."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And still politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns that everybody hates, that's really hurting small businesses."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "Like why are they going for that?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "And big businesses, and yeah, all businesses, but like basically not just hurting, they're destroying small businesses, right?"}, {"time": 3998, "text": "Which is going to have potentially, I mean, yeah, I've been reading as I don't

everyone is deferential, including the heads of all the other government agencies because that is their role."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "But what everyone is failing to see is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit to evaluate these tests as public health tools."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So they're just falling in this weird gray zone where the FDA is saying, look, we evaluate medical products."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "That's the only thing that I meant, like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA, he's doing what his job is, which is to evaluate medical tools."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC has really blundered."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "They haven't made the right distinction to say, look, okay, the FDA is evaluating these for doctors to use and all that, but we're the CDC and we're the public health agency of this country and we recognize that these tools require a different authorization pathway and a different use, not prescription."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "There's a difference between medical devices and public health."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "And I guess FDA is not designed for this public

it."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "And so I say, okay, great, we'll go and use it."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "And then the comment is, but does it give a result back to somebody?"}, {"time": 4208, "text":

Services, as a medical device requiring medical authorization."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "But then you go and ask, it gets crazier, because then you go and ask Seema Verma, the head of CMS, you know,

public health tool."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "And Seema Verma says, oh, we don't have any jurisdiction over point of care and sort of rapid devices like this."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "We only have

prescription."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now, because there is this sense that tests are public health tools, even if they're not being defined as such, the FDA now is pretty much, not only are they not authorizing these as public health tools, what they're doing by authorizing what are effectively public health tools as medical devices, they're just diluting down the practice of medicine."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately is, well, I don't know why you want these to be sort of available to everyone without a prescription."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "We've already said that a doctor can write a whole prescription for a whole college campus."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "It's like, well, if you're going in that

medicine and eroding all of the legal rules and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So it's just everything about it is just destructive instead of just making a simple solution, which is these are okay as public health tools as long as they meet X and Y metrics, go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "What do you think, sorry if I'm stuck on this, your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?"}, {"time": 4367, "text": "I mean, it has a sense of, I talked to computational biology folks."},

from a bioengineering perspective."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools to A, interpret that."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "But what I really wanna do, for example, to kind of kick off this new field of what I consider public health engineering is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious, but create a weather system for viruses."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "I want us to be able to open up our iPhones, plug in our zip code and get a better sense, get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "Is it COVID?"}, {"time": 4453,

in the 21st century."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "We have the tools at our disposal now to not have that attitude."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "This isn't like 1920s."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "You know,

incredible."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "And it seems like it should be within our reach, the, just these like weather maps of viruses floating about the Earth, and it seems obvious."}, {"time": 4586,

there's this weird place where it's like obvious that if we do, if we collect a lot of data about human beings and maintain privacy and maintain all like basic respect for that data, just like

people or to do this well, do you have ideas here?"}, {"time": 4676, "text": "How big is this problem?"}, {"time": 4678, "text": "I think it's a central problem."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "There's a couple central problems that need to be solved."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "One, how do you get all the samples?"}, {"time": 4685, "text": "That's not actually too difficult."}, {"time": 4687, "text":

"text": "So what we're doing, for example, there's a lot of people who go to the hospital every day, a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "So one of the projects that I have, I'll get to the privacy question in a moment, but this, so what I wanna do is the name that I've given this as a global immunological observatory."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "There's no reason not to have that."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "I've said, instead of saying, well, how do we possibly get enough people on board to send in samples all the time?"}, {"time": 4736, "text": "Well, just go to the source."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "So there's a company in Massachusetts that makes 80% of all the instruments that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said, is there a way you have 80% of the global market on plasma donations?"}, {"time": 4758, "text": "Can we start getting plasma samples from healthy people that use your machines?"}, {"time": 4764, "text": "So that hooked me up with this company called Octopharma."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And Octopharma has a huge reach and offices all over the country where they're just collecting people's plasma."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "They actually pay people for their plasma and then that gets distributed to hospitals and all this stuff is anonymous plasma."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "So I've just been collecting anonymous samples."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "And we're processing them, in this case, for COVID antibodies to watch from January up through December, we're able to watch how the virus entered into the United States and how it's transmitting every day across the US."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "So we're getting those results organized now and we're gonna start putting them publicly online soon to start making at least a very rough map of COVID."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "But that's the type of thinking that I have in terms of like, how do you actually capture huge numbers of specimens?"}, {"time": 4817, "text": "You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a, I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools and you can offer individuals something in return like 23andMe does."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "That's a great way to get people to give specimens and they get results back."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "So with these technologies that I've been building along with some collaborators at Harvard, we can come up with tools that people might actually want."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "So I can offer you your immunological history."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper, mail it in and I will be able to tell you every infectious disease you've ever encountered and maybe even when you encountered it roughly."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now?"}, {"time": 4858,

anything."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "If your immune system makes a response to it, we can detect that response."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So all of a sudden we have this very valuable technology that on the one hand gives people maybe information they might want to know about themselves, but on the other hand becomes this amazingly rich source of big data to enter into this global immunological observatory sort of mathematical framework to start building these maps, these epidemiological tools."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "But you asked about privacy and absolutely that's essential to keep in mind first and foremost."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "So privacy can be, you can keep these samples 100% anonymous."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "They're literally just tubes."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "I know a date that they were collected and a zip code that they're collected from or even just sort of a county level ID."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So with an IRB and with ethical approval and with the people's consent, we can maybe collect more data, but that would require consent."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "But then there's this other approach which I'm really excited about, which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny I think, but we'll have to figure out where it comes into play."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "But I've been recognizing that we can take somebody's immunological profile and we can make a biological fingerprint out of it."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "And it's actually stable enough so that I could take your blood."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "Let's say I don't know who you are, but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago and then you sent me a drop of blood today."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "I don't know that those two blood spots are coming from the same person."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "They're just showing up in my lab."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "But I can run our technology over and it just gives me your immunological history."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "But your immunological history is so unique to you and the way that your body responds to these pathogens is so unique to you that I can use that to tether your two samples."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "I don't know who you are, I know nothing about you."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "I only know when those samples came out of a person."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "But I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart actually belong to the same person."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "Yeah, so there's sufficient information in that immunological history to match the samples."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Does that generally hold for humans?"}, {"time": 5000, "text": "So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match?"}, {"time": 5003, "text": "Yeah, because it's very stochastic, even twins."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So this, I believe, we haven't published this yet."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "We will soon."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "You have a twin too, right?"}, {"time": 5010, "text": "I do have a twin, I have an identical twin brother, which makes me interested in this."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "He looks very much like me."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Oh, is that how that works?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "And DNA can't really tell us apart."}, {"time": 5022, "text": "But this tool is one of the only tools in the world that could tell twins apart from each other."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "Could still be accurate enough to say this blood, it's like 99.999% accurate to say that these two blood samples came from the same individual."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "And it's because it's a combination, both of your immunological history, but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen, which is random."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "The way that we make antibodies is, by and large, it's got an element of randomness to it."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "How the cells, when they make an antibody, they chop up the genetic code to say, okay, this is the antibody that I'm gonna form for this pathogen."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example, you might form hundreds of different antibodies, not just one antibody against the spike protein, but hundreds of different antibodies against all different parts of the virus."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "So that gives this really rich resolution of information that when I then do the same thing across hundreds of different pathogens, some of which you've seen, some of which you haven't, it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint that is sufficiently stable over years and years and years to essentially give you a barcode."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "And I don't have to know who you are, but I can know that these two specimens came from the same person somewhere out in the world."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "So fascinating that there's this trace, your life story in the space of viruses, in the space of pathogen, like these, you know, because there's this entire universe of these organisms that are trying to destroy each other."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And then your little trajectory through that space leaves a trace, and then you can look at that trace."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "And that, I mean, there's, okay, that data period is just fascinating."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "And the vision of making that data universally connected to where you can make, like infer things, and just like with the weather, is really fascinating."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "And there's probably artificial intelligence applications there, start making predictions, start finding patterns."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "Exactly, we're doing a lot of that already."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "And that's how, how do we have this going?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "You know, I've been trying to get this funded for years now."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "And I've spoken to governments, you know, everyone says, cool idea, not gonna do it."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "You know, why do we need it?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "The why do you need it?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "Yeah, the why do you need it."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "And of course now, you know, I mean, I wrote in 2015 about this, why we would, why this would be useful."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And of course, now we're seeing why it would be useful."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "Had we had this up and running in 2019, had we had it going, we were drawing blood from, you know, we're getting blood samples from hospitals and clinics and blood donors from New York City, let's just say, you know, that could have, we didn't run the first PCR test for coronavirus until probably a month and a half or two months after the virus started transmitting in New York City."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So it's like with the rain, we didn't start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Exactly, for two months, but different than the rain, we couldn't actually see that it was spreading right now."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice but to leave the city open."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "You know, there were hints that maybe the virus was spreading in New York City, but you know, he didn't have any data to back it up."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "No data."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And so it was just week on week and week."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "And he didn't have any information to really go by to allow him to have the firepower to say we're closing down the city."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "This is an emergency."}, {"time": 5241, "text": "We have to stop spread before it starts."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "And so they waited until the first PCR tests were coming about."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "And then the moment they started running PCR tests, they find out it's everywhere."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "You know, and so that was a disaster because of course New York City, you know, was just hit so bad because nobody was, you know, we were blind to it."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "We didn't have to be blind to it."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And the nice thing about this technology is we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology we had in 2017, we could have detected this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Not because we changed, not because we are actually actively looking for this novel coronavirus, but because we would see, we would have seen patterns in people's immune responses using AI, or just frankly using our, just the raw data itself."}, {"time": 5290, "text": "We could have said, hey, it looks like there's something that looks like known coronavirus is spreading in New York, but there's gaps."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "You know, there's, for some reason, people aren't developing an immune response to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading to these normal things that, you know, and it just looks, the profile looks different."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "And we could have seen that and immediately, especially since we had an idea that there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world, we could have very quickly and easily seen, hey, clearly we're seeing a spike of something that looks like a known coronavirus, but people are responding weirdly to it."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "Our AI algorithms would have picked it up, and just our basic, heck, you could have put it in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "Some basic visualization would have shown it."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Exactly, we would have seen spikes, and they would have been kind of like off, you know, immune responses that the shape of them just looked a little bit different, but they would have been growing, and we would have seen it, and it could have saved tens of thousands of lives in New York City."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "So to me, the fascinating question, everything we've talked about, so both the huge collection of data at scale, just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious at scale solution to the current virus and future ones is the rapid testing."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "Can we talk about the future of viruses that might be threatening our very existence?"}, {"time": 5379, "text": "So do you think like a future natural virus can have an order of magnitude greater effect on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?"}, {"time": 5392, "text": "So something that either kills all humans, or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "So something like something we can't even imagine."}, {"time": 5409, "text": "Because it seems to not have happened yet."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution from the Big Bang seems to not want to destroy us humans."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "Or maybe that's the natural side effect of the evolutionary process that humans are useful."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "But do you think it's possible that the evolutionary process will produce a virus that will kill all humans?"}, {"time": 5435, "text": "I think it could."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "I don't think it's likely."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "And the reason I don't think it's likely is on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet, in part because mobility is a recent phenomena."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "People weren't particularly mobile until fairly recently."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "Now, of course, now that we have people flying back and forth across the globe all the time, the chances of global pandemics has escalated exponentially, of course."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "And so on the one hand, that's part of why it hasn't happened yet."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "We can look at things like Ebola."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "Now, Ebola, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics in the past, not because Ebola wasn't transmitting and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting and infecting humans in disconnected communities."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "So you see out in rural parts of Africa, for example, in Western Africa, you might end up having isolated Ebola outbreaks, but there weren't connections that were fast enough that would allow people to then spread it into the cities."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Of course, we

to learn it and you start to say, hey, I'm picking up this glass is actually 18 little movements."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "Then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting and exhilarating to just breathe."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "Breathing alone and the rise and fall of your abdomen or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose becomes almost interesting."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "And

a dozen people, uh, who came together, uh, to, to work on this project at Google."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "At that time we saw an incredible early result in the DARPA urban challenge."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "I think we're all incredibly excited, uh, about where we got to and we believed in the future of the technology, but we still had a very, you know, very, you know, rudimentary

{"time": 1524, "text": "So you would get to the beginning of the course, uh, you would press the button that would engage in autonomy and you had to go for a hundred miles, you know, beginning to end, uh, with no interventions."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "Um, and it sampled again, the full complexity of driving conditions."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Some, uh, were on freeways."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "We had one route that went all through all the freeways and all the bridges in the Bay area."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "You know, we had, uh, some that went around Lake Tahoe and kind of mountains, uh, roads."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "We had some that drove through dense urban, um, environments like in downtown Palo Alto and through San Francisco."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "So it was incredibly, uh, interesting, uh, to work on."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And it, uh, it took us just under two years, uh, about a year and a half, a little bit more to finish both of these milestones."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And in that process, uh, you know, it was an incredible amount of fun, probably the most fun I had in my professional career."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And you're just learning so much."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "You are, you know, the goal here is to learn and prototype."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "You're not yet starting to build a production system, right?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So you just, you were, you know, this is when you're kind of working 24 seven and you're hacking things together."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "And you also don't know how hard this is."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "I mean, that's the point."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Like, so, I mean, that's an ambitious, if I put myself in that mindset, even still, that's a really ambitious set of goals."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Like just those two picking, picking 10 different, difficult, spicy challenges."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And then having zero interventions."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "So like not saying gradually we're going to like, you know, over a period of 10 years, we're going to have a bunch of routes and gradually reduce the number of interventions, you know, that literally says like, by as soon as possible, we want to have zero and on hard roads."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So like, to me, if I was facing that, it's unclear that whether that takes two years or whether that takes 20 years."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "I mean, it took us under two."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "I guess that that speaks to a really big difference between doing something once and having a prototype where you are going after, you know, learning about the problem versus how you go about engineering a product that, you know, where you look at, you know, you do properly do evaluation, you look at metrics, you drive down and you're confident that you can do that."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "That's another really important moment."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Is there some memories of technical lessons or just one, like, what did you learn about the problem of driving from that experience?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "Like what the hell is driving as an autonomous, or maybe I'm again romanticizing it, but is it, is there, is there some valuable lessons you picked up over there at those two years?"}, {"time": 1758, "text": "A ton."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "But we've tried, we've sampled enough of the problem space and we've made enough rapid success, even, you know, with technology of 2009, 2010, that it gave us confidence to then, you know,

creation of Waymo and beyond?"}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Yeah, we had a, it was a really interesting journey and, you know, Waymo came a little bit later, then, you know, we completed those milestones in 2010."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "That was the pivot when we decided to focus on actually building a product using this technology."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "The initial couple of years after that, we were focused on a freeway, you know, what you would call a driver assist, maybe, you know, an L3 driver assist program."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Then around 2013, we've learned enough about the space and thought more deeply about, you know, the product that we wanted to build, that we pivoted, we pivoted towards this vision of building a driver and deploying it fully driverless vehicles without a person."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "And that that's the path that we've been on since then."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And very, it was exactly the right decision for us."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So there was a moment where you're also considered like, what is the right trajectory here?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "What is the right role of automation in the, in the task of driving?"}, {"time": 1878, "text": "There's still, it wasn't from the early days, obviously you want to go fully autonomous."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "From the early days, it was not."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "I think it was in 20, around 2013, maybe that we've, that became very clear and we made that pivot and also became very clear and that it's either the way you go building a driver assist system is, you know, fundamentally different from how you go building a fully driverless vehicle."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So, you know, we've pivoted towards the ladder and that's what we've been working on ever since."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And so that was around 2013, then there's sequence of really meaningful for us really important defining milestones since then."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "And in 2015, we had our first, actually the world's first fully driverless trade on public roads."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "It was in a custom built vehicle that we had."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "I must've seen those."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "We called them the Firefly, that, you know, funny looking marshmallow looking thing."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And we put a passenger, his name was Steve Mann,

kind of a controlled environment, but it was a fixed route."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And we only did a few times."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "Then in 2016, end of 2016, beginning of 2017 is when we founded Waymo, the company."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "That's when we kind of, that was the next phase of the project where I wanted, we believed in kind of the commercial vision of this technology."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "And it made sense to create an independent entity, you know, within that alphabet umbrella to pursue this product at scale."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "Beyond that in 2017, later in 2017 was another really huge step for us."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "Really big milestone where we started, I think it was October of 2017 where when we started regular driverless operations on public roads, that first day of operations, we drove in one day."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And that first day, a hundred miles and driverless fashion."}, {"time": 2045,

operations."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "And when you say driverless, it means no driver."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "So on that first day, we actually hit a mix and in some, we didn't want to like, you know, be on YouTube and Twitter that same day."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "So in, in many of the rides we had somebody in the driver's seat, but they could not disengage like the car, not disengage,

driver."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "So that's another, the interesting case of where the driver's not supposed to disengage, that's like a nice middle ground, they're still there, but they're not supposed to disengage, but really there's the case when there's no, okay, there's something magical about there being nobody in the driver's seat."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "There's something about like the steering wheel, cause we perhaps romanticize the notion of the steering wheel, it's so essential to our conception, our 20th century conception of a car and it turning the steering wheel with nobody in driver's seat, that to me, I think maybe to others, it's really powerful."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "Like this thing is in control and then there's this leap of trust that you give."},

technology."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "But, you know, coming back to our journey, you know, that was 2017 when we started, you know, truly driverless operations."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "Then in

about the maturing and the growth of Waymo as a company."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "We raised our first round of external financing this year, you know, we were part of Alphabet."}, {"time": 2317,

know, the actual car that we are driving from the self driving hardware we put on it."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "Right now we have, so this is, as I mentioned, the fifth generation, you know, we've gone through, we started, you know, building our own hardware, you know, many, many years ago."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "And that, you know, Firefly vehicle also had the hardware suite that was

the channels that you use to measure?"}, {"time": 3499, "text": "Because, like, you're no longer, that's one of the magical things about autonomous vehicles is it's not like it's frictionless

to improve?"}, {"time": 3520, "text": "Yeah, great question, various mechanisms."}, {"time": 3520, "text": "So as part of the normal flow, we ask people for feedback, they as the car is driving around, we have on the phone and in the car, and we have a touchscreen in the car, you can actually click some buttons and provide real time feedback on how the car is doing, and how the car is handling a particular situation, you know, both positive and negative."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "So that's one channel, we have, as we discussed, customer support or life help, where, you know, if a customer wants to, has a question, or he has some sort of concern, they can talk to a person in real time."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "So that that is another mechanism that gives us feedback."},

you know, ask them to explain what you know, one, well, and you know, what could be improved."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "And we have our writers providing very rich feedback, they're a lot, a large fraction is very passionate, very excited about this technology."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So we get really good feedback."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "We also run UXR studies, right, you know,

grocery shopping, and they like want to load, you know, 20 bags of groceries in our cars and like that, that's one workflow that you maybe don't think about, you know, getting just right when you're building the driverless product."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "I have people like, you know, who bike as part of their trip."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "So they, you know, bike somewhere, then they get on our cars, they take apart their bike, they load into our vehicle, then go and that's, you know, how they, you know, where we want to pull over and how that, you know, get in and get out process works, provides very useful feedback in terms of what makes a good pickup and drop off location, we get really valuable feedback."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "And in fact, we had to do some really interesting work with high definition maps, and thinking about walking directions."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "And if you imagine you're in a store, right in some giant space, and then you know, you want to be picked up somewhere, like if you just drop a pin at a current location, which is maybe in the middle of a shopping mall, like what's the best location for the car to come pick you up?"}, {"time":

like that's like requires AGI to solve the problem of like, when you're, which is a very common case, when you're in a big space of some kind, like apartment building, it doesn't matter, it's some large space."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "And then you call the, like a Waymo from there, right?"}, {"time": 3749, "text": "Like, whatever, it doesn't matter, ride share vehicle."}, {"time": 3752,

solve."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "Okay, the alternative, which I think the Google search engine is taught is like, there's something really valuable about the perhaps slightly dumb answer, but a

of Google search, when you have like billions of searches, you could, you could see which, like when they recommend what you might possibly mean, they suggest based on not some machine learning thing,

the pretty fundamental property is that the car actually arrives where you told it to, right?"}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Like, you can always, you know, change it, see it on the map, and you can move it around if you don't like it."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "And but like, that property that the car actually shows up reliably is critical, which, you know, where compared to some of the human driven

that as simple as possible."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And then, you know, beyond that, just transportation, making things and goods get to their destination as seamlessly as possible."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "I talked about a drag and drop experience where I kind of express your intent and then it just magically happens."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "And for our writers, that's what we're

a safe and high quality experience."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "And then it gets you in a very reliable, very convenient, frictionless way to where you want to be."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "And along the journey, I think we also want to do little things to delight our users."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "Like the ride sharing companies, because they don't control the experience, I think they can't make people fall in love necessarily with the experience."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "Or maybe they, they haven't put in the effort, but I think if I were to speak to the ride sharing experience I currently have, it's just very, it's just very convenient, but there's a lot of room for like falling in love with it."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "Like we can speak to sort of car companies, car companies do this."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "Well, you can fall in love with a car, right?"}, {"time": 4162, "text": "And be like a loyal car person, like whatever."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Like I like badass hot rods, I guess, 69 Corvette."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And at this point, you know, you can't really, cars are so, owning a car is so 20th century, man."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "But is there something about the Waymo experience where you hope that people will fall in love with it?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "Is that part of it?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "Or is it part of, is it just about making a convenient ride, not ride sharing, I don't know what the right term is, but just a convenient A to B autonomous transport or like, do you want them to fall in love with Waymo?"}, {"time": 4202, "text": "To maybe elaborate a little bit."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "I mean, almost like from a business perspective, I'm curious, like how, do you want to be in the background invisible or do you want to be like a source of joy that's in very much in the foreground?"}, {"time": 4215, "text": "I want to provide the best, most enjoyable transportation solution."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "And that means building it, building our product and building our service in a way that people do."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "Kind of use in a very seamless, frictionless way in their day to day lives."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "And I think that does mean, you know, in some way falling in love in that product, right, just kind of becomes part of your routine."}, {"time": 4248,

behavior."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "And you get a lot of different things."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "And that is important."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "And if you're going to use it in your daily

call or do something else in the vehicle."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "And, you know, safety on the quality of the driving, as well as the physical safety of not having to share that ride is important to a lot of people."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "What about the idea that when there's somebody like a human driving, and they do a rolling stop on a stop sign, like sometimes like, you know, you get an Uber or Lyft or whatever, like human driver, and, you know, they can be a little bit aggressive as drivers."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "It feels like there's not all aggression is bad."}, {"time":

a timely fashion."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "I don't know if any of that made sense, but like, how does that fit into the experience of driving autonomously?"}, {"time": 4398, "text": "It's a lot of thoughts."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "This is you're hitting on a very important point of a number of behavioral components and, you know, parameters that make your driving feel assertive and natural

"text": "Let me be clear on that."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "But if you think of really, really good drivers, just think about professional lemon drivers, right?"}, {"time": 4427, "text": "They will follow the rules."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "They're very, very smooth, and yet they're very efficient."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "But they're assertive."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "They're comfortable for the people in the vehicle."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "They're predictable for the other people outside the vehicle that they share the environment with."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "And that's the kind of driver that we want to build."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And you think if maybe there's a sport analogy there, right?"}, {"time": 4451, "text": "You can do in very many sports, the true

precise, right?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "And they get the best results."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So that's the kind of driver that we want to build."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "In terms of, you

is a way to do both."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "And that's what we're doing."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "We're trying to build the driver that is safe, comfortable, smooth, and predictable."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "Yeah, that's a really interesting distinction."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I think in the early days of autonomous vehicles, the vehicles felt cautious as opposed to efficient."},

"text": "Like, yeah, then he's one of the surprising feelings was that it actually, it went fast."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "And it didn't feel like, awkwardly cautious than autonomous vehicle."},

when it was my code, or like, awkwardly cautious is the way I would put it."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "And Waymo's vehicle felt like, assertive and I think efficient is like the right terminology here."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "It wasn't, and I also like the professional limo driver, because we often think like, you know, an Uber driver or a bus driver or a taxi."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "This is the funny thing is people think they track taxi drivers are professionals."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "They, I mean, it's, it's like, that that's like saying, I'm a professional walker, just because I've been walking all my life."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "I think there's an art to it, right?"}, {"time": 4580, "text": "And if you take it seriously as an art form, then there's a certain way that mastery looks like."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "It's interesting to think about what does mastery look like in driving?"}, {"time": 4593, "text": "And perhaps what we associate with like aggressiveness is unnecessary, like, it's not part of the experience of driving."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "It's like, unnecessary fluff, that efficiency, you can be, you can create a good driving experience within the rules."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "That's, I mean, you're the first person to tell me this."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "So it's, it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "I need to think about this, but that's exactly what it felt like with Waymo."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "I kind of had this intuition."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Maybe it's the Russian thing."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "I don't know that you have to break the rules in life to get anywhere, but maybe, maybe it's possible that that's not the case in driving."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "I have to think about that, but it certainly felt that way on the streets of Phoenix when I was there in Waymo, that, that, that that was a very pleasant experience and it wasn't frustrating in that like, come on, move already kind of feeling."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "It wasn't, that wasn't there."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "I mean, that's what, that's what we're going after."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "I don't think you have to pick one."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "I think truly good driving."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "It gives you both efficiency, a certainness, but also comfort and predictability and safety."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "And, you know, it's, that's what fundamental improvements in the core capabilities truly unlock."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And you can kind of think of it as, you know, a precision and recall trade off."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "You have certain capabilities of your model."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "And then it's very easy when, you know, you have some curve of precision and recall, you can move things around and can choose your operating point and your training of precision versus recall, false positives versus false negatives."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "But then, and you know, you can tune things on that curve and be kind of more cautious or more aggressive, but then aggressive is bad or, you know, cautious is bad, but true capabilities come from actually moving the whole curve up."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "And then you are kind of on a very different plane of those trade offs."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "And that, that's what we're trying to do here is to move the whole curve up."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Before I forget, let's talk about trucks a little bit."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "So I also got a chance to check out some of the Waymo trucks."}, {"time": 4719, "text": "I'm not sure if we want to go too much into that space, but it's a fascinating one."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "So maybe we can mention at least briefly, you know, Waymo is also now doing autonomous trucking and how different like philosophically and technically is that whole space of problems."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "It's one of our two big products and you know, commercial applications of our driver, right?"}, {"time": 4746, "text": "Hailing and deliveries."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "You know, we have Waymo One and Waymo Via moving people and moving goods."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "You know, trucking is an example of moving goods."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "We've been working on trucking since 2017."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "It is a very interesting space."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "And your question of how different is it?"}, {"time": 4771, "text": "It has this really nice property that the first order challenges, like the science, the hard engineering, whether it's, you know, hardware or, you know, onboard software or off board software, all of the, you know, systems that you build for, you know, training your ML models for, you know, evaluating your time system."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "Like those fundamentals carry over."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "Like the true challenges of, you know, driving perception, semantic understanding, prediction, decision making, planning, evaluation, the simulator, ML infrastructure, those carry over."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "Like the data and the application and kind of the domains might be different, but the most difficult problems, all of that carries over between the domains."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "So that's very nice."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "So that's how we approach it."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "We're kind of build investing in the core, the technical core."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "And then there's specialization of that core technology to different product lines, to different commercial applications."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "So on just to tease it apart a little bit on trucks."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So starting with the hardware, the configuration of the sensors is different."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "They're different physically, geometrically, you know, different vehicles."}, {"time": 4846, "text": "So for example, we have two of our main laser on the trucks on both sides so that we have, you know, not have the blind spots."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "Whereas on the JLR eye pace, we have, you know, one of it sitting at the very top, but the actual sensors are almost the same."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "Now we're largely the same."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "So all of the investment that over the years we've put into building our custom lighters, custom radars, pulling the whole system together, that carries over very nicely."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Then, you know, on the perception side, the like the fundamental challenges of seeing, understanding the world, whether it's, you know, object detection, classification, you know, tracking, semantic understanding, all that carries over."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "You know, yes, there's some specialization when you're driving on freeways, you know, range becomes more important."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "The domain is a little bit different."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "But again, the fundamentals carry over very, very nicely."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Same, and you guess you get into prediction or decision making, right, the fundamentals of what it takes to predict what other people are going to do to find the long tail to improve your system in that long tail of behavior prediction and response that carries over right and so on and so on."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "So I mean, that's pretty exciting."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "By the way, does Waymo via include using the smaller vehicles for transportation of goods?"}, {"time": 4925, "text": "That's an interesting distinction."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "So I would say there's three interesting modes of operation."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "So one is moving humans, one is moving goods, and one is like moving nothing, zero occupancy, meaning like you're going to the destination, your empty vehicle."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "I mean, it's the third is the less of it."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "If that's the entirety of it, it's the less, you know, exciting from the commercial perspective."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "Well, I mean, in terms of like, if you think about what's inside a vehicle as it's moving, because it does, you know, some significant fraction of the vehicle's movement has to be empty."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "I mean, it's kind of fascinating."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Maybe just on that small point, is there different control and like policies that are applied for zero occupancy vehicle?"}, {"time": 4977, "text": "So vehicle with nothing in it, or is it just move as if there is a person inside?"}, {"time": 4984, "text": "What was with some subtle differences?"}, {"time": 4989, "text": "As a first order approximation, there are no differences."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "And if you think about, you know, safety and comfort and quality of driving, only part of it has to do with the people or the goods inside of the vehicle."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "But you don't want to be, you know, you want to drive smoothly, as we discussed, not for the purely for the benefit of whatever you have inside the car, right?"}, {"time": 5014, "text": "It's also for the benefit of the people outside kind of fitting naturally and predictably into that whole environment, right?"}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So, you know, yes, there are some second order things you can do, you can change your route, and you optimize maybe kind of your fleet, things at the fleet scale."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "And you would take into account whether some of your you know, some of your cars are actually, you know, serving a useful trip, whether with people or with goods, whereas, you know, other cars are, you know, driving completely empty to that next valuable trip that they're going to provide."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "But that those are mostly second order effects."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "So Phoenix is, is an incredible place."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "And what you've announced in Phoenix is, it's kind of amazing."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "But, you know, that's just like one city."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "How do you take over the world?"}, {"time": 5063, "text": "I mean, I'm asking for a friend."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "One step at a time."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "Is that a cartoon pinky in the brain?"}, {"time": 5075, "text": "But, you know, gradually is a true answer."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "So I think the heart of your question is, can you ask a better question than I asked?"}, {"time": 5088, "text": "You're asking a great question."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "Answer that one."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "I'm just gonna, you know, phrase it in the terms that I want to answer."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "You know, where are we today?"}, {"time": 5101, "text": "And, you know, what happens next?"}, {"time": 5101, "text": "And what does it take to go beyond Phoenix?"}, {"time": 5104, "text": "And what does it take to get this technology to more places and more people around the world, right?"}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So our next big area of focus is exactly that."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "Larger scale commercialization and just, you know, scaling up."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "If I think about, you know, the main, and, you know, Phoenix gives us that platform and gives us that foundation of upon which we can build."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "And it's, there are few really challenging aspects of this whole problem that you have to pull together in order to build the technology in order to deploy it into the field to go from a driverless car to a fleet of cars that are providing a service, and then all the way to commercialization."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "So, and then, you know, this is what we have in Phoenix."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "We've taken the technology from a proof point to an actual deployment and have taken our driver from, you know, one car to a fleet that can provide a service."}, {"time": 5185, "text": "Beyond that, if I think about what it will take to scale up and, you know, deploy in, you know, more places with more customers, I tend to think about three main dimensions, three main axes of scale."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "One is the core technology, you know, the hardware and software core capabilities of our driver."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "The second dimension is evaluation and deployment."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And the third one is the, you know, product, commercial, and operational excellence."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "So you can talk a bit about where we are along, you know, each one of those three dimensions about where we are today and, you know, what has, what will happen next."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "On, you know, the core technology, you know, the hardware and software, you know, together comprise a driver, we, you know, obviously have that foundation that is providing fully driverless trips to our customers as we speak, in fact."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "And we've learned a tremendous amount from that."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "So now what we're doing is we are incorporating all those lessons into some pretty fundamental improvements in our core technology, both on the hardware side and on the software side to build a more general, more robust solution that then will enable us to massively scale beyond Phoenix."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "So on the hardware side, all of those lessons are now incorporated into this fifth generation hardware platform that is, you know, being deployed right now."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "And that's the platform, the fourth generation, the thing that we have right now driving in Phoenix, it's good enough to operate fully driverlessly, you know, night and day, you know, various speeds and various conditions, but the fifth generation is the platform upon which we want to go to massive scale."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "We, in turn, we've really made qualitative improvements in terms of the capability of the system, the simplicity of the architecture, the reliability of the redundancy."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "It is designed to be manufacturable at very large scale and, you know, provides the right unit economics."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "So that's the next big step for us on the hardware side."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "That's already there for scale, the version five."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "And is that coincidence or should we look into a conspiracy theory that it's the same version as the pixel phone?"}, {"time": 5335, "text": "Is that what's the hardware?"}, {"time": 5339, "text": "They neither confirm nor deny."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So, sorry."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "So that's the, okay, that's that axis."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "So similarly, you know, hardware is a very discreet jump, but, you know, similar to how we're making that change from the fourth generation hardware to the fifth, we're making similar improvements on the software side to make it more, you know, robust and more general and allow us to kind of quickly scale beyond Phoenix."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "So that's the first dimension of core technology."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "How do you measure your system?"}, {"time": 5367, "text": "How do you evaluate it?"}, {"time": 5374, "text": "How do you build a release and deployment process where, you know, with confidence, you can, you know, regularly release new versions of your driver into a fleet?"}, {"time": 5385, "text": "How do you get good at it so that it is not, you know, a huge tax on your researchers and engineers that, you know, so you can, how do you build all these, you know, processes, the frameworks, the simulation, the evaluation, the data science, the validation, so that, you know, people can focus on improving the system and kind of the releases just go out the door and get deployed across the fleet."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "So we've gotten really good at that in Phoenix."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "That's been a tremendously difficult problem, but that's what we have in Phoenix right now that gives us that foundation."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "And now we're working on kind of incorporating all the lessons that we've learned to make it more efficient, to go to new places, you know, and scale up and just kind of, you know, stamp things out."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "So that's that second dimension of evaluation and deployment."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And the third dimension is product, commercial, and operational excellence, right?"}, {"time": 5433, "text": "And again, Phoenix there is providing an incredibly valuable platform."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "You know, that's why we're doing things end to end in Phoenix."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "We're learning, as you know, we discussed a little earlier today, tremendous amount of really valuable lessons from our users getting really incredible feedback."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "And we'll continue to iterate on that and incorporate all those lessons into making our product, you know, even better and more convenient for our users."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "So you're converting this whole process in Phoenix into something that could be copy and pasted elsewhere."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "So like, perhaps you didn't think of it that way when you were doing the experimentation in Phoenix, but so how long did you basically, and you can correct me, but you've, I mean, it's still early days, but you've taken the full journey in Phoenix, right?"}, {"time": 5484, "text": "As you were saying of like what it takes to basically automate."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "I mean, it's not the entirety of Phoenix, right?"}, {"time": 5491, "text": "But I imagine it can encompass the entirety of Phoenix."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "That's some near term date, but that's not even perhaps important."}, {"time": 5501, "text":

decision making, right?"}, {"time": 6499, "text": "So, how do you build a lot of systems?"}, {"time": 6502, "text": "So, we leverage ML very heavily in all of these components."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "I do believe that the best results you achieve by kind of using a hybrid approach and having different types of ML, having different models with different degrees of inductive bias that you can have, and combining kind of model, you know, free approaches with some model based approaches and some rule based, physics based systems."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So, you know, one example I can give you is traffic lights."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "There's a problem of the detection of traffic light state, and obviously that's a great problem for, you know, computer vision confidence, or, you know, that's their bread and butter, right?"}, {"time": 6545, "text": "That's how you build that."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "But then the interpretation of, you know, of a traffic light, that you're gonna need to learn that, right?"}, {"time": 6551, "text": "You don't need to build some, you know, complex ML model that, you know, infers with some, you know, precision and recall that red means stop."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "Like, it's a very clear engineered signal with very clear semantics, right?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "So you want to induce that bias, like how you induce that bias, and that whether, you know, it's a constraint or a cost, you know, function in your stack, but like it is important to be able to inject that, like, clear semantic signal into your stack."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "And, you know, that's what we do."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "And, but then the question of, like, and that's when you apply it to yourself, when you are making decisions whether you want to stop for a red light, you know, or not."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "But if you think about how other people treat traffic lights, we're back to the ML version of that."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "You know they're supposed to stop for a red light, but that doesn't mean they will."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "So then you're back in the, like, very heavy ML domain where you're picking up on, like, very subtle cues about, you know, they have to do with the behavior of objects, pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and the whole, you know, entire configuration of the scene that allow you to make accurate predictions on whether they will, in fact, stop or run a red light."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "So it sounds like already for Waymo, like, machine learning is a huge part of the stack."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "So it's a huge part of, like, not just, so obviously the first, the level zero, or whatever you said, which is, like, just the object detection of things that, you know, with no other machine learning can do, but also starting to do prediction behavior and so on to model the, what other, what the other parties in the scene, entities in the scene are going to do."}, {"time": 6651, "text": "So machine learning is more and more playing a role in that as well."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "I think we've been going back to the, you know, earliest days, like, you know, DARPA, the DARPA Grand Challenge, our team was leveraging, you know, machine learning."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "It was, like, pre, you know, ImageNet, and it was a very different type of ML,

6678, "text": "We've been driving in the desert, and it, we had built the model where it would kind of extend the range of free space reasoning."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "We get a clear signal from LiDAR, and then it had a model that said, hey, like, this stuff on camera kind of sort of looks like this stuff in LiDAR, and I know this stuff that I'm seeing in LiDAR, I'm very confident it's free space, so let me extend that free space zone into the camera range that would allow the vehicle to drive faster."}, {"time": 6703, "text": "And then we've been building on top of that and kind of staying and pushing the state of the art in ML, in all kinds of different ML over the years."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And in fact, from the early days, I think, you know, 2010 is probably the year

state of the art ML and self driving cars."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And they go hand in hand."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "And we've been on that journey ever since."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "We're

another example."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "In the Catholic Church, a lot of times, and I'm going to use the example of Faustina."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "She's a nun, and she's Polish."}, {"time":

people?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Is there a pattern to them?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "I think that for each era, it's different and people have...

things so that you can actually have the experience, like you were talking about earlier, of the thing in itself."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "And they call that Satori."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "So there are people who believe, you know, they try to..."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "They call it meditation, Zen meditation, and it's fairly radical, actually."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "In some

things to basically take you away from your conceptions of reality and bring you into a state of all that is, which is what they call Satori."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "And that has nothing to do with

my field, we have a few different definitions of religion, as you can imagine, just like philosophers have different definitions of what is real."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "So I take this definition and it comes from John Livingston."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And it's, religion is that set of beliefs and practices that is inspired by a transformative, what is perceived actually to be a transformative and sacred power."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So religion is a set of, it's not just belief, it's also practices."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "It's both belief and practices, because you won't have the practices without the belief."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "So you have those together, okay, and it's inspired by what is perceived, because we don't know if it's real or not, what is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "So perceived by the followers, or is this connected to the original sort of experience?"}, {"time": 2493, "text": "No, no, well, it's perceived by the followers."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "So, and that's the governing idea is that there's something of great power, perceived to be of great power, which you can connect

around?"}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Well, it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Many people would not agree with me, but I kind of see it as an evolutionary

2621, "text": "Well, it takes off because we're becoming a colonial power."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "That means we're going into other countries, we're conquering them."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "How

saying."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "When you say religion, I would use the word religiosity because I think that we're moving out of the dogmatic types of religions into more of a, I hate to put it

Nietzsche basically said God is dead."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And let me give you the context for him saying that."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "He also said this."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "He said there was only one Christian."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "He died on the cross, okay?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "So he despised Christianity."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And he said that...

did."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And Nietzsche basically was making a historical statement about God is dead."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "And he was right."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "He was basically saying that in the century in which he lived, and he died, I think, in 1900."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "Again, I could be wrong about that."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "So I just want to say that I believe he died in 1900."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Okay, so he's writing in the 1800s."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And he's basically saying God is dead, and we killed Him, okay?"}, {"time": 3224,

future."}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And he's speaking and writing to them, is my belief."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "So he's basically telling you and me, because we're now the philosophers of his

3308, "text": "So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen?"}, {"time": 3310, "text": "And so that's what he's basically saying, is that the basic anchor for Western society is now

out being agnostic."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Kind of believer."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "But agnostic, sort of open to the mysteries of the world."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "And I didn't think

of an angel."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "Okay, so we all think we know what an angel looks like."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "Well, we've been told what an angel looks like."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "We

the primary sources on either in Hebrew or in Greek or in whatever language and in Latin, and you look at experiences that people have talked about where they've written down their experiences about

but what forms can it possibly take?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So like I really love this idea that I tend to be humble in the face of all that we don't know and I tend to believe that the form alien life forms would take."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "And the way they would communicate is much more likely to be of a form that we can't even comprehend or perhaps can't even perceive directly."},

heck consciousness is."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "Like maybe consciousness itself is communication with aliens."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "Or like, I don't know, it could be just our own thoughts is actually the alien life forms communicating."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "Like, I know all that sounds crazy, but I'm saying like, I'm just trying to come up with the craziest possible thing that

way that's helpful for you to think about beyond the little green men?"}, {"time": 3991, "text": "It accords exactly with how I think, actually."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So I'll explain."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "I liked in American Cosmic, I attained the status of full professor."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "So I was like, OK, I can pretty much write this book like I want to do it."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So I used a lot of quotes from cool artists like David Bowie."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So David Bowie opens the book, and he basically says, and so does Nietzsche, by the way."},

think is absolutely correct."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "David Bowie said, the internet is an alien life form."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "OK, and if you've not seen David Bowie's interview where he says that, I highly recommend it."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "He's so brilliant."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "OK, so David Bowie is actually quite brilliant about the idea of UFOs."}, {"time": 4047,

right."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "So I started to think about it."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "OK, so he's a technologist."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "He has a Ph.D. in information technology from computer science, basically, from Northwestern."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "And he got that back in the day."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "You know, when I say back in the day, I'm not talking a thousand years ago."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "I'm talking like in the 60s."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "OK, so he's back when computer science wasn't really even the field you can get a degree."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "Yeah, he has a Ph.D. in it."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And he's French."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "He's from France, but he lives in Silicon Valley."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "And he

around brilliant guy, right?"}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And he's also interested in UFOs."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And most people take those two interests of his as separate interests."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And I remember being at a very small conference and listening to him, being in awe, of course, because he's an awe inspiring person, and then thinking, wait a minute, why do people compartmentalize those two things about him?"}, {"time": 4110, "text": "They're one in the same."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "OK, so when we talk about UFOs and UAPs and stuff, we have to talk about digital technology and things like that."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "And things like that."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "Now, if we're going back to what I so if I were to say what if I were to believe in and I like I said earlier, I was agnostic bordering on belief, most likely a believer in these this extraterrestrial or not extraterrestrial, let me put it another way, nonhuman intelligence that's communicating with us."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "I'm going to tell you how I think they communicate with us."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "And I go back to the Greeks again."}, {"time": 4144, "text":

understand."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Like, so only people with like, you know, in super amazing capacities, like poetic, creative, you know, intelligent, mathematical, whatever, you know, because they tend to do this symbolically."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "They tend to communicate with us in symbols form."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "And so music, you know, symbols, we've got math that are, you know, it's a symbolic language."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "And so what?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So, OK, so muses are probably a good idea for me of what this would be."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "Now, would muses have spaceships, you know, or those things that we call physical counterparts to what they are?"}, {"time": 4198, "text": "That's another question altogether."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "But if, you know, I know why would I think this?"}, {"time": 4202, "text": "Because if you look at the history, there are space programs, both Russian and American, you're going to find some pretty weird stuff, pretty weird history there, Lex."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "So you want to get an idea, go back to Tchaikovsky and read a little bit about what he has to say."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "If you look back at the history of our space programs, the viable space programs are both Russian and American, and each has an amazingly strange history because the founders of the calculations that got us up into space, the rocket scientists, basically, were doing some pretty weird rituals and doing religious things, right?"}, {"time": 4240, "text": "They weren't necessarily, like, Jack Parsons on our side was out in the desert with people like L. Ron Hubbard and doing really intense rituals, believing that they were opening stargates and things like that, OK?"}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And they were really doing that, OK?"}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So then you go to the Russian side, and they had a very specific non dogmatic, according to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity, idea of what Christianity was, and they believed that they were interacting with angels, nonhuman intelligences."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "So if you look back and you see muses, you can contextualize them within this tradition."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And so when I started to talk to people who were actually in the space program and who were in these programs that now the government has said, oh, yeah, we do have these programs, they have the same belief structures."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "They believe that they were also in contact with these nonhuman intelligences, and they were getting what they called downloads of information and creating, sometimes with Tyler Dee in my book, creating technologies that were real, and they were selling them on NASDAQ for a lot of money, like, say, $100 million or something like that, undisclosed amounts, but a lot."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "And these things are viable technologies that we use now, and they make our lives better, and we progress as a species because of them."}, {"time": 4320, "text":

Yeah."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "YARO And these, I like how we're putting angels, alien life forms, aliens, and technology all in the nonhuman intelligence camp, which I really like that because

{"time": 4566, "text": "And they would not talk to each other, but they would be having the same exact experience."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "So it was almost like having the same dream, right?"}, {"time": 4574, "text": "Okay, so somehow that whole event with Jacques there, and them talking about their experiences in these realms, of which religious studies people are quite familiar, by the way, because visionary experiences are what we study."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "So all of this seems super familiar to me, and I recognized that immediately that Jacques, that it hit me like, you know, very obvious that UFOs and these experiences and technology all seemed, they were all meshed together."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And I knew that I had to take them, I knew I had to read everything Jacques ever wrote."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And the best stuff he's written, by the way, is his little essays that he wrote in the 1970s, and they were peer reviewed essays about the beginning of the internet and how a lot of it was based on basically neural connection with the internet, like somehow psychic connection through the internet with others and things like that."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "So the brain is a biological neural network, there's this connection between visual neurons and so on, and that's what ultimately is able to have memories and has cognitive ability and is able to perceive the world and generate ideas."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "And those ideas are then spread on the internet, even from the very early days to other humans."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "So it gets injected or travels into the brains of other humans and that goes around in there and then spits out other stuff and it goes back and forth."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "So it's nice to think of the network that's in our mind, individual mind as, I mean, very much even deeply connected to the network that is the connection between humans through the internet."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "And so in that sense, Jacques saw the internet as this powerful, as a source of power and wisdom that is beyond our own."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Exactly, that's external to us, like if you could call it autonomous AI, right?"}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's nonhuman intelligence in a sense, even though humans are a part of it."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Yes, or we're invaded by it or whatever you want to call it."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "Yeah, whoever, right, it's the chicken and the egg, right."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So if I can go on, I don't want to experience things, I'm not done with that."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "So this is where I come to this idea that we're in this space, we're in now a new space of religion, of religiosity."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "So what happens is then, and it's like a biosphere and I'll talk about that in a minute."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "So Jacques takes us back, we get to San Francisco and my brother, who is your straight lace person, army guy and everything like that, I get into his car and the first thing he tells me is, I took ayahuasca and I was like, what?"}, {"time": 4744, "text": "And he goes, it's going to save humanity."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "As I mentioned to you offline, I talked to Matthew Johnson, he's a Hopkins professor and he's really a scholar of most, he's studied most drugs, he's also really deeply studied cocaine and all those stuff and negative effects and he's focused on a lot of positive effects of the different psychedelics."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So I'm very much interested in exploring the science of what these things do to the human mind and also personally exploring it."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Although it's like this weird gray area, which he's masterful at, which is he's a professor at John Hopkins, one of the most prestigious universities in the world and doing large scale studies of this stuff and until he got a lot of money for these studies, even in Hopkins itself, there's not much respect."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "It's not even respect, it was like people just didn't want to talk about it as a legitimate field of inquiry."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "It's kind of fascinating how hesitant we are as a little human civilization to legitimize the exploration of the mysterious, of whatever the definition of the mysterious is for that particular period of time."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So for us now, there's like little groups of things."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "I would say consciousness in the space of computer science research is something that's still like, I don't know, maybe let philosophers kick it around for a little longer."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And then certainly extraterrestrial life forms in most formulations of that problem space is still the other, it's still the source of the mysterious, except maybe like SETI, which is like, how can we detect signals from far away alien intelligences that we'll be able to perceive?"}, {"time": 4870, "text": "And psychedelics is another one of those that's like, we're starting to see, okay, well, can we try to see if there's some medical applications of like helping you get, like he does studies of help you quit smoking or help you in some kind of treatment of some disease."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "And he's sneaking into that, I mean, it's like openly sneaking into it, he's doing studies on it of like, how can you expand the mind with these tools and what can the mind discover through psychedelics and so on."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "And we're like slowly creeping into the space of being able to explore these mysterious questions."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "But it's like, it sucks that sometimes a lot of people have to die, meaning, sorry, they have to age out."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Like it's like faculty have, and people have a fixed set of ideas and they stick by them."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "In order for new ideas to come in, then the young folks have to be born with an open mind, the possibility of those ideas, and then they have to become old enough and get A's in school and whatever to then carry those ideas forward."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So the acceptance of the exploration of the mysterious takes time."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "It is sad."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "Maybe to go into my source of passion, which is artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "What's your sense about the possibility, like Pamela McCordick has this quote that I like, I talked to her a couple of years ago, I guess already on this podcast, that artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So do you think artificial intelligence may become the very kind of gods that were at the center of our, the religions of most of our history?"}, {"time": 4997, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot there."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "So I'm going to start by addressing this idea of artificial intelligence being separate from human beings."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "So I don't think that's actually, that might happen."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "You're talking about super artificial intelligence, like autonomous, conscious artificial intelligence?"}, {"time": 5024, "text": "Something with artificial consciousness."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "First of all, I think she's correct, but also there's an awesome quote."}, {"time": 5032, "text": "I'd also like to bring up this writer of fiction, actually, Ted Chiang, and one of his essays, he writes short essays."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "One of them was The Basis for the Movie Arrival, which if you haven't seen it, it's a really great movie about UFOs, and it has a very creative way of proposing an idea of how they might be able to communicate, first of all, how they appear to us, and second of all, how they may be communicating with us humans."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "The author Ted Chiang has a lot, I recommend his writings, his short stories."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "One is very short, and it appeared in Nature about 20 years ago, and it is called, I think it's called Eating the Crumbs from the Table or something like that, and it's basically this short essay, and I hate to do a spoiler here, but if you don't want to know what it's about, don't listen right now for five minutes."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "Yeah, spoiler alert."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "So this is what it's about."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "So basically it's about human beings becoming two different species, okay?"}, {"time": 5103, "text": "And one of them is created, they're called metahumans, and they start biohacking themselves with tech."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "Sound familiar?"}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So they do this, and they become metahumans and another species, right, and just kind of another fork, such that humans can barely understand them because they're so far removed."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "So in a sense, are they gods, right?"}, {"time": 5132, "text": "No, they're metahumans, they're superhumans, they're enhanced humans, okay?"}, {"time": 5135, "text": "I see that hopefully on the horizon, frankly."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "Not that we have two species, but that we can use our technology or we can become so integrated with our technology that we can survive, okay?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "We can survive the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "We can't go places now because of the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "Perhaps we can develop our bodies such that we can survive the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So there's this idea of these metahumans."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "Now, there's also this idea that technology is just another form of humans."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "We've created it, right?"}, {"time": 5171, "text": "And so maybe it is bent on surviving, thereby using us kind of as a meme or a team."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Some people are calling them teams now, these self generating, they're replicating themselves through us, okay?"}, {"time": 5184, "text": "I see that also, and I don't think that's terribly bad."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "It doesn't mean that we're evolving all the time, like we're taller than we used to be, we have different skills."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "So I don't see that as a bad thing."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "I think a lot of people see it as if we're not how we are now, it's a tragedy."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "But it's not a tragedy."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "How we are now is actually a tragedy for most people alive."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "Yeah, and we might be evolving in ways we can't possibly perceive."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "Like you said, that humans have created Twitter and Twitter may be changing us in ways that we can't even understand now, currently."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "From a perspective, if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter, that might be an organism that the organism understands what's happening from its level of perception."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "But we humans are just like the cells of the human body, we're interacting individually, but we're not actually aware of the big picture that's happening."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "And we naturally somehow, or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this, whatever one version of it is the evolutionary process, like biological evolution, whatever force that is, is just creating these greater and greater level of complexity, and maybe somehow not other kinds of non human intelligence are involved that we're calling alien intelligences."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "So just to step back, and we'll come back to AI, because I love the topic, but through American Cosmic and in general, you've interacted with much of the UFO community, you mentioned ufologists."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "By the way, is it ufologists or is it ufologists?"}, {"time": 5292, "text": "It's ufologists."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "Ufologists."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "So first of all, what is a ufologist?"}, {"time": 5297, "text": "And second of all, what have you learned about this community of ufologists?"}, {"time": 5303, "text": "Or also as you refer to them as the invisibles, or the members of the invisible college, or just in general, people who study UFOs from the different, all the different kinds of groups that study UFOs?"}, {"time": 5317, "text": "Generally, what I found is that they are okay, so people who are interested in UFOs from like being a kid, you know, and seeing some cool movie like Star Wars or something, and then they become interested, and then they study it as best they can, UFOs, or UAPs."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "They're generally an honest group of people who are using their tools, and they're generally two types of them."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "There are those who believe in the nuts and bolts, like the physical craft, and they believe in that these are things from other planets, okay?"}, {"time": 5350, "text": "So that's like the ETH hypothesis, you know."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "I'm sorry, ETH hypothesis, ETH is what we call it."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "Sorry about that."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "So this is like there's an actual spaceship, like something akin, but much more advanced than the rockets we use now."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "And there's some kind of, not necessarily biological, but something like biological organisms that travel on these spaceships."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "So this would be like what, to the Star Academy, is trying to decipher, like how, you know, how do they do it?"}, {"time": 5384, "text": "You know, maybe we could use that technology, the propulsion and things like that."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "They look at the rocket technology."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "Okay, so there are those, and then there are people who believe that it's more consciousness based, okay?"}, {"time": 5395, "text": "So these are your two types of ufologists who are known, and these are people who we know about."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And so they had to be really careful."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "So he called it the invisible college."}, {"time": 5433, "text": "So Hynek took that term and reused it, or what do you call it, repurposed it."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So he repurposed it."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "So they were still talking to each other, though."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "So what I found to be the case was that there was a group of people who were scientists but were not on the internet."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "You know, people today, and students of mine in particular, and my own kids, actually, they think that you only exist if you're on the internet or something only exists if it's on the internet."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "And that's, of course, untrue."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "And so what I found was that most people who are the most powerful people of our society and are doing things are not on the internet."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "You're not going to find any trace of them."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "So a lot of these people are what I call invisibles, people who are studying, at least their work is invisible."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "You might find them on the internet, but you're going to find that they're part of the bowling league or something like that."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "You will not find that they are actually engaged in research about this topic."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "And so I called them the invisibles because I was surprised to find them."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "And I thought, well, this is no longer the invisible college because these people are not even talking to each other."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "And that's why I reference this movie Fight Club."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "In it, you have an invisible, and his name is Tyler Durden, and he's incredible."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "He does incredible things."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "He's like a person who should not exist because he does so many things that are amazing."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "And so I found a person like that, and he's a real person."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "He's partially on the internet, but nothing that he does around that topic of UFOs is on the internet."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "So I decided to call him Tyler D after Tyler Durden."}, {"time": 5531, "text": "And so these people, I've termed the UFO Fight Club because they work together, but they don't know, in fact, his boss doesn't know what he does."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "They don't talk to each other because, you know, the first rule of Fight Club."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "Same as the second, yeah."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "You don't talk about people."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "No, you don't do it."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "Why do you have a sense that there's such a, I don't want to say fear, but a principle of staying out of the limelight?"}, {"time": 5559, "text": "I think there's something real, and I think that the use of it could be dangerous for people."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "Oh, sorry, you mean like something real, like there's actual, I don't know, what's the right terminology here to use it?"}, {"time": 5573, "text": "Alien technology, ideas about technology that are being explored that are dangerous have made public, that may become dangerous have made public."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So that's the word."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "You don't have to call it alien technology."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "You can call it ideas about alien technology because I don't know if it's actual alien technology or not."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "I honestly don't know."},

downloading this information."}, {"time": 5609, "text": "Whether or not they were, I don't, I mean, they definitely created the rocket technologies."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "How they did and whether their process was exactly what they said it was, I don't know."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "So this is the same thing today."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "So we've got some powerful technologies going on here."}, {"time": 5626, "text": "And of course we have a military and we have a military for a reason."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "Almost every government who needs a military has one."}, {"time":

"It's such a difficult question because this space, this particular space of technology, there's a gray area that I think is evolving over time."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "I think nuclear weapons change the game in terms of what should and shouldn't be secret."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "I think there's already technology that will enable us to destroy each other."}, {"time": 5685, "text": "And so there's some sense in which some technology should be made public."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "This is the same discussion of, you know, between companies, which part of your technology should you make public through like, for example, academic publications and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "Like how the Google search engine works, PageRank algorithm, or how the different deep learning, like there's pretty vibrant machine learning research communities within Google, Facebook and so on."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "And they release a lot of different ideas."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "It's an interesting question, like how dangerous is it to release some of the ideas?"}, {"time": 5720, "text": "I think it's a gray area that's constantly changing."}, {"time": 5724,

human usable."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "Like is there, in your mind, they're one in the same as like believing in alien craft and actually being in possession of an alien craft?"}, {"time": 5772,

that answer your question?"}, {"time": 5811, "text": "Like there's only so far belief goes in generating reality."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "I could be wrong, but this is what I think Jacques getting at."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "There are other ways to access places in reality other than what we consider to be physical."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "There's consciousness, okay?"}, {"time": 5843,

correspond to each other."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "Now how do we make sense of that?"}, {"time": 5868, "text": "So do these places actually exist?"}, {"time": 5872, "text": "In a sense, I think they do."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And so I think that, let's take that very famous case of a Virgin Mary apparition in Fatima where I think there was like a lot of people, thousands and thousands, if not like I think 50,000 or something like that, a lot of people gathered to see what's now called the miracle of Fatima, which was the spinning of the sun."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "Well, a lot of people

absolutely, however, I think we have to be really careful about those because young people or people in general, I should say, absolutely can get hurt by them."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "I mean, but we get hurt by alcohol, you know, we drive our cars and we kill each other."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "But psychedelics are really interesting because I know that within the history of our country, we

found was this, I found that as the most interesting part of the creation of this movie was the editing process because it would go through editing and they would use test audiences and a lot of the

really intense, they go to UC Irvine and they do this thing called cognitive consumption, which is basically, or I'm sorry, cognitive consumerism, where they basically hook test audiences up to EKGs

truth is like what I said, Brother Guy said, it's a moving target, okay?"}, {"time": 9546, "text": "We started this whole conversation with what's real, right?"}, {"time": 9549, "text": "So I should

appreciated his critique, I thought it was actually quite accurate."}, {"time": 9602, "text": "He's a critique of religion in general and he's fascinating."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And also I find that he talks about altered states of consciousness and he calls them elevated states."}, {"time": 9614, "text": "And I think through his book, you can actually experience elevated states."}, {"time":

sent the Jews to the concentration camps who ran the trains, okay?"}, {"time": 9674, "text": "And she said, the thing about Eichmann was that he didn't seem particularly evil."}, {"time": 9679,

she said, and he used a lot of stereotypes like memes."}, {"time": 9691, "text": "So she actually wrote about memes before we had them."}, {"time": 9694, "text": "And now people just use memes and they're actually used against us even."}, {"time": 9698, "text": "There's even a segments of warfare called memetic warfare, all right?"}, {"time": 9702, "text": "So memes are something that can sway

9722, "text": "And I don't think anybody will read it, but frankly, it's one of the best books I've ever read."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "And I've read it many times."}, {"time": 9729, "text": "And basically, The Life of the Mind, in The Life of the Mind, she asks a very simple question."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "She says, why do people do bad things?"}, {"time": 9735, "text": "Why are they evil?"}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And what she says is she wonders if it's, she says that bad people sleep well at night contrary to, you know how the saying, how do you sleep at night?"}, {"time": 9745, "text": "Well, that's only because you're a good person that you're asking that question because you actually have a conscience and a conscience is this dual kind of, you fight with yourself about the consequences of your actions."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "And she says, bad people don't seem to have a conscience."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "Do they actually sleep well at night?"},

way."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "But I think his best book or the one that impacted me the most is called Authors of the Impossible."}, {"time": 9789, "text": "And his book, his writing is very much like Nietzsche's writing in the sense that he, it's almost as if he reaches out of the pages and he grabs you and he kind of slaps you around and says, think about this, you know, and you can't help

why that is."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "It feels like similar with Ayn Rand or something like that, where like this is, I should say not dangerous, but controversial."}, {"time": 9875, "text": "Yes, they think it's controversial."}, {"time": 9876, "text": "This is the reason I believe, I've heard of the controversy."}, {"time": 9880, "text": "The controversy is that she didn't, first of all, she is Jewish and she did escape a concentration camp and yet she's called, she's been called anti Jewish."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "And I think part of that was that she basically was saying something that I believe that a lot of normal people are like Eichmann and evil things are done by people who just follow the rules and they don't think about what they're doing."}, {"time": 9912, "text": "And that's one of the most pernicious forms of evil of our time."}, {"time": 9918, "text": "So we talked quite a bit about the definitions of religion and what are the different building blocks of religion."}, {"time": 9961, "text": "So what are your thoughts in the context of religion or maybe in the context of your own mind about the role of death in life or fear of death in life and are you

why?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Because you gotta toughen you up."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "That's a weakness, water."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And so we would go through practice."}, {"time": 1015,

wrestling."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You're setting against the wall."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Because you're tired."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So then all of a sudden they say, okay, go ahead and

this guy."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "He's not gonna stop."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Well, he was out in the yard."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And he was swinging baseball bats."}, {"time": 1103,

even there throwing the ball."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "That all of a sudden when they walked by, all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt on both sides."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So it's like, they saw me out in the yard playing by myself sports, or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "But if they weren't there, if you walked in my front room, I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And I was running and running through the furniture, that type stuff."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And the coaches at the YMCA level, the junior high level, they saw this guy come first and end up last."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But I wasn't that great."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "I wasn't the fastest guy at that time."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And I wasn't the strongest guy."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Actually, before I went to the Olympics, when they tested me, they tested everybody."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And I probably came back with one of the highest scores, but it was not like the highest person on this and this and that."},

board."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And so I really didn't have too many flaws, but I didn't have any things that also said that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic games."}, {"time": 1203,

zero points scored on you."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "57, zero."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So maybe take me through almost the details."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What was your routine?"}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What was your process?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "What was going through your mind, your thoughts of that day?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day because we weighed in every day at that time."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "In the morning?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Yeah, we weighed in two hours before the start of the competition."}, {"time": 1241, "text":

day, I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So had all day to recover, but I didn't really need it anyway, because I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight, but it was just interesting."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "But what was in your mind?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "What were you thinking?"}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Were you?"}, {"time": 1265,

know it from a cocky point of view."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "I only knew it because for the last one, two, three and a half years, I had been going to practice, and I'd win in every practice."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "You felt good, you won."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And I hardly ever lose a takedown."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And if I lost, if somebody scored on me, it was like when I went to bed, I couldn't sleep until I figured it out."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Or if I didn't figure it out, I would fall asleep and I would wake up with the answer of what I needed, why I got scored upon."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So maybe now that you've won the gold, can you tell me in the practice room when somebody took you down, how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?"}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Timing, technique?"}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Very difficult, but somebody could, because they were going for one move."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "All I wanted was one move."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Whereas if you can arrest somebody, arrest them the whole practice or half a practice for at least 10, 15 minutes, and they were maybe gonna score if they could work it in their mind."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "But they knew that was gonna be their victory."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me, at that, when you're going for the Olympic gold, you didn't want to allow any takedowns."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position, a weak point or something."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "It's important to not let down, take down."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "It's kind of like what we were saying before."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "If something happened and somebody scored on me in a certain way, I would go over that situation, over that situation, over it again, and I would come up with an answer."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And then I would actually test it."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day because I didn't want the guy to not have some, I didn't want him to think that I was thinking about it all night, I didn't tell him."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But maybe three days later when he wrestled again, I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move, and I got stopped and didn't score, I had to go back and filter that."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I could usually solve it."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Let's go back to the Olympic games."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So I get up in the Olympic in the morning and I'm not sure when the weigh ins were, but I think I was probably a pound over."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And that's about a half a kilo and 1.1 pounds is a kilo because we went in kilograms."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So what do you do with that pound?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "You aren't off or?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "No, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there and I got in the sauna."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And the funny thing was the morning of the finals, there was another athlete in the sauna."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "And it was American or?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "No, it was a European."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I don't remember where she was from."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Not a Russian."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And she didn't have her top on."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And that was pretty common."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And so, you know, it was kind of interesting."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "You think back about it because there's some funny things that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games, in world games, anytime when you have country against country."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Did any of it affect you?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Was there any?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "You lost a little bit over a pound."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "I lost a little more than a pound."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "But it didn't really bother me because I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "So your match against the Russian, the...

incredible wrestler."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So what was going through your mind before stepping on the mat with that guy?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers, haven't had a point scored on you."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And you're stepping on the mat against this Russian who you said was really, they picked, the Soviets picked to beat you."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Right, and I know why they picked him because he had a great attitude."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So he wasn't just the typical artist."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "He was a good artist."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "He hooked elbows like Azhelyov."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And he's from that area of the world where they have some of those types of moves."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "But he, and he was a goer, but by cutting him down a weight, he lost some of that go."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "And I don't know if, you gotta, that's a process you gotta go about scientifically."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And so, if you don't do it as an American, it can really hurt your performance."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "If you don't do it as a Russian, it can hurt your performance."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And they already didn't really do that a lot where you usually wrestle the weight where it was more like your weight."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And so by cutting him down, maybe slowed his belief down a little bit."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So you saw it in him."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "Yeah, but then he came back and he won rest of the matches and he was in the round robin and he was able to go to the finals, but he had lost another match actually against in the round robin against the Japanese."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So I think I had already gained enough of artistic, being able to finish a match."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Once I lost my match in college for the last two years, I took on some of that artistic work."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And I think that he was already hoping to win, but he was hoping to win by a long ways because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points to be able to win the gold."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And that wasn't gonna happen."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "I can't remember too many that I took that would actually put me in a danger position."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "I've taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically, technically correct that I wouldn't land in that danger zone."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "It's like, if I'm gonna lock up and throw you, I'm not gonna throw you to my own back and roll you through."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "I'm gonna turn in the air."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So you were scientific about it."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I learned the hard way."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling that you did that exposed your shoulders, which it cost me in some early freestyle matches against great wrestlers."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves to where I hit a Granby roll where you expose your shoulders and you lose two points every time."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "But you learn that that's not the system."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "But if you hadn't wrestled much, you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "You would hit it."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So you won the gold."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "I think it would have, I think the question would be how would it feel if you lost the gold for me?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Because I already went through that once."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Not at that highest level, but the National Collegiate Championship level my senior year."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "The Larry Owings loss."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Larry Owings, yeah."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And that didn't sit well."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Were you afraid of that happening again at the Olympic level?"}, {"time": 1725, "text": "Was that even a thought?"}, {"time": 1726, "text": "No, I really wasn't."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "But it was why I changed my philosophy of training and added to the scientific artist type."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And if I had won that match, even though I wouldn't have felt good about it, even though I squeaked it out, I wasn't feeling good about that match."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "It would have affected me a little bit, but if I'd have won it, I would have got over it."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "I mean, I'm not over it now."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff right before my match."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "By that, I mean this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Interviews, yeah, journalists."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker then."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now, except for I got a little cold, but I don't think I could say two words hardly then."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And they took takes."},

wasn't like I just said it."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "You know, that type of stuff."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So, and he finally just closed the book and said, yeah, that's good enough."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "But I turned and it was my time to wrestle."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And so, you know, you just, you learn that, and for me it was great coaching experience because that's what I turned into be."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And I put out a lot of champions, but you learn through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made, you know, it's an ever learning process."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "It's an ever learning process."},

I'm sure fear is out there."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "He had these doubts."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "He probably had these doubts."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And that gives me the edge."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "And I don't know if I really ever had fear, but obviously there was points in times where I didn't perform as well, not many, but a few."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And if I look back of it, look back at it, I don't think it was that American, you know, raw, raw, raw stuff."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "I think it was probably the fear of not being an artist as much."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "You know, maybe this guy might be better than me scientifically."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "And you know, you're a scientist."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "I think that got to me more than anything else."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "I said early on that I want to eliminate ever having to worry about getting tired in a match."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So I kind of eliminated that."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "So I got rid of that point."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "And I do think that in wrestling, that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have, actually how they feel during the match and are they gonna get tired and is it gonna affect my performance?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And as a coach, that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my athletes."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So there wasn't that fear factor, but that fear factor would be put upon my opponent, which would give me an edge."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "But that's not what I needed as much."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I needed to just focus, make sure that I was doing the right things."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "And I needed my team to be focused."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete or even as a coach sometimes, that I didn't repeat them."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Didn't repeat them."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it, then it's like you didn't learn anything."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Your goal throughout your wrestling career, as you've beautifully put, was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?"}, {"time": 1972, "text": "That you would be carried off the mat."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So you never did successfully in, that's one of the ways you failed in your career is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Have you ever come close?"}, {"time": 1982, "text": "Do you remember a time that you've come close that you've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?"},

said that to my athletes, I don't know, I could get in trouble."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Because, you know, it's like."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "But it's understood, isn't it, by the athletes?"}, {"time": 2006, "text": "Yeah, they understand it."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "But the outside might not understand it."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "Because it's almost like, what do you mean there?"}, {"time": 2014, "text": "You push them to the point where they go collapse."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "It means they may die or something might happen to them."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "And, you know, that's dangerous."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "But it's something that's highly unlikely that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "But I'm gonna tell you, there's many times in a practice where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden the whistle blew or it was time to stop."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at and I needed water, I needed fresh air, because you're usually in a fairly small room with a lot of guys that the heat rises and it's hard to breathe."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times not by the door, the far end of the room."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "I can remember walking from the far end of the room to that door."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "And I can remember, am I gonna make it the next step?"}, {"time": 2067, "text": "Am I gonna make it the next step?"}, {"time": 2068, "text": "I need air, I need water, I need oxygen, I need to get out of here."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "It didn't happen often, but I can recount four or five times in my career that I pushed myself to that level where I thought I was gonna maybe go out, but every step I was dizzy."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "But once I got to that door, I was able to open it and go out and grab the water and get cold water in my face."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And so, no, I never really was able to do that."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "And I think the story is in a book where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "It made you proud."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "Oh my gosh, and she didn't win."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "But she pushed a collapse."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "Now, did she suffer because of that?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Well, she didn't get to go to the next event because she had to qualify."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "But I think it probably helped her too, realizing because she was winning the race and she was beating people she normally never pushed, but she was at a new level that she had never been before and she only needed about five feet to finish."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And it was just one of those things that I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And it probably made her realize that she could be better, but she had to hold up though."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "So you mentioned in Wrestling Life that the Brands Brothers looked up to Roy Salger, who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling, but not getting too rough."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling, but at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?"}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "I think anger would cause you to make mistakes and actually get out of position because I think anger is kind of a loss of control."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And there can be a furious type of attack, but I think if it crosses the line to anger, then you're gonna be vulnerable."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge, through the edge, but when the whistle blew, they stopped."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "And there's people that when the whistle blows, they keep going."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "It's like in a football game, a fight breaks out and it's after the whistles blow."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "So that whistle was something that in a match, that kind of gave them the boundaries."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got from Mike Chapman, the new edition, talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "And how he talked about how my strength, speed and ability to think were increased tremendously by just sitting apart from the action prior to the match and getting into a state of controlled anger."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "So can anger, controlled, so anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "You had that line."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "One side of the line, you can have an anger for performance and the other side of the line, if you go beyond that, it's not gonna be for performance."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "It's gonna be for not performance because you're gonna lose points."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "It's a fine line."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "There's definitely a fine line."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "You're talking about Roy Selger."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "You're talking about Tom Brands."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "You're talking about Terry Brands."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "I mean, you got world championship titles there."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "You got Olympic championship title there."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "You got a world silver medalist in Roy Selger."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "And when I talked to him about the world silver medalist, he's haunted by that."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "Cause he was actually 20 seconds away from winning when he got beat in the end there, but that's part of the game."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "And I don't know whether he's okay with it or not."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Cause he says every, after talking about things, he goes, I'm okay with it now."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "But then he keeps talking about it."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "So I don't really think he's okay with it."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "And it's hard for him to actually make amends to himself when you really don't do it."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "I mean, it's no matter what the situation, even with the Owings loss."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "Yeah, it still eats it."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "He's not, and he wanted to be."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "I'm Olympic champion."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "He's not, he wanted to be."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "One of the greatest coaches of all time."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And so, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "Because you don't get over those things."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "So Roy really keeps going back to it, even though he says he's fine."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "But then he realizes he's really not fine because that's just the nature of the game."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "And that's why he was able to win national titles and make world teams and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "What's interesting about him, he's analyzed all the people that he's wrestled, and a lot of them have won world and Olympic championships."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And he didn't get to that world championship gold or Olympic gold."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "And he says it because they did it."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "So he's showing people that I beaten those guys."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "But apparently he didn't beat them at the right time."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "And so it's still haunting."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "You don't get away from that stuff."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "I mean, you think I'm ever gonna get over the murder of my sister?"}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And you might not even know that."}, {"time":

sister, your older sister, on May 31st, 1964, was raped and murdered by a local boy."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day, do they ripple through your life still?"}, {"time": 2460, "text": "Through your wrestling, through your coaching, through the way you, when you wake up in the morning?"}, {"time": 2469, "text": "It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And it can be the mood I'm in."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "It can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew or maybe if I've had a Gable beer."}, {"time":

it out?"}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And hopefully it's nothing that you do to the extreme point to where it brings it out."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "For me, it's not extreme."}, {"time": 2514, "text":

well developed because I was only a sophomore, 15 years old in high school."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And I had parents that weren't making it."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "And my parents are a lot older than me."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "And now that we're down just to me and my parents, and I'm gonna be around the house for another two years."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And they had just lost

mean?"}, {"time": 2577, "text": "Well, then everybody said that something to me about my sister just three weeks before that, that really wasn't normal or practical."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "And I said nothing to nobody."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Is there a part of you that blames yourself?"}, {"time": 2600, "text": "But I'm 15 years old and you make mistakes."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And you don't really act on everything that happens in your life."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "But I can tell you how it affected me."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "And I acted a lot on anything that maybe wasn't even of that consequence."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "I mean, cause I had four daughters and I'm telling you when they left every time to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace, I always said something to them."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And they would always say, dad, you said that last night."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "What, like I love you or like be careful?"}, {"time": 2634,

she had been murdered, it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And he looked at me and he just like,

lot of choices and I don't, I took the word choice out of my life and I just like to say, okay, do the right thing, do the thing that you should do."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "And so I don't really,

that choice."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "Just give me the right way to go."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And so not that I've been perfect by any means, but it's made a big difference in my life on how I

made the fastest one you could and then people started to have power limits."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So then you made the fastest at the right PowerPoint."}, {"time": 977, "text": "And then when we started doing multi processors, like if you could scale your processors more than the other guy, you could be 10% faster on like a single thread, but you have more threads."}, {"time": 988, "text":

Yeah, it's a lot of different."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "So what's the difference in the ARM folks and Intel in terms of the way they're approaching this problem?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Well, Intel, almost all their processor designs were, you know, very custom high end, you know, for the last 15, 20 years."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So the fastest horse possible."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "In one horse race."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "Yeah, and then architecturally they're really good, but the company itself was fairly insular to what's going on in the industry with CAD tools and stuff."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And there's this debate about custom design versus synthesis and how do you approach that?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "I'd say Intel was slow on getting to synthesize processors."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "ARM came in from the bottom and they generated IP, which went to all kinds of customers."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "So they had very little say on how the customer implemented their IP."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So ARM is super friendly to the synthesis IP environment."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Whereas Intel said, we're gonna make this great client

winning the mobile platform space in terms of process?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And so in that, what you're describing is why they're winning."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Well, they had lots of people doing lots of different experiments."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "So they controlled the processor architecture and IP, but they let people put in lots of different chips."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And there was a lot of variability in what happened there."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Whereas Intel, when they made their mobile, their foray into mobile, they had one team doing one part, right?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So it wasn't 10 experiments."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "And then their mindset was PC mindset, Microsoft software mindset."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "And that brought a whole bunch of things along that the mobile world and the embedded world don't do."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Do you think it was possible for Intel to pivot hard and win the mobile market?"},

dozen innovations."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "But as they scaled up the number of computers on that, it kept breaking, finding new bottlenecks in their software and their schedulers, and made them

there's parallel computers."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So the way I think about it is, you know, parallel computers have given parallelism."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Like, GPUs are great because you have a million pixels, and modern GPUs run a program on every pixel."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "They call it the shader program, right?"}, {"time": 3039, "text": "So, or like finite element analysis."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "You build something, you know, you make this into little tiny chunks, you give each chunk to a computer, so you're given all these chunks, you have parallelism like that."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "But most C programs, you write this linear narrative, and you have to make it go fast."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "To make it go fast, you predict all the

this is."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "It's a given parallelism problem."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But the way people describe the neural networks, and then how they write them in PyTorch, it makes graphs."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Yeah, that might be fundamentally different than the GPU kind of."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Parallelism, yeah, it might be."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "Because when you run the GPU program on all the pixels, you're running, you know, it depends, this group of pixels say it's background blue, and it runs a really simple program."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "This pixel is, you know, some patch of your face, so you have some really interesting shader program to give you the impression of translucency."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "But the pixels themselves don't talk to each other."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "There's no graph, right?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So you do the image, and then you do the next image, and you do the next image, and you run eight million pixels, eight million programs every time, and modern GPUs have like 6,000 thread engines in them."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "So, you know, to get eight million pixels, each one runs a program on, you know, 10 or 20 pixels."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And that's how they work, but there's no graph."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "But you think graph might be a totally new way to think about hardware."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "So Rajagat Dori and I have been having this conversation about given versus found parallelism."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "And then the kind of walk, because we got more transistors, like, you know, computers way back when did stuff on scalar data."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "Now we did it on vector data, famous vector machines."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Now we're making computers that operate on matrices, right?"}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And then the category we said that was next was spatial."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Like, imagine you have so much data that, you know, you want to do the compute on this data, and then when it's done, it says, send the result to this pile of data on some software on that."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And it's better to think about it spatially than to move all the data to a central processor and do all the work."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So spatially, you mean moving in the space of data as opposed to moving the data."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "Yeah, you have a petabyte data space spread across some huge array of computers."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And when you do a computation somewhere, you send the result of that computation or maybe a pointer to the next program to some other piece of data and do it."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "But I think a better word might be graph."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And all the AI neural networks are graphs."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Do some computations, send the result here, do another computation, do a data transformation, do a merging, do a pooling, do another computation."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "Is it possible to compress and say how we make this thing efficient, this whole process efficient, this different?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So first, the fundamental elements in the graphs are things like matrix multiplies, convolutions, data manipulations, and data movements."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So GPUs emulate those things with their little singles, you know, basically running a single threaded program."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "And then there's, you know, and NVIDIA calls it a warp where they group a bunch of programs that are similar together."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So for efficiency and instruction use."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "And then at a higher level, you kind of, you take this graph and you say this part of the graph is a matrix multiplier, which runs on these 32 threads."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "But the model at the bottom was built for running programs on pixels, not executing graphs."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "So it's emulation, ultimately."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So is it possible to build something that natively runs graphs?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Yes, so that's what 10storrent did."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "Where are we on that?"}, {"time": 3268, "text": "How, like, in the history of that effort, are we in the early days?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "10storrent started by a friend of mine, Labisha Bajek, and I was his first investor."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So I've been, you know, kind of following him and talking to him about it for years."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And in the fall when I was considering things to do, I decided, you know, we held a conference last year with a friend, organized it, and we wanted to bring in thinkers."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "And two of the people were Andre Carpassi and Chris Ladner."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And Andre gave this talk, it's on YouTube, called Software 2.0, which I think is great."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Which is, we went from programmed computers, where you write programs, to data program computers."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "You know, like the future of software is data programs, the networks."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "And I think that's true."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then Chris has been working, he worked on LLVM, the low level virtual machine, which became the intermediate representation for all compilers."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And now he's working on another project called MLIR, which is mid level intermediate representation, which is essentially under the graph about how do you represent that kind of computation and then coordinate large numbers of potentially heterogeneous computers."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And I would say technically, Tens Torrents, you know, two pillars of those two ideas, software 2.0 and mid level representation."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "But it's in service of executing graph programs."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "The hardware is designed to do that."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "So it's including the hardware piece."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "And then the other cool thing is, for a relatively small amount of money, they did a test chip and two production chips."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "So it's like a super effective team."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And unlike some AI startups, where if you don't build the hardware to run the software that they really want to do, then you have to fix it by writing lots more software."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So the hardware naturally does matrix multiply, convolution, the data manipulations, and the data movement between processing elements that you can see in the graph, which I think is all pretty clever."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "And that's what I'm working on now."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "So the, I think it's called the Grace Call Processor."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "I introduced last year."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "It's, you know, there's a bunch of measures of performance."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "We're talking about horses."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "It seems to outperform 368 trillion operations per second."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "It seems to outperform NVIDIA's Tesla T4 system."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "So these are just numbers."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "What do they actually mean in real world performance?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Like what are the metrics for you that you're chasing in your horse race?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Like what do you care about?"}, {"time": 3433, "text": "Well, first, so the native language of, you know, people who write AI network programs is PyTorch now, PyTorch, TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "There's a couple others."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "Do you think PyTorch is one over TensorFlow?"}, {"time": 3446, "text": "I'm not an expert on that."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "I know many people who have switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "And there's technical reasons for it."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "I use both."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "Both are still awesome."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "But the deepest love is for PyTorch currently."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "Yeah, there's more love for that."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And that may change."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So the first thing is when they write their programs, can the hardware execute it pretty much as it was written?"}, {"time": 3470, "text": "Right, so PyTorch turns into a graph."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "We have a graph compiler that makes that graph."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "Then it fractions the graph down."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "So if you have big matrix multiply, we turn it into right size chunks to run on the processing elements."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "It hooks all the graph up."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "It lays out all the data."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "There's a couple of mid level representations of it that are also simulatable."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "So that if you're writing the code, you can see how it's gonna go through the machine, which is pretty cool."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And then at the bottom, it schedules kernels, like math, data manipulation, data movement kernels, which do this stuff."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "So we don't have to write a little program to do matrix multiply, because we have a big matrix multiplier."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "There's no SIMD program for that."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "But there is scheduling for that, right?"}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So one of the goals is, if you write a piece of PyTorch code that looks pretty reasonable, you should be able to compile it, run it on the hardware without having to tweak it and do all kinds of crazy things to get performance."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "There's not a lot of intermediate steps."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "It's running directly as written."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Like on a GPU, if you write a large matrix multiply naively, you'll get five to 10% of the peak performance of the GPU."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "Right, and then there's a bunch of people who've published papers on this, and I read them about what steps do you have to do."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And it goes from pretty reasonable, well, transpose one of the matrices."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "So you do row ordered, not column ordered, block it so that you can put a block of the matrix on different SMs, groups of threads."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "But some of it gets into little details, like you have to schedule it just so, so you don't have register conflicts."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So they call them CUDA ninjas."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "CUDA ninjas, I love it."}, {"time": 3571, "text": "To get to the optimal point, you either use a prewritten library, which is a good strategy for some things, or you have to be an expert in micro architecture to program it."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "Right, so the optimization step is way more complicated with the GPU."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So our goal is if you write PyTorch, that's good PyTorch, you can do it."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Now there's, as the networks are evolving, they've changed from convolutional to matrix multiply."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "People are talking about conditional graphs, they're talking about very large matrices, they're talking about sparsity, they're talking about problems that scale across many, many chips."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "So the native data item is a packet."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So you send a packet to a processor, it gets processed, it does a bunch of work, and then it may send packets to other processors, and they execute in like a data flow graph kind of methodology."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "We have a big network on chip, and then the second chip has 16 ethernet ports to hook lots of them together, and it's the same graph compiler across multiple chips."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "So that's where the scale comes in."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So it's built to scale naturally."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Now, my experience with scaling is as you scale, you run into lots of interesting problems."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So scaling is the mountain to climb."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So the hardware is built to do this, and then we're in the process of."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "Is there a software part to this with ethernet and all that?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "Well, the protocol at the bottom, we sent, it's an ethernet PHY, but the protocol basically says, send the packet from here to there."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "It's all point to point."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "The header bit says which processor to send it to, and we basically take a packet off our on chip network, put an ethernet header on it, send it to the other end to strip the header off, and send it to the local thing."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "It's pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Human to human interaction is pretty straightforward too, but when you get a million of us, we could do some crazy stuff together."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "Yeah, it's gonna be fun."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So is that the goal is scale?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "So like, for example, I've been recently doing a bunch of robots at home for my own personal pleasure."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "Am I going to ever use 10th Story, or is this more for?"}, {"time": 3695, "text": "There's all kinds of problems."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Like, there's small inference problems, or small training problems, or big training problems."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "What's the big goal?"}, {"time": 3702, "text": "Is it the big training problems, or the small training problems?"}, {"time": 3706, "text": "Well, one of the goals is to scale from 100 milliwatts to a megawatt, you know?"}, {"time": 3711, "text": "So like, really have some range on the problems, and the same kind of AI programs work at all different levels."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So that's the goal."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "The natural, since the natural data item is a packet that we can move around, it's built to scale, but so many people have small problems."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "But the, you know."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Like, inside that phone is a small problem to solve."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "So do you see 10th Story potentially being inside a phone?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "Well, the power efficiency of local memory, local computation, and the way we built it is pretty good."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And then there's a lot of efficiency on being able to do conditional graphs and sparsity."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "I think it's, for complicated networks that wanna go in a small factor, it's gonna be quite good."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "But we have to prove that, that's all."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "It's a fun problem."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "And that's the early days of the company, right?"}, {"time": 3762, "text": "It's a couple years, you said?"}, {"time": 3764, "text": "But you think, you invested, you think they're legit."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And so you joined."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Yeah, I joined."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "That's a really interesting place to be."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "Like, the AI world is exploding, you know."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "And I looked at some other opportunities like build a faster processor, which people want."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "But that's more on an incremental path than what's gonna happen in AI in the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "So this is kind of, you know, an exciting place to be part of."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "Yeah, the revolutions will be happening in the very space that Tesla is."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And then lots of people are working on it, but there's lots of technical reasons why some of them, you know, aren't gonna work out that well."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "And, you know, that's interesting."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "And there's also the same problem about getting the basics right."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "Like, we've talked to customers about exciting features."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And at some point we realized that, Labish and I were realizing they want to hear first about memory bandwidth, local bandwidth, compute intensity, programmability."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "They want to know the basics, power management, how the network ports work, what are the basics, do all the basics work."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Because it's easy to say, we've got this great idea, you know, the crack GPT3, but the people we talked to want to say, if I buy the, so we have a PCI Express card with our chip on it, if you buy the card, you plug it in your machine to download the driver, how long does it take me to get my network to run?"}, {"time": 3845, "text": "You know, that's a real question."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "It's a very basic question."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Is there an answer to that yet, or is it trying to get to that?"}, {"time": 3851, "text": "Our goal is like an hour."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "When can I buy a Tesla?"}, {"time": 3856, "text": "Pretty soon."}, {"time": 3857, "text":

3887, "text": "They educate large numbers of people, and they've created platforms for other people to go do their stuff on."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Yeah, the clear thinking that's able to be communicated is kind of impressive."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "It's kind of remarkable to, yeah, I'm a fan."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "Well, let me ask, because I talk to Chris actually a lot these days."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "He's been one of the, just to give him a shout out, he's been so supportive as a human being."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "So everybody's quite different."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "Like great engineers are different, but he's been like sensitive to the human element in a way that's been fascinating."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "Like he was one of the early people on

it, let's see what turns out."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "That's a pretty powerful thing."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "But what do you, what's your sense about, he used to be, no, I think stepped away

the right place."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "And then he built a new programming language called Swift, which after, let's say some adoption resistance became very successful."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "I don't know that much about his work at Google, although I know that that was a typical, they started TensorFlow stuff and it was new."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "They wrote a lot of code and then at some point it needed to be refactored to be, because its development slowed down, why PyTorch started a little later and then passed it."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So he did a lot of work on that."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "And then his idea about MLIR, which is what people started to realize is the complexity of the software stack above the low level IR was getting so high that forcing the features of that into the level was putting too much of a burden on it."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "So he's splitting that into multiple pieces."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "And that was one of the inspirations for our software stack where we have several intermediate representations that are all executable and you can look at them and do transformations on them before you lower the level."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "So that was, I think we started before MLIR really got far enough along to use, but we're interested in that."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "He's really excited about MLIR."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "That's his like little baby."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "So he, and there seems to be some profound ideas on that that are really useful."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "So each one of those things has been, as the world of software gets more and more complicated, how do we create the right abstraction levels to simplify it in a way that people can now work independently on different levels of it?"}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So I would say all three of those projects, LLVM, Swift, and MLIR did that successfully."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "So I'm interested in what he's gonna do next in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "On either the TPU or maybe the Nvidia GPU side, how does 10th Story think, or the ideas underlying it, does it have to be 10th Story?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "Just this kind of graph focused, graph centric hardware, deep learning centric hardware, beat NVIDIAs, do you think it's possible for it to basically overtake NVIDIA?"}, {"time": 4143, "text": "What's that process look like?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "What's that journey look like, you think?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "Well, GPUs were built to run shader programs on millions of pixels, not to run graphs."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "So there's a hypothesis that says the way the graphs are built is going to be really interesting to be inefficient on computing this."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And then the primitives is not a SIMD program, it's matrix multiply convolution."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then the data manipulations are fairly extensive about, like, how do you do a fast transpose with a program?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "I don't know if you've ever written a transpose program."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "They're ugly and slow, but in hardware, you can do really well."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Like, I'll give you an example."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So when GPU accelerators first started doing triangles, like, so you have a triangle which maps on a set of pixels."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "So you build, it's very easy, straightforward to build a hardware engine that'll find all those pixels."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And it's kind of weird because you walk along the triangle to get to the edge, and then you have to go back down to the next row and walk along, and then you have to decide on the edge if the line of the triangle is like half on the pixel, what's the pixel color?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Because it's half of this pixel and half the next one."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "That's called rasterization."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And you're saying that could be done in hardware?"}, {"time": 4215, "text": "No, that's an example of that operation as a software program is really bad."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "I've written a program that did rasterization."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "The hardware that does it has actually less code than the software program that does it, and it's way faster."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "Right, so there are certain times when the abstraction you have, rasterize a triangle, you know, execute a graph, you know, components of a graph."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "But the right thing to do in the hardware software boundary is for the hardware to naturally do it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And so the GPU is really optimized for the rasterization of triangles."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Well, you know, that's just, well, like in a modern, you know, that's a small piece of modern GPUs."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "What they did is that they still rasterize triangles when you're running in a game, but for the most part, most of the computation in the area of the GPU is running shader programs."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "But they're single threaded programs on pixels, not graphs."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "I have to be honest, I'd say I don't actually know the math behind shader, shading and lighting and all that kind of stuff."},

instructions in a shader program."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "But I don't have a good intuition why it could be parallelized so easily."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "No, it's because you have 8 million pixels in every single."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "So when you have a light, right, that comes down, the angle, you know, the amount of light, like say this is a line of pixels across this table, right?"}, {"time": 4300, "text": "The amount of light on each pixel is subtly different."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "And each pixel is responsible for figuring out what."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "Figuring it out."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "So that pixel says, I'm this pixel."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "I know the angle of the light."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I know the occlusion."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "I know the color I am."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Like every single pixel here is a different color."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Every single pixel gets a different amount of light."},

"text": "So you build a reflection map, which also has some pixelated thing."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And then when the pixel is looking at the reflection map, it has to calculate what the normal of the surface is."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And it does it per pixel."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "By the way, there's boatloads of hacks on that."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "You know, like you may have a lower resolution light map, your reflection map."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "There's all these, you know, tax they do."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's per pixel computation."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "And it's so happening that you can map graph like computation onto this pixel central computation."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "You can do floating point programs on convolutions and the matrices."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "And Nvidia invested for years in CUDA."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "First for HPC, and then they got lucky with the AI trend."}, {"time":

Yeah, it was a CV problem."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "And did classic CV and found stoplights and lines."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "And they were really good at it."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Yeah, and they never, I mean, I don't know what's happening now, but they never fully pivoted."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "I mean, it's like, it's the Nvidia thing."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "And then as opposed to, so if you look at the new Tesla work, it's like neural networks from the ground up, right?"}, {"time": 4545, "text": "Yeah, and even Tesla started with a lot of CV stuff in it and Andrei's basically been eliminating it."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "Move everything into the network."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So without, this isn't like confidential stuff, but you sitting on a porch, looking over the world, looking at the work that Andrei's doing, that Elon's doing with Tesla Autopilot, do you like the trajectory of where things are going on the hardware side?"}, {"time": 4569,

taking longer than anybody thought."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "You know, my wonder is, you know, hardware three, is it enough computing off by two, off by five, off by 10, off by a hundred?"}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And I thought it probably wasn't enough, but they're doing pretty well with it now."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And one thing is the data set gets bigger, the training gets better."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "And then there's this interesting thing is you sort of train and build an arbitrary size network that solves the problem."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "And then you refactor the network down to the thing that you can afford to ship, right?"}, {"time": 4626, "text": "So the goal isn't to build a network that fits in the phone."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "It's to build something that actually works."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "And then how do you make that most effective on the hardware you have?"}, {"time": 4639, "text": "And they seem to be doing that much better than a couple of years ago."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "Well, the one really important thing is also what they're doing well is how to iterate that quickly, which means like it's not just about one time deployment, one building, it's constantly iterating the network and trying to automate as many steps as possible, right?"}, {"time": 4657, "text": "And that's actually the principles of the Software 2.0, like you mentioned with Andre is it's not just, I mean, I don't know what the actual, his description of Software 2.0 is."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "If it's just high level philosophical or their specifics, but the interesting thing about what that actually looks in the real world is it's that what I think Andre calls the data engine, it's like it's the iterative improvement of the thing."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "You have a neural network that does stuff, fails on a bunch of things and learns from it over and over and over."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So you're constantly discovering edge cases."}, {"time": 4695, "text": "So it's very much about like data engineering, like figuring out, it's kind of what you were talking about with TestTorrent is you have the data landscape."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "And you have to walk along that data landscape in a way that is constantly improving the neural network."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And that feels like that's the central piece of it."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "And there's two pieces of it."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Like you find edge cases that don't work and then you define something that goes, get your data for that."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "But then the other constraint is whether you have to label it or not."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "Like the amazing thing about like the GPT3 stuff is it's unsupervised."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "So there's essentially infinite amount of data."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "Now there's obviously infinite amount of data available from cars of people successfully driving."}, {"time": 4739, "text": "But the current pipelines are mostly running on labeled data, which is human limited."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "So when that becomes unsupervised, it'll create unlimited amount of data, which then they'll scale."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Now the networks that may use that data might be way too big for cars, but then there'll be the transformation from now we have unlimited data, I know exactly what I want."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "Now can I turn that into something that fits in the car?"}, {"time": 4765, "text": "And that process is gonna happen all over the place."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Every time you get to the place where you have unlimited data, and that's what software 2.0 is about, unlimited data training networks to do stuff without humans writing code to do it."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "And ultimately also trying to discover, like you're saying, the self supervised formulation of the problem."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "So the unsupervised formulation of the problem."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Like in driving, there's this really interesting thing, which is you look at a scene that's before you, and you have data about what a successful human driver did in that scene one second later."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "It's a little piece of data that you can use just like with GPT3 as training."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "Currently, even though Tesla says they're using that, it's an open question to me, how far can you, can you solve all of the driving with just that self supervised piece of data?"}, {"time": 4820, "text": "And like, I think."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Well, that's what Common AI is doing."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "That's what Common AI is doing, but the question is how much data."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So what Common AI doesn't have is as good of a data engine, for example, as Tesla does."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "That's where the, like the organization of the data."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "I mean, as far as I know, I haven't talked to George, but they do have the data."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "The question is how much data is needed, because we say infinite very loosely here."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "And then the other question, which you said, I don't know if you think it's still an open question is, are we on the right order of magnitude for the compute necessary?"}, {"time": 4862, "text": "That is this, is it like what Elon said, this chip that's in there now is enough to do full self driving, or do we need another order of magnitude?"}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I think nobody actually knows the answer to that question."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "I like the confidence that Elon has, but."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "Yeah, we'll see."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "There's another funny thing is you don't learn to drive with infinite amounts of data."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "You learn to drive with an intellectual framework that understands physics and color and horizontal surfaces and laws and roads and all your experience from manipulating your environment."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Like, look, there's so many factors go into that."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "So then when you learn to drive, like driving is a subset of this conceptual framework that you have, right?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "And so with self driving cars right now, we're teaching them to drive with driving data."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "You never teach a human to do that."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "You teach a human all kinds of interesting things, like language, like don't do that, watch out."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "There's all kinds of stuff going on."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "Well, this is where you, I think previous time we talked about where you poetically disagreed with my naive notion about humans."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "I just think that humans will make this whole driving thing really difficult."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Yeah, all right."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "I said, humans don't move that slow."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "It's a ballistics problem."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "It's a ballistics, humans are a ballistics problem, which is like poetry to me."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "It's very possible that in driving they're indeed purely a ballistics problem."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And I think that's probably the right way to think about it."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "But I still, they still continue to surprise me, those damn pedestrians, the cyclists, other humans in other cars and."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "Yeah, but it's gonna be one of these compensating things."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So like when you're driving, you have an intuition about what humans are going to do, but you don't have 360 cameras and radars and you have an attention problem."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "So the self driving car comes in with no attention problem, 360 cameras right now, a bunch of other features."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So they'll wipe out a whole class of accidents, right?"}, {"time": 4981, "text": "And emergency braking with radar and especially as it gets AI enhanced will eliminate collisions, right?"}, {"time": 4990, "text": "But then you have the other problems of these unexpected things where you think your human intuition is helping, but then the cars also have a set of hardware features that you're not even close to."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "And the key thing of course is if you wipe out a huge number of kind of accidents, then it might be just way safer than a human driver, even though, even if humans are still a problem, that's hard to figure out."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "Yeah, that's probably what will happen."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Those autonomous cars will have a small number of accidents humans would have avoided, but they'll wipe, they'll get rid of the bulk of them."}, {"time": 5023, "text": "What do you think about like Tesla's dojo efforts or it can be bigger than Tesla in general."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "It's kind of like the tense torrent trying to innovate, like this is the dichotomy, like should a company try to from scratch build its own neural network training hardware?"}, {"time": 5043, "text": "Well, first of all, I think it's great."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "So we need lots of experiments, right?"}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And there's lots of startups working on this and they're pursuing different things."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "I was there when we started dojo and it was sort of like, what's the unconstrained computer solution to go do very large training problems?"}, {"time": 5061, "text": "And then there's fun stuff like, we said, well, we have this 10,000 watt board to cool."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "Well, you go talk to guys at SpaceX and they think 10,000 watts is a really small number, not a big number."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "And there's brilliant people working on it."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "I'm curious to see how it'll come out."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "I couldn't tell you, I know it pivoted a few times since I left, so."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "So the cooling does seem to be a big problem."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "I do like what Elon said about it, which is like, we don't wanna do the thing unless it's way better than the alternative, whatever the alternative is."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "So it has to be way better than like racks or GPUs."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "Yeah, and the other thing is just like, you know, the Tesla autonomous driving hardware, it was only serving one software stack."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "And the hardware team and the software team were tightly coupled."}, {"time": 5109, "text": "You know, if you're building a general purpose AI solution, then you know, there's so many different customers with so many different needs."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "Now, something Andre said is, I think this is amazing."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "10 years ago, like vision, recommendation, language, were completely different disciplines."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "He said, the people literally couldn't talk to each other."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "And three years ago, it was all neural networks, but the very different neural networks."}, {"time": 5134, "text": "And recently, it's converging on one set of networks."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "They vary a lot in size, obviously, they vary in data, vary in outputs, but the technology has converged a good bit."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "Yeah, these transformers behind GPT3, it seems like they could be applied to video, they could be applied to a lot of, and it's like, and they're all really simple."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "And it was like they literally replace letters with pixels."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "It does vision, it's amazing."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "And then size actually improves the thing."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "So the bigger it gets, the more compute you throw at it, the better it gets."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "And the more data you have, the better it gets."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "So then you start to wonder, well, is that a fundamental thing?"}, {"time": 5172, "text": "Or is this just another step to some fundamental understanding about this kind of computation?"}, {"time": 5178,

understand everything you're saying to really enjoy it."}, {"time": 8460, "text": "So that's the magic of podcasting is like, you can go through like 10 minutes and not understanding what the hell a person is saying, and then you enjoy the excitement and then you reconnect to a thing that you do understand what they're saying."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "And, you know, that's, that personal

think is an excellent conversationalist, you just lose track of time."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "It can be three, four, five hours and you lose track of time."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "I'm still not there."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "I find that it's still painful."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "You don't lose quite as

cliche thing, that change is the only constant in these times because you're paving with this podcast, with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram as well, you're paving the new era of what it means to do science."}, {"time": 8857, "text": "So actively doing research and actively explaining that research in new media."}, {"time": 8862, "text": "It's very interesting to see."}, {"time": 8864, "text": "I'm genuinely inspired by you."}, {"time": 8867, "text": "We had this discussion last time after the podcast recording, and it's clear that communication of science cannot be left to the existing institutions."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "And I'm not talking about universities."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "I just mean that the science section of newspapers is, sometimes there's some gems there, but generally it goes, you know?"}, {"time": 8888, "text": "And I think you really have to know a field in order to extract the best things from that field."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "And my hope is that other practicing scientists and people finishing their PhD and postdoc and people who are running labs or working at companies will start to do this."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance, if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints about not necessarily what they're developing because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons, but would talk to us about what the real challenges of building futuristic brain machine interface are like and what it means to understand a clinical problem and address it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that, that somebody in the world of chemistry or synthetic materials or whatever it is will do this in a way that I could understand because I don't have expertise in those."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "I think it would be marvelous."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "And you were tip of the spear, you were out first, and I'm just happily trying to move along in the direction I'm going."}, {"time": 8950, "text": "But I think the future of science education is online."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And I think that's gonna be scary to a lot of existing institutions, but it's not about disrupting anything."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "It's just about trying to do things better."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "Yeah, some of the best interviews, some of the best investigative journalism is done by people inside the field."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk, who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer for that interview."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "But he grilled the crap out of Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar."}, {"time": 8987, "text": "Oh, on Clubhouse the other night."}, {"time": 8990, "text": "Yeah, I saw you guys in there."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "My thumbs don't go fast enough."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "So I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room."}, {"time": 8997, "text": "Have you tried that social network, by the way, the Clubhouse?"}, {"time": 8999, "text": "I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "I'm there, I have a few questions about it that like if I'm in there, how one can participate or not participate."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations."}, {"time": 9013, "text": "I've been very curious as to what's going on in there."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts."}, {"time": 9018, "text": "Maybe it's useful to comment."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "I also have a Discord server that has a few tens of thousands of people on it."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And then they have also a voice chat capability."}, {"time": 9031, "text": "So there's these get togethers."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "And I was using it in the spring and summer, like actively on those voice discussions."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "And it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people all together in voice."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Like anyone can speak anytime, right?"}, {"time": 9049, "text": "But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet."}, {"time": 9052, "text": "Only one person speaks at a time because they're all like respectful."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "And it's a community of like fundamentally respectful people, even though they're all anonymous."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So like, except like me and a few others, it's all anonymous people."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "It's so interesting and it works."}, {"time": 9068, "text": "But the magical thing to me about that community was how intimate voice only communication can be."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "It felt as intimate as like a small get together at a home with close friends."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "It felt like there's a calmness to it."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "And you're revealing things about, you know, somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So those are the dark things or being super excited, getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend."}, {"time": 9102, "text": "Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice without video is, I was really surprised how intimate that is for human connection, especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "So just to give you some context, there's something there."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "There's definitely something there."}, {"time": 9120, "text": "One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse, you have your little icon."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "So they don't actually, you don't see your face moving."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I think when people see their own image, it puts them in a state of self consciousness that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "So like Zoom is dreadful because if I'm not used to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself staring back at me in the mirror."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "And it's just, I know there are ways that you can adjust that, but it's really awful."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And I think that when I get on Zooms now, I say hello and then I shut down the video component."}, {"time": 9154, "text": "And then I just talk in the end."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "But I think that voice only is really interesting."}, {"time": 9162, "text": "Eddie Chang would be an interesting person to talk to about this because he understands so much about how inflection communicates emotionality in deeper state."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "But there's a balance between, I think, just like you said, this is the privacy somehow allows for the intimacy."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act, which I realize we do when we're visually presenting ourselves in remote communication."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "But I think that there's so few places where people can actually communicate without the fear of penalty."}, {"time": 9195, "text": "That's woefully absent these days."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place where they feel like I can say what I want or not say anything and it's okay."}, {"time": 9206, "text": "And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is, there was a big improvement to me over Discord, which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people, the person that created the room can invite people up that would like to speak potentially, have the opportunity to speak."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "And then there's a bigger audience that don't get a chance to speak unless they click raise their hand and they get called on."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "So there's like a tier system that allows for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people talking and a lot larger amount in the audience, which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk."}, {"time": 9246, "text": "And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody is strongly encouraged to represent themselves."}, {"time": 9251, "text": "So you're using your real name, it's not anonymous."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And how many people were in that GameStop discussion the other day?"}, {"time": 9258, "text": "They currently limit rooms to 5,000."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "There's a lot of overflow rooms."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "This is the cool thing about Clubhouse, really big people were on there all tuned in and having a conversation, having all from, all these different worlds being able to connect, even though without the niceties of like arranging the meeting, you could just show up and leave, which is really nice."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "But the reason for my lessons from Discord, I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse."}, {"time": 9296, "text": "Or go in there under another name."}, {"time": 9300, "text": "I'll pretend I know the actual, your actual name."}, {"time": 9302, "text": "Yeah, it's, I've learned, it's quite addicting."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "It's a time sink."}, {"time": 9308, "text": "It's so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself wasting quite a bit of time on there."}, {"time": 9314, "text": "It pulls you in."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "They would in sort of going back to the podcast or earlier, we're talking about books or creating a technology."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "One thing that's absolutely clear is that anything that's easy to reproduce is probably not worth much effort and time."}, {"time": 9335, "text": "I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced."}, {"time": 9339, "text": "You just repost them."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "So now there are some original posts that for which the attribution goes to the original person and it's clear it came from you."}, {"time": 9348, "text": "But anything that can be easily reproduced is, doesn't really expand us very much as individuals or as groups."}, {"time": 9355, "text": "And most of what I see on social media is stuff that is purely reproduced."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be that some real magic emerges on there."}, {"time": 9368, "text": "So in moderation could be good."}, {"time": 9370, "text": "The magic is, this is another thing that I've found through COVID that maybe you can think about is live."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events."}, {"time": 9388, "text": "Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part, it's not supposed to be recorded."}, {"time": 9394, "text": "Most people don't record most conversations."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "It's a one time live event."}, {"time": 9398, "text": "And there's a magic to that."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "That's not captured by like your podcast or my podcast produced video that's like recorded, like packaged up."}, {"time": 9410, "text": "Well, anything can happen."}, {"time": 9412, "text": "It's that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "And that's the kind of thing like live concerts."}, {"time": 9417, "text": "I definitely, I love live music."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "And it's the idea that, cause you can always listen to the album."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better, but it's just this idea that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know, you like a Costello did something weird."}, {"time": 9433, "text": "Your dog did something weird."}, {"time": 9435, "text": "And then you have to go, God damn it."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something."}, {"time": 9439, "text": "And then you come back and it's funny."}, {"time": 9442, "text": "I watched live video like that of people and I'll be there for the whole time."}, {"time": 9446, "text": "I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "It's not like I tune out."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "Well, it humanizes it."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "Yeah, humanizes it."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not it's a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end of those tunnels and shouting some things back."}, {"time": 9469, "text": "You know, that's kind of the format we're in."}, {"time": 9472, "text": "I think I'll check out Clubhouse again."}, {"time": 9474, "text": "I've gone in there a few times during the day and I was surprised to see how many people were in there in the middle of the day."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "I was like, aren't these people supposed to be working?"}, {"time": 9481, "text": "But maybe that is their work."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "Well, be very careful about the time sink of it."}, {"time": 9487, "text": "But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together, we'll have a conversation on there."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "But one of the things you have to figure out, I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit."}, {"time": 9497, "text": "Which is like."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "And you just do the, isn't there the leave quietly button?"}, {"time": 9500, "text": "Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "But like you really, if it's just you and I, then it's the usual human communication of like, all right, I gotta go."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "Like, but when it's like four people, you don't want to interrupt everyone and announce you're leaving."}, {"time": 9521, "text": "You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic that I haven't quite figured out of."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "The etiquette isn't clear."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "The etiquette is not clear."}, {"time": 9528, "text": "Well, the etiquette on different platforms and how that changes is really interesting."}, {"time": 9534, "text": "You know, how YouTube has one etiquette, which is kind of, it's a lot of harshness is tolerated on YouTube video comments."}, {"time": 9541, "text": "Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram."}, {"time": 9544, "text": "Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "People are nice."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "People are really nice."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "People are really nice on Instagram for the most part, except for those phishing things."}, {"time": 9553, "text": "I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account poached by those copyright."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "They come in with those like, you violated copyright thing."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "There's all sorts of harshness in there that if you think about it in the real world, I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "Someone comes over and is basically saying like, hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank and I'll get some money out for you?"}, {"time": 9573, "text": "And like, but there's this trust based on the format it comes in that it can almost get past your radar unless you're suspicious."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "If you took comments, like, you know, you're posting a lot of comments and you said, you just walk past 500 random people on the street and just listen to what they say, it's like, that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 9592, "text": "I don't have time for that."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "But the comments somehow take on this importance and this relevance."}, {"time": 9596, "text": "And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?"}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And so the online communities, the rules really are different."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And they evolve with time, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "With Clubhouse, it's a new social network, so it's evolving and people are figuring it out as you go."}, {"time": 9613, "text": "And the same thing with podcasting on video and like scientific podcasting."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created, I'm learning, I'm thinking like, hmm, that's interesting to do it this way."}, {"time": 9626, "text": "Because like, I have nobody to copy."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 9631, "text": "Well, you threw out an idea."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "I'm not gonna put it out here now, cause I don't wanna, cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it no matter what."}, {"time": 9638, "text": "But when we talked about this issue of the challenge of staying on a particular topic for a while, I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "Oh, no, no, no."}, {"time": 9647, "text": "That's separate from this format."}, {"time": 9648, "text": "And I love your interview format, but when you told me about that, I got really excited that you might go forward."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is, but I will say this, it is super cool."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "I would have never thought about it."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "It's distinctly different than what I'm doing or what Lex is currently doing."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "And if you decide to do that podcast, I will be your first and your number one fan."}, {"time": 9669, "text": "And I know there are gonna be millions of other people interested in that."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "It would be amazing."}, {"time": 9673, "text": "So if you decide to go forward with the idea, that would be awesome."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "I was gonna say what it is, but now I'm not going to because, cause that's even more interesting."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon, because I just wanted to get your thoughts about something he's said a few times to me and in general, is that he's under a huge amount of stress."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "And I'm thinking of doing a startup now and kind of thinking about all of this."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science, but he says that his life is basically hell."}, {"time": 9717, "text": "He looks happy, but he's probably very good at."}, {"time": 9719, "text": "He's fulfilled."}, {"time": 9721, "text": "He's fulfilled, but the stress levels, the constant fires that he has to put out."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "And he says that most people wouldn't want to be me."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And that basically the reason he does what he does is because there's probably something wrong with him."}, {"time": 9739, "text": "Like it's not, he can't help it, but do that."}, {"time": 9744, "text": "Kind of beautiful in a kind of Russian masochistic way."}, {"time": 9749, "text": "Well, I just wonder the stress."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I mean, I'm sure you can imagine the kind of stress he's under because, so it's running three plus companies and there's constant, he says that every single meeting is not about like, should we install a coffee maker in the kitchen?"}, {"time": 9771, "text": "It's like, this rocket is going to blow up and we're all fucked."}, {"time": 9779, "text": "And we have to, you have to fix, you have to fix real like big problems there."}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And like, how do you deal with that?"}, {"time": 9787, "text": "What do you think about that kind of life?"}, {"time": 9789, "text": "One, is there a way to walk through that fire?"}, {"time": 9793, "text": "And two, should you walk through that fire?"}, {"time": 9798, "text": "Well, I mean, without knowing I've never met Elon, but certainly we have common friends in you and in other people that he worked with long ago in the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him and show, express immense admiration for the number of things that he can maintain."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade."}, {"time": 9828, "text": "It's clear."}, {"time": 9829, "text": "And that what he does would dissolve most people into a puddle of tears."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "Mostly because of this whole thing about the brain working hard equates to thinking about duration path and outcome and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D, a lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction."}, {"time": 9849, "text": "And that is hard, it's stressful."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "It requires intense neurochemical output."}, {"time": 9854, "text": "And he's doing that for multiple projects."}, {"time": 9856, "text": "So presumably he's buffered himself from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues, but he is himself, unless there's something I don't know, he's walking around in a biological system."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "Yes, allegedly, yes."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "So, and I don't wanna reveal too much here, but I have a common coworker and colleague through some contract work I do that what I can tell you is that he's accessing the best resources in terms of how to optimize his biology."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "And he's thinking about that, not just for himself, but for all of Neuralink."}, {"time": 9893, "text": "Because I think, I'm not trying to dodge the question, but I think there's the scale of the individual, but then there's the companies that he's creating."}, {"time": 9902, "text": "And you've got people there that you could imagine if they're working at 10% better capacity or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day, you're looking at a enormous increase in productivity and a reduction in the time to reach goals, which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon, unless he goes and starts another endeavor."}, {"time": 9923, "text": "So I think it's certainly not healthy for most people."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits."}, {"time": 9931, "text": "I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family and he's got kids growing up and a relationship and all that, so it's super impressive."}, {"time": 9940, "text": "I think that, I don't know, how old is Elon?"}, {"time": 9944, "text": "He's 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48."}, {"time": 9949, "text": "Even more impressive."}, {"time": 9951, "text": "Because many people who've been at exceedingly high output for a decade or more don't do well."}, {"time": 9958, "text": "Their system breaks down."}, {"time": 9960, "text": "Well, this is what he was saying."}, {"time": 9998, "text": "Like, it's like puzzles, it's constant puzzle solving."}, {"time": 10001, "text": "I would be concerned about taking somebody who's in that regime and suddenly putting them into a regime where they don't have enough to bite down into."},

well and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling."}, {"time": 10020, "text": "And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is by way of his natural leanings."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "Unless there's a backstory that's trauma based or something, and I don't even begin to think that there is, it seems that he has, he's one of those rare individuals in history that has an immense drive to create in all these different domains."}, {"time": 10042, "text": "I'm just saying the obvious here, but it seems like that's what makes him tick."}, {"time": 10047, "text": "I mean, you're doing an awful lot too."}, {"time": 10049, "text": "Well, the problem is not really, the problem is I've been on the verge of pulling the trigger on starting a company, which will increase the workload significantly."}, {"time": 10063, "text": "And I'm attracted to that because of a dream I have, but it's a little bit scary because it can destroy you in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 10076, "text": "There's two sources of destruction."}, {"time": 10079, "text": "So one source is, I've, for the first time in my life, a few months ago, I think, have gotten, this feels like such a noob thing to say it, but I've gotten some hate on the internet."}, {"time": 10097, "text": "I know, right?"}, {"time": 10099, "text": "But like, I am such an idiot."}, {"time": 10100, "text": "I'm so naive to, it was, I had the question that I guess a lot of people have when they get hate on the internet."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "It's like, mom, why are these people making up stuff about me?"}, {"time": 10115, "text": "That kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that?"}, {"time": 10119, "text": "And the reason I mentioned that is like, well, if you wanna go and start a business and do, as I think

you."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It's like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up with a hammer and smokes you in the melon and then disappears into the ether again."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking, how can I attack without being hit?"}, {"time": 1662, "text": "So every strategy, every idea you have about what you're going to do has to do with like that minimizing the returns."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I mean, that's what all good fighting is done."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "All poor fighting, you know, throughout the course of history, most generals, whether they're, so I read, or, you know, they did battles by attrition."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "You've got 50."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "You're like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50, like, that's great for me."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "But that's not so great for the 60 guys that died."},

this through and there's like, hey, there's no way we can like, you know, walk around the side, huh?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Because oftentimes there is, and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives in professional fighting too, for people to want to do that."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And we come up with all sorts of, well, I'm trying to be exciting."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Is that

was winning with seconds remaining, literally seconds remaining."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And they probably could have just let it go and he would have been world champion."}, {"time": 1751, "text":

heartbreaking."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight changed him for the rest of his life."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before, but it was one of those where you go, it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name at age 44 years old."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "And I didn't come here, what did

that that's kind of what we're shooting for."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage and that not being a big deal, like you hear that all the time."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So and so can take shots that would put a lesser fighter down."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "You know, like, so let me get this straight."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Your ability to absorb damage is a part of you."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "I mean, I guess that, don't get me wrong, that is an attribute that's nice to have if you need it."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "But there's plenty of people that actually have really porous defense that are just very, very difficult to hurt for whatever reason."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I mean, the story that is inspiring and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting is when you have taken the damage to still rise up and be able to defeat the opponent."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "So it's, but that's a flip side of a basically you failing to defend yourself properly, right?"}, {"time": 1839, "text": "But let's say for, I think it's a triumph, that's a triumph of humanity."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "That's a triumph, that's amazing."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "To witness such a thing is unbelievable."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "But you still go, this is, there is a cost here."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "It's like, I've been fortunate enough to spend some time working with the military and I've been like around and read Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Like you read the story and you're like, it'll floor you."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "But it's still a cost and you don't wanna be paying that cost a long time."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "And most of the time the cost was everything."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah, the value here, it's worth everything."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's like, I defend your family, defend your country under certain circumstances."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And if that point is extension of your family,

{"time": 1882, "text": "And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see, but."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "But it's also amazing to see you not take damage as the Floyd Mayweather, it's the artistry of like not being hit."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "And I wonder if maybe that's why people don't resonate with Floyd as much, is obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place, a great man for so many different reasons."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Although it was funny to remember like there were times when he wasn't very popular."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "We love him now because of time of context, time to move away from some of the nonsense he had to deal with."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "But we got to see him struggle."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And also he had unbelievable sacrifice, both in and out of the ring, that we all got to witness."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And granted, obviously Floyd isn't like a civil rights figure like Muhammad Ali was, it's different time, different place, and he's a different man."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "But basically, I wonder if part of the thing that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest, in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things that he did out in the world and the stands that he made, we saw him struggle in the ring."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It's almost, it's humanizing."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "You know, it's weird when people respect Khabib, but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "Khabib is amazing."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "But I wonder how people feel about him longterm."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Not like they won't think of him as amazing and great."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "And he's been a respectable person and champion."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "But the time, he hasn't had to fall, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic about sort of the way he was in the ring, sort of being able to explain the artistry that he, I mean, there's like joking as being playful, but really he was able to describe the flow, like a butterfly sting like a bee."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy without talking, without crossing that line into the Floyd Mayweather, when you're just talking about money and just talking shit."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Actually Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit, it's pretty good at like talking about the art of the martial, like the first mug guy."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And I wish Khabib did the same."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Actually from like the Setia brothers, there's a few, there's a culture of like being poetic about like being scholars and also bards or whatever, the poets of the game."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And Khabib was more like just simple and he lets his actions speak, which is great too."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "It's a cool thing in its own way."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But it's nice when you can tell stories and that's probably why Ali was the great."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "Catch me up to, you went to three fights, I think undefeated, BJ Penn, we talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "That's an incredible accomplishment, but you fought a lot of really tough guys."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "When was your last fight?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And then catch me up with the injuries."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "A lot of people kept more and more and more were unwilling to fight you."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "Yeah, that's been, that was why I was out for two years following the Gray Maynard fight between the fighting Gray and BJ and the Gray Maynard fight was actually one I'm really proud of because Gray was very tough."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "He's very big, very strong, very experienced."}, {"time": 2073, "text":

what I had in December, 2016."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And that, it really took a lot of discipline, a lot of focus, a lot of challenge, to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight and to win in ultimately dominating fashion, just not in the dominating, obvious sense that you see when someone runs across and just does that to somebody, but that wasn't on the list for me at that time."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "So that was an interesting one, but the time away again was very frustrating."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "That was incredibly difficult."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "Before that fight?"}, {"time": 2108, "text": "After that fight, well, because I beat Artem Lobov in the final of the Ultimate Fighter and Artem is another guy that's tough, a lot of experience and he's a funny guy and he said some things on the internet, so he gets a lot of heat for that."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "But he just knocked out three of my teammates."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "I'm like, he put a couple of people in a pretty rough shape at the end of that."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So he was doing well and that was a tough fight."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now, it would be not competitive at all."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time, but it was a compelling phase."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It wasn't close, but it was competitive."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So you were improving and growing fast."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Yeah, and it was nice to have time away."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "I wish I'd had more time in the ring, but again, I'd only been doing MMA for three years at that time."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "So the improvement from doing what, the Bitcoin mining was overriding

really important thing to understand because at various points in my martial arts career, I've thought, oh man, how should I feel?"}, {"time": 2207, "text": "I remember when I used to do well in competition, I would feel, I would think these thoughts, listen to this song, think about this."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "I would feel a certain way."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "And then if you don't

me navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "And I think about that for, let's say, fighting, it's a good example, like confidence, plenty of people believe plenty of things that aren't real, myself included, I'm sure, all the time."}, {"time": 2832, "text": "And anyway, believing that you can do something, I'm like, hey, I think I can win, doesn't guarantee you

individual centric, so believing that free will is real puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people when they do something bad."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion, we start to think about the system of humans together as this mechanism for progress, as opposed to where individual people are responsible for their actions, good or bad."},

people live in the world that they wanna believe in."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Well, if free will doesn't exist, and it's just about how things move forward, when are we gonna be high fiving this guy

up, or I brought up, there's literally a giant book about Hitler."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II, and Stalin recently."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "For

positive?"}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Like cat in the hat or something, I don't know."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But you brought up Hitler as an example of something particular, some philosophical discussions we're having."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And the excellent, eloquent, and the full of integrity MMA journalist clipped out something you've said about Hitler and said that, I forget what the headlines are, but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "Basically, it was intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying."}, {"time": 3073, "text":

funny is that, hey, we gotta be careful what we believe."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And again, back to the cancel culture thing that we discussed last time as well, where would I like to apologize?"},

apologize for because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Now, you could say that I'm not a historical scholar, which I would agree immediately."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And also that I oftentimes in eloquently or inarticulately phrase things, which I'll agree is again."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "But ultimately, going, hey, I wanna make you believe, live in the world that you're suggesting ought to exist."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Okay, so if there's no free will, how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically before we start going, hey, this is good because we're experiencing a social reckoning in our country at the moment, for good and for other probably, I guess."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?"}, {"time": 3147, "text": "So that's probably not something that would fly."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "And I think that's a fair thing."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "It might not fly from the individual perspective, but if you zoom out and think, appreciate society as just like an ant colony as a beautifully complex system, like we kinda, from the individual perspective, we value progress, especially progress of the individual, but in whole progress of societies."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "But if you accept that this is just a complex system that's not necessarily headed anywhere, that this is almost like that river is just flowing, I think that removes the burden of always striving, of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "So it's possible that if we have no control, you can like arrive at some kind of other zen state."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "Does that sound very human though?"}, {"time": 3198, "text": "That goes against, I think,

lives matter and so on."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "Maybe if we convince ourselves that we're just sort of like little things in a stream and ultimately none of it matters, there might be some kind of

me."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "And I guess that comes back to even Sam's point about, oh, we want to, trying to spread the idea that free will doesn't exist."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "I'm not saying

the big deal?"}, {"time": 3708, "text": "Yeah, so the libertarian viewpoint, which I probably espouse, like that's, I'm very much like freedom of the individual is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone unless they're trying to hurt you."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "The thing is you also have to, I believe, put in the work of empathy of understanding what others, how, what leaving people

all trained with people that make us think about beating the ever loving crap."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "I never wanted to be that guy."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "And I was basically saying like, if

about it."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And then they don't have to tell me, they're under no obligation, but I'll say, and whether they tell me or don't tell me, thank you so much for your time, I

which is difficult, I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit, is don't trust authority, essentially."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "Keep asking why."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "Be respectful without trusting authority, right?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Right, which is, and then the second thing is be the kind of person that others like training with or like being around, sort of being a good friend."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "So so many people just enjoy being around."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So one is completely, which is, yeah, you're right, it's attention, which is like completely disrespect the way that things are done."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So asking why constantly."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "One of it is your own flaws and not understanding the fundamentals of what's being described."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "And then once you get good enough, not understanding, like going against the fact that the instructor doesn't understand."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "And my

5587, "text": "I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "But so everyone's a little bit different."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular in high school."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "You know, like, I didn't like high school very much."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "But anyway, I would, not gonna be rude to people, though."}, {"time":

the person who is probably the closest thing to a font of knowledge at that time for me."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "So, and then recognizing that I should do that for its own virtue because it's the right thing to do and I should try to treat people decently."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "But beyond that, even selfishly, it's in my interest to do that."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But see, the thing is, this is interesting, is there's a culture in martial arts, a culture that I like where the instructor, legitimately so, carries an aura of authority."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "And it's not comfortable to really ask why."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "I'm not, it's a skill to be able to have a discussion as a white belt or the black belt instructor of like, why is it done this way?"},

because like, it's the drilling thing."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And, you know, I, for example, like in my, when I was coming out, there was so much emphasis placed on like, close guard, for example."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "And you might actually teach me now, I don't know, but to me it was like, why do I need to master the close guard?"}, {"time": 5712, "text": "Like, why is the close

know when it came out recently, right?"}, {"time": 6726, "text": "Like December or something like that?"}, {"time": 6727, "text": "Yeah, it's part one."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "It was actually like ended up being like 18 hours long and I was like, oh my God, we gotta chop it in half."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "And when it comes together, the whole thing, I think I hope people will like it."}, {"time": 6737, "text": "Yeah, well it's even part one is really good."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "Yeah, people on Reddit were really excited for part two as well."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "And you also have a back."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "Oh, the old one."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "The old one that I, that was really helpful to me to understand some very basic aspects of control for the back."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "There's very few instructionals."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "There's very few things I've watched that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "It taught me one thing, I don't know, it's you drop a lot of sort of bombs, you drop a lot of really interesting details and it's funny that there's only specific things that really click."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in and it's like, oh, that's interesting, okay, yeah, but there's certain things that really click."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "And I remember when that first instruction will click with me is like the importance."}, {"time": 6794, "text": "I don't remember any more like how you communicated it because I've now integrated, it's now mine, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 6801, "text": "But it was more about you just describing upper body control and the importance of the upper body control from the back."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "And just like the, there's certain grip, like you did describe different details on the grips and so on and as I started trying it, I realized how important upper body control is versus like me maybe as a blue belt or something was I thought like you have achieved victory when you got the two hooks in."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "And then I realized like at least for me that the hooks were not even for my body type, for my style, for the way I approach things, they were not even important at all."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "It's supplemental for the most part, yeah."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "So they were there for the points but I can establish a huge amount of control."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about like illusion of choice, it almost made people panic a lot more when you were like fighting for it or establishing that kind of control."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren't involved even though they should be a lot more panicked."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things, especially that had to do with judo because so much of judo on the ground is centered around aggressive, efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds of clock chokes and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start to make its way into jiu jitsu coming up but like the judo style approach to like clock choking, triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff, so powerful."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "Yeah, and there's something about judo that emphasizes obviously due to the rules, the urgency."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "So you only do techniques that go fast."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And then the other thing is, which I guess jiu jitsu emphasizes too but judo really does, which is the transition."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So like while the person's flying in the air is the easiest time."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit, which is like, why not put in your submissions or positional control while they're in the air?"}, {"time": 6923, "text": "If you could, why would you not, right?"}, {"time": 6926, "text": "It's like, oh, well, I don't throw well."}, {"time": 6927, "text": "We'll learn how to throw and then do it."}, {"time": 6929, "text": "And so you should think, I mean, in the transition, when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff."}, {"time": 6935, "text": "And that's when you think about chokes, as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke and then everything becomes a lot easier."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "You ever see Flabio Canto?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "Man, Brazilian judoka is just so cool."}, {"time": 6948, "text": "Like with stuff like that."}, {"time": 6949, "text": "Yeah, exactly, but that has to do with the first starting principle of like, stop thinking this as a two phase game of standing and then ground."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Start thinking about like the standing and the, the standing comes before and the ground comes after, but everything happens in a transition."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war?"}, {"time": 6969, "text":

6976, "text": "But, I mean like, I'm serious, but how many people quote stuff and then like, it's like the, what is it, the family guy joke where they're like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in, he's like, you're not listening to my work, what are you talking about?"}, {"time": 6987, "text": "And anyway, basically, like the art of war, one of the things that's like the only thing that you can be sure of being successful in attacking is something that's undefended."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "We're like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "But you know, in a fight though, they're defended."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "Well, are they?"}, {"time": 7004, "text": "There's moments all the time where I'm borderline defenseless."}, {"time": 7007, "text": "And if you were to

that's the trick of almost all like conflict, right?"}, {"time": 7025, "text": "It's like showing up when the other person's taking a nap."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And then it's so funny, like we take like a protracted war."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "It's like, oh, it takes five years."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "And there's lulls and there's a battle this month, but then there's a couple of

taking place in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "And there's moments of lulls of person effectively going for a snack, being like in a horror movie, like, hey guys,

examples."}, {"time": 7111, "text": "Like first off, I saw someone finishing a 50, 50 heel hook in the UFC one promo."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "It was like some chubby dude in karate, like inside

7140, "text": "In fact, it works so well."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And it was so, it was then the people who used it were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one."}, {"time": 7148, "text":

what is the guard?"}, {"time": 7227, "text": "A guard's a defensive idea where you're kind of on your back to some extent or another, and you're using your legs as a wall between you and the other

well."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "So it's a one arm over, one arm under, and there's a certain side you're supposed to be on when you're on the back."}, {"time": 7373, "text": "Everyone teaches,

the innovation that I see is not innovation."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "It's like basically changing the color of a car or polishing like the window a little bit, where you're like, hey, you made it,

issue, like, yeah."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "I feel like everything else is already an issue."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "It's already an issue, yeah."}, {"time": 9331, "text": "Because the tie to me,

invent a few interesting ways to use it as leverage, as control and so on, but there's just so many more things around the gi belt that are better."}, {"time": 9386, "text": "And so for me, the tie, what people don't realize."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "Are we trying to sell a DVD here and have some widgets and bells and whistles?"}, {"time": 9392, "text": "Because in that case, the belt is really

what happens."}, {"time": 9457, "text": "No, like to the death, what is their clothing that's useful, you know?"}, {"time": 9463, "text": "From my perspective."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "You mean like for your use or their use?"}, {"time": 9466, "text": "Both, my use, their use."}, {"time": 9468, "text": "No, like I like how you wanted to take the belt off and use the buckle to hit them with."},

was figuring was when they started to see me take my pants off in the fight, they were like, what?"}, {"time": 9484, "text": "They're gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?"}, {"time": 9488, "text": "And I'm making dead eye contact, obviously, this is going on."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "Yeah, exactly, nodding."}, {"time": 9492, "text": "And then, you know, by the time they realized you took a belt off until you could whip them with it, you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "Okay, so fine, let's not talk about your own clothing, let's talk about their clothing."}, {"time": 9502, "text": "Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit them with it."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "No, but that's much harder to do."}, {"time": 9505, "text": "No question, but if you can do it."}, {"time": 9506, "text": "Oh, I'm maintaining, I can, no, I just said."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "Like, how did it come to this?"}, {"time": 9511, "text": "There's, but the point is there's alternatives that are perhaps more effective."}, {"time": 9517, "text": "In my perspective, this might be clueless, there's almost no clothing that's more effective than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "Like, I feel like clothing."}, {"time": 9529, "text": "Particularly when you start to add hitting, like every single time I start grabbing your clothes, if you start hitting and it's not like nothing could work, but most of the time you're like, why am I not using my arms for something better than what I'm doing them right now?"}, {"time": 9541, "text": "It's very difficult for me to, I don't know, in terms of just distance, I can't imagine a case of different distances, even like situations where, let's not talk about like, like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed that a fight is happening."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "Solid clothing?"}, {"time": 9562, "text": "Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket because you can snatch somebody on their face."}, {"time": 9565, "text": "Snatch down."}, {"time": 9566, "text": "Yeah, you know, it's like, if you, if you took my, like, you know, like you snap down and judo, like how easy it is to snap down a beginner."}, {"time": 9574, "text": "Actually a tie in that sense might be a really effective way to snap down."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "So like the snap down is really powerful to change the like disorient the situation and give you a lot of different opportunities for, you know, taking their back, taking them down."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "Doing hilarious stuff, like snapping them down with a tie into your knee."}, {"time": 9592, "text": "And then when they come back up doing this, you're already."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "So yeah, in that sense, I agree, but not as a choking mechanism because the concern Joe had is choke."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "I think you would probably choke me with your tie more easily than I could choke you with your tie."}, {"time": 9605, "text": "Cause like, if you get, you can get, like you get my back and you can put it around somebody's neck, you know, like, like, like, you ever see a diehard?"}, {"time": 9612, "text": "Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude or whatever was, it was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the, with the chain and then he ended up getting choked himself with the chain if I recall this properly."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "But anyway, yeah, like, like that."}, {"time": 9623, "text": "But I don't, I don't feel like, I feel like if I start grabbing your tie, you have too many other great options."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "I mean, I do like the snap down that you actually made me realize."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "No, I think you have a good there."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "I think you're on the right path with it."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "With a snap down?"}, {"time": 9636, "text": "Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these, like, you know, like, like you, like you poke your finger in my chest and then snap down real quick."}, {"time": 9643, "text": "And also, socially speaking, it's not a threatening thing to, you know, to reach for the tie."}, {"time": 9649, "text": "It's not particularly like a business setting."}, {"time": 9651, "text": "They'll never see it coming."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "Cause I was thinking choke, but it's not, it's a really good leverage point cause like grabbing a jacket, the jacket will slide if you try to snap down."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "You really have to get a hole, like a really good hold."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "Cause it's around the back of the neck."},

uh, continuous component."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Let's see, if we look for instance on the event networks, uh, recognizing images and people are able to show that the activations of these networks correlate very strongly, uh, with activations in visual cortex, uh, of some monkeys, the same seems to be true about language models."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Um, also if you, for instance, um, look, um, if you train agent in, um, 3d world, um, at first, you know, it, it, it, it barely recognizes what is going on over the time, it kind of recognizes foreground from a background over the time, it kind of knows where there is a foot, uh, and it just follows it."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Um, over the time it actually starts having a 3d perception."}, {"time": 802, "text": "So it is possible for instance, to look inside of the head of an agent and ask, what would it see if it looks to the right?"}, {"time": 809, "text": "And the crazy thing is, you know, initially when the agents are barely trained, that these predictions are pretty bad over the time they become better and better, you can still see that if you ask what happens when the head is turned by 360 degrees for some time, they think that the different thing appears and then at some stage they understand actually that the same thing supposed to appear."}, {"time": 832, "text": "So they get that understanding of 3d structure."}, {"time": 835, "text": "It's also, you know, very likely that they have inside some level of, of like a symbolic reasoning, like a particular, these symbols for other agents."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So when you look at DOTA agents, they collaborate together and, uh, and, uh, no, they, they, they, they have some anticipation of, uh, if, if they would win battle, they have some, some expectations with respect to other agents."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I might be, you know, too much anthropomorphizing, um, the, the, the, how the things look, look, look for me, but then the fact that they have a symbol for other agents, uh, makes me believe that, uh, at some stage as the, uh, you know, as they are optimizing for skills, they would have also symbol to describe themselves."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Uh, this is like a very useful symbol to have."}, {"time": 886, "text": "And this particularity, I would call it like a self consciousness or self awareness, uh, and, uh, still it might be different from the consciousness."}, {"time": 895, "text": "So I guess the, the way how I'm understanding the word consciousness, I'd say the experience of drinking a coffee or let's say experience of being a bat, that's the meaning of the word consciousness."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It doesn't mean to be awake."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Uh, yeah, it feels, it might be also somewhat related to memory and recurrent connections."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So, um, it's kind of like, if you look at anesthetic drugs, they might be, uh, uh, like, uh, that they essentially, they, they disturb, uh, uh, brainwaves, uh, such that, um, maybe memories, not, not form."}, {"time": 933, "text": "And so there's a lessening of consciousness when you do that."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And so that's the one way to intuit what is consciousness."}, {"time": 941, "text": "There's also kind of another element here."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It could be that it's, you know, this kind of self awareness module that you described, plus the actual subjective experience is a storytelling module that tells us a story about, uh, what we're experiencing."}, {"time": 965, "text": "The crazy thing."}, {"time": 966, "text": "So let's say, I mean, in meditation, they teach people not to speak story inside of their head."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And there is also some fraction of population who doesn't have actually a narrator, I know people who don't have a narrator and, you know, they have to use external people in order to, um, kind of solve tasks that require internal narrator."},

feels like, like the feeling is a story that is much, uh, much simpler abstraction than the raw sensory information."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So there feels like it's a very high level of abstraction that, uh, is useful for me to feel like entity in this world."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "M most useful aspect of it is that because I'm conscious, I think there's an intricate connection to me, not wanting to die."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So like, it's a useful hack to really prioritize not dying, like those seem to be somehow connected."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "So I'm telling the story of like, it's rich."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "He feels like something to be me and the fact that me exists in this world."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "I want to preserve me."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And so that makes it a useful agent hack."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So I will just refer maybe to that first part, as you said, about that kind of story of describing who you are."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Um, I was, uh, thinking about that even, so, you know, obviously I'm, I, I like thinking about consciousness, uh, I like thinking about AI as well, and I'm trying to see analogies of these things in AI, what would it correspond to?"}, {"time": 1157, "text": "The primary, it's the, and so, but the context we provide to GPT is, uh, is multimodal."}, {"time": 1165,

"Um, it's interesting that the, you know, people have a stories of who they are."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And, uh, as you said, these stories, they help them to operate in the world."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Um, but it's also, you know, interesting, I guess, various people find it out through meditation or so that, uh, there might be some patterns that you have learned when you were a kid that actually are not serving you anymore."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And you also might be thinking that that's who you are and that's actually just a story."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So it's a

1265, "text": "I don't think it would be conscious."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So in some sense, the question is, uh, what are the computations which could be conscious, uh, I mean, so, so one assumption is that it has to do purely with computation that you can abstract away matter and other possibilities that it's very important was the realization of computation that it has to do with some, uh, uh, force fields or so, and they bring consciousness."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "At the moment, my intuition is that it can be fully abstracted away."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So in case of computation, you can ask yourself, what are the mathematical objects or so that could bring such a properties?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So for instance, if we think about the models, uh, AI models, the, what they truly try to do, uh, or like a models like GPT is, uh, uh, you know, they try to predict, uh, next word or so."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And this turns out to be equivalent to, uh, compressing, uh, text."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Um, and, uh, because in some sense, compression means that, uh, you learn the model of reality and you have just to, uh, remember where are your mistakes."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "The better you are in predicting the, and, and, and in some sense, when we look at our experience, also, when you look, for instance, at the car driving, you know, in which direction it will go, you are good like in prediction."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And, um, you know, it might be the case that the consciousness is intertwined with, uh, compression, it might be also the case that self consciousness, uh, has to do with compress or trying to compress itself."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "So, um, okay."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I was just wondering, what are the objects in, you know, mathematics or computer science, which are mysterious that could, uh, that, that, that could have to do with consciousness."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And then I thought, um, you know, you, you see in mathematics, there is something called Gadel theorem, uh, which means, okay, you have, if you have sufficiently complicated mathematical system, it is possible to point the mathematical system back on itself."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "In computer science, there is, uh, something called helping problem."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "It's, it's somewhat similar construction."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So I thought that, you know, if we believe that, uh, that, uh, that under assumption that consciousness has to do with, uh, with compression, uh, then you could imagine that the, that the, as you keep on compressing things, then at some point, it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Metacompression consciousness is metacompression."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "That's a, that's an I, an, an, an idea."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And in some sense, you know, the crazy, thank you."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "So, uh, but do you think if we think of a Turing machine, a universal Turing machine, can that achieve consciousness?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So is there some thing beyond our traditional definition of computation that's required?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So it's a specific computation."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "And I said, this computation has to do with compression and, uh, the compression itself, maybe other way of putting it is like, uh, you are internally creating the model of reality in order, like, uh, it's like a, you try inside to simplify reality in order to predict what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And, um, that also feels somewhat similar to how I think actually about my own conscious experience, though clearly I don't have access to reality."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "The only access to reality is through, you know, cable going to my brain and my brain is creating a simulation of reality and I have access to the simulation of

"text": "Uh, Wikipedia pages, and, uh, there's a few qualities to it."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "One, I think has to be perfect compression, which makes, I think that little cork makes it much less, um, applicable to the general task of intelligence, because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Uh, like perfect compression is feels like it's not the right goal, but it's nevertheless a very interesting goal."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So for him, intelligence equals compression."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And so the smaller you make the file, given a large Wikipedia page, the more intelligent the system has to be."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Yeah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So you can make perfect compression if you store errors."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And I think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Uh, by the way, Hutter, Hutter is, uh, he was a PhD advisor of Sean Leck, who is a DeepMind, uh, uh, DeepMind cofounder."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So there's an interesting, uh, and now he's a DeepMind, there's an interesting, uh, network of people."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And he's one of the people that I think seriously took on the task of what would an AGI system look like?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Uh, I think for a longest time, the question of AGI was not taken seriously or rather rigorously."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So he developed the framework even to describe what's optimal with respect to reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "Like there is a theoretical framework, which is, as you said, under assumption, there is infinite amount of memory and compute."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Um, there was actually one person before his name is Solomonov, who there extended, uh, Solomonov work to reinforcement learning, but there exists the, uh, theoretical algorithm, which is optimal algorithm to build intelligence and I can actually explain you the algorithm."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So the task itself, can I just pause how absurd it is for brain in a skull, trying to explain the algorithm for intelligence, just go ahead."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "It is pretty crazy."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It is pretty crazy that, you know, the brain itself is actually so small and it can ponder, uh, how to design algorithms that optimally solve the problem of intelligence."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So what's the algorithm?"}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So first of all, the task itself is, uh, described as, uh, you have infinite sequence of zeros and ones."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "You read, uh, N bits and they are about to predict N plus one bit."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So that's the task."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And you could imagine that every task could be casted as such a task."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So if for instance, you have images and labels, you can just turn every image into a sequence of zeros and ones, then label, you concatenate labels and you, and that that's actually the, the, and you could, you could start by having training data first, and then afterwards you have test data."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So theoretically any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting zeros and ones on this, uh, infinite tape."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So, um, so let's say you read already N bits and you want to predict N plus one bit, and I will ask you to write every possible program that generates these N bits."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "So, um, and you can have, you, you choose programming language."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "It can be Python or C plus plus."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And the difference between programming languages, uh, might be, there is a difference by constant asymptotically, your predictions will be equivalent."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So you read N bits, you enumerate all the programs that produce these N bits in their output."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And then in order to predict N plus one bit, you actually weight the programs according to their length."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And there is like a, some specific formula, how you weight them."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And then the N plus, uh, one bit prediction is the prediction, uh, from each of these program, according to that weight."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Like statistically, you pick, so the smaller the program, the more likely you, you are to pick the, its output."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "So, uh, that's, that algorithm is grounded in the hope or the intuition that the simple answer is the right one."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "It's a formalization of it."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Um, it also means like, if you would ask the question after how many years would, you know, sun explode, uh, you can say, hmm, it's more likely the answer is due to some power because they're shorter program."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Um, then other, well, I don't have a good intuition about, uh, how different the space of short programs are from the space of large programs."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Like, what is the universe where short programs, uh, like run things?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "Uh, so, so I said, the things have to agree with N bits."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "So even if you have, you, you need to start, okay."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "If, if you have very short program and they're like a steel, some has, if, if it's not perfectly prediction of N bits, you have to start errors."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "What are the errors?"}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And that gives you the full program that agrees on N bits."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Oh, so you don't agree with the N bits."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And you store, that's like a longer, a longer program, slightly longer program because it can take these extra bits of errors."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "What's what's your intuition about the, the programs that are able to do cool stuff like intelligence and consciousness, are they, uh, perfectly like, is, is it, uh, is there if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1865, "text": "So like, is there a lot of a good, uh, if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So like, is there a lot of exceptions that they're storing?"}, {"time": 1871, "text": "So, um, you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of if statements, then they wouldn't be that short."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "In case of neural networks, you could imagine that, um, what happens is, uh, they, uh, when you start with an initialized neural network, uh, it stores internally many possibilities, how the, uh, how the problem can be solved."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "And SGD is kind of magnifying some, some, uh, some, uh, paths, which are slightly similar to the correct answer."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "So it's kind of magnifying correct programs."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And in some sense, SGD is a search algorithm in the program space and the program space is represented by, uh, you know, kind of the wiring inside of the neural network and there's like an insane number of ways how the features can be computed."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "Let me ask you the high level, basic question that's not so basic."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Is there a way you'd like to think of it that is different than like a generic textbook definition?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "The thing that I hinted just a second ago is maybe that, uh, closest to how I'm thinking these days about deep learning."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So, uh, now the statement is, uh, neural networks can represent some programs."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "Uh, it seems that various modules that we are actually adding up to, or like, uh, you know, we, we want networks to be deep because we, we want multiple steps of the computation and, uh, uh, and deep learning provides the way to represent space of programs, which is searchable and it's searchable with, uh, stochastic gradient descent."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So we have an algorithm to search over humongous number of programs and gradient descent kind of bubbles up the things that are, uh, tend to give correct answers."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So a neural network with a, with fixed weights that's optimized, do you think of that as a single program?"}, {"time": 1991, "text": "Um, so there is a, uh, work by Christopher Olaj where he, uh, so he works on interpretability of neural networks and he was able to, uh, to identify the neural network, for instance, a detector of a wheel for a car, or the detector of a mask for a car, and then he was able to separate them out and assemble them, uh, together using a simple program, uh, for the detector, for a car detector."},

that out, just like you can copy and paste it into a stack overflow that, so, uh, any program is a composition of smaller programs."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "I mean, the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the things to be more fuzzy than in case of programs."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Uh, in case of programs, you have this, like a branching this way or that way."}, {"time":

worked on a lot of."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "Fascinating projects, applications of neural networks."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "It doesn't have to be big and profound."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It can be a cool trick."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "I mean, I'm thinking about the trick, but like, uh, it's still, uh, I'm using to me that it works at all that let's say that the extremely simple algorithm stochastic gradient descent, which is something that I would be able to derive on the piece of paper to high school student, uh, when put at the, at the scale of, you know, thousands of

the, maybe an ego, people are saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there, you know, uh, could solve complicated problems."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "So they were in search for the other algorithms."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And as I'm saying, like, I believe that actually we are in the game where there is, there are actually frankly three levers."}, {"time": 2274,

studies to determine how much gains they were coming from different levers."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And so far we have seen that more gains came from compute than algorithms, but also we are in the

we are speaking about the, let's say all taxes in us."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "Uh, but you're talking about money that could be innovation in the compute."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "That's that's true as well."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Uh, so I mean, they're like a few pieces."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Um, so it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small."}, {"time": 2362,

and death task."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's, uh, the stakes are high."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So one goal for a therapist, whether human or AI is to prevent suicide ideation to prevent suicide."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "How do you achieve that?"}, {"time": 2485, "text": "So to be clear, I don't think that the current models are good enough for such a task because it requires insane amount of understanding, empathy, and the models are far from this place, but it's."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "But do you think that understanding empathy, that signal is in the data?"}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Um, I think there is some signal in the data."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "I mean, there are plenty of transcripts of conversations and it is possible to, it is possible from it to understand personalities."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So there's another underlying question, which is self supervised versus supervised."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So can you get that from the data by just reading a huge number of transcripts?"}, {"time": 2596, "text": "I actually, so I think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "It's like at the same way as you cannot learn to dance if just from YouTube by watching it, you have to actually try it out yourself."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And so I think that here that's a similar situation."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "I also wouldn't deploy the system in the high stakes situations right away, but kind of see gradually where it goes."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And, uh, obviously initially, uh, it would have to go hand in hand with humans."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "But, uh, at the moment we are in the situation that actually there is many more people who actually would like to have a therapy or, or speak with, with someone than there are therapies out there."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "I can, you know, I was so, so fundamentally I was thinking, what are the things that, uh, can vastly increase people's well being therapy is one of them being meditation is other one, I guess maybe human connection is a third one, and I guess pharmacologically it's also possible, maybe direct brain stimulation or something like that."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "But these are pretty much options out there."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Then let's say the way I'm thinking about the AGI endeavor is by default, that's an endeavor to, uh, increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And I believe that we can invest the increase amount of wealth for everyone and simultaneously."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "So, I mean, there are like a two endeavors that make sense to me."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "One is like essentially increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And second one is, uh, increase overall human wellbeing."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And those are coupled together and they, they can, like, uh, I would say these are different topics."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "One can help another and, uh, you know, therapist is a, is a funny word because I see friendship and love as therapy."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "I mean, so therapist broadly defined as just friendship as a friend."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "So like therapist is, has a very kind of clinical sense to it, but what is human connection you're like, uh, not to get all Camus and Dostoevsky on you, but you know, life is suffering and we draw, we seek connection with the humans as we, uh, desperately try to make sense of this world in a deep overwhelming loneliness that we feel inside."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So I think connection has to do with understanding."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And I think that almost like a lack of understanding causes suffering."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "If you speak with someone and do you, do you feel ignored that actually causes pain?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, very much agree."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So I thought in the past about, um, somewhat similar question to yours, which is what is love, uh, rather what is connection."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "And, um, and obviously I think about these things from AI perspective."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "What would it mean?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Um, so I said that, um, you know, intelligence has to do with some compression, which is more or less like I can say, almost understanding of what is going around."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "It seems to me that, uh, other aspect is there seem to be reward functions and you can have, uh, uh, you know, reward for, uh, food, for maybe human connection, for, uh, let's say warmth, uh, sex and so on."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And, um, and it turns out that the various people might be optimizing slightly different, uh, reward functions."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "They essentially might care about different things."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "And, uh, uh, in case of, uh, love at least the love between two people, you can say that the, um, you know, boundary between people dissolves to such extent that, uh, they end up optimizing each other reward functions and yeah, oh, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Um, celebrate the success of each other."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "In some sense, I would say love means, uh, helping others to optimize their, uh, reward functions, not your reward functions, not the things that you think are important, but the things that the person cares about, you try to help them to, uh, optimize it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So love is, uh, if you think of two reward functions, you just, it's a condition."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "You combine them together, pretty much maybe like with a weight and it depends like the dynamic of the relationship."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "So for instance, if you look at, at the donut on the one level, you might think, oh, this is like, it looks tasty."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "I would like to eat it on other level."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "You might tell yourself, I shouldn't be doing it because I want to gain muscles."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and you know, you might do it regardless kind of against yourself."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "And like, I try to imagine, try to imagine if there would be like a small baby Lex, like a five years old, angry, and then they are like, you shouldn't be angry."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "Like stop being angry."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "But like an instant, actually you want the Lex to come over, give him a hug and just like, I say, it's fine."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "It's going to be angry as long as you want."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And then he would stop or, or maybe not, or maybe not, but you cannot expect it even."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "But still, that doesn't explain the why of love."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "Like why is love part of the human condition?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Why is it useful to combine the reward functions?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "It seems like that doesn't, I mean, I don't think reinforcement learning frameworks can give us answers to why even, even the Hutter framework has an objective function that's static."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So we came to existence as a consequence of evolutionary process."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And in some sense, the purpose of evolution is survival."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And then the, this complicated optimization objective baked into us, let's say compression, which might help us operate in the real world and it baked into us various reward functions."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Then to be clear at the moment we are operating in the regime, which is somewhat out of distribution, where they even evolution optimized us."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "It's almost like love is a consequence of a cooperation that we've discovered is useful."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "In some way it's even the case."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "If you, I just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Or it's not out of distribution."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "It's like, as you said, it evolved for cooperation."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "So there is, we are wired actually even for love."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And at the moment, I guess, the, maybe it would be somewhat more beneficial if you will, if we would identify ourselves with all the humanity as a whole."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "So you can clearly see when people travel around the world, when they run into person from the same country, they say, oh, which CPR and all this, like all the sudden they find all these similarities."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "They find some, they befriended those folks earlier than others."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "So there is like a sense, some sense of the belonging."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "And I would say, I think it would be overall good thing to the world for people to move towards, I think it's even called open individualism, move toward the mindset of a larger and larger groups."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So the challenge there, that's a beautiful vision and I share it to expand that circle of empathy, that circle of love towards the entirety of humanity."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "But then you start to ask, well, where do you draw the line?"}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Because why not expand it to other conscious beings?"}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And then finally, for our discussion, something I think about is why not expand it to AI systems?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Like we, we start respecting each other when the, the person, the entity on the other side has the capacity to suffer."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Cause then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And so I could see AI systems that are interacting with humans more and more having conscious, like displays."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "So like they display consciousness through language and through other means."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And so then the question is like, well, is that consciousness?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Because they're acting conscious."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so, you know, the reason we don't like torturing animals is because they look like they're suffering when they're tortured and if AI looks like it's suffering when it's tortured, how is that not requiring of the same kind of empathy from us and respect and rights that animals do and other humans do?"}, {"time": 3215, "text": "I think it requires empathy as well."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "I mean, I would like, I guess us or humanity or so make a progress in understanding what consciousness is, because I don't want just to be speaking about that, the philosophy, but rather actually make a scientific, uh, to have a, like, you know, there was a time that people thought that there is a force of life and, uh, the things that have this force, they are alive."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "And, um, I think that there is actually a path to understand exactly what consciousness is and how it works."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "Understand exactly what consciousness is."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "And, uh, um, in some sense, it might require essentially putting probes inside of a human brain, uh, what Neuralink, uh, does."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "So the goal there, I mean, there's several things with consciousness that make it a real discipline, which is one is rigorous measurement of consciousness."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "And then the other is the engineering of consciousness, which may or may not be related."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "I mean, you could also run into trouble."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Like, for example, in the United States for the department, DOT, department of transportation, and a lot of different places put a value on human life."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "I think DOT is, uh, values $9 million per person."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Sort of in that same way, you can get into trouble."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "If you put a number on how conscious of being is, because then you can start making policy, if a cow is a 0.1 or like, um, 10% as conscious as a human, then you can start making calculations and it might get you into trouble."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "But then again, that might be a very good way to do it."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "I would like, uh, to move to that place that actually we have scientific understanding what consciousness is."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "And then we'll be able to actually assign value."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "And I believe that there is even the path for the experimentation in it."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "So, uh, you know, w we said that, you know, you could put the probes inside of the brain."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "There is actually a few other things that you could do with devices like Neuralink."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "So you could imagine that the way even to measure if AI system is conscious is by literally just plugging into the brain."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Um, I mean, that, that seems like it's kind of easy, but the plugging into the brain and asking person if they feel that their consciousness expanded, um, this direction of course has some issues."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "You can say, you know, if someone takes a psychedelic drug, they might feel that their consciousness expanded, even though that drug itself is not conscious."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "So like, you can't fully trust the self report of a person saying their, their consciousness is expanded or not."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Let me ask you a little bit about psychedelics is, uh, there've been a lot of excellent research on, uh, different psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, even DMT drugs in general, marijuana too."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "Uh, what do you think psychedelics do to the human mind?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "It seems they take the human mind to some interesting places."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Is that just a little, uh, hack, a visual hack, or is there some profound expansion of the mind?"}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So let's see, I don't believe in magic."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "I believe in, uh, I believe in, uh, in science in, in causality, um, still, let's say, and then as I said, like, I think that the brain, that the, our subjective experience of reality is, uh, we live in the simulation run by our brain and the simulation that our brain runs, they can be very pleasant or very hellish drugs, they are changing some hyper parameters of the simulation."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "It is possible thanks to change of these hyper parameters to actually look back on your experience and even see that the given things that we took for granted, they are changeable."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So they allow to have a amazing perspective."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "There is also, for instance, the fact that after DMT people can see the full movie inside of their head, gives me further belief that the brain can generate that full movie, that the brain is actually learning the model of reality to such extent that it tries to predict what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Very high resolution."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "So it can replay reality."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Extremely high resolution."},

started even these days to think about meditation as a psychedelic."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "Do you practice meditation?"}, {"time": 3504, "text": "I practice meditation."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "I mean, I went a few times on the retreats and it feels after like after second or third day of meditation, uh, there is a, there is almost like a sense of, you know, tripping what, what does the meditation retreat entail?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "So you w you wake up early in the morning and you meditate for extended period of time, uh, and yeah, so it's optimized, even though there are other people, it's optimized for isolation."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "So you don't speak with anyone."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "You don't actually look into other people's eyes and, uh, you know, you sit on the chair and say Vipassana meditation tells you, uh, to focus on the breath."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "So you try to put, uh, all the, all attention into breathing and, uh, breathing in and breathing out."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "And the crazy thing is that as you focus attention like that, uh, after some time, their stems starts coming back, like some memories that you completely forgotten, it almost feels like, uh, that you'll have a mailbox and then you know, you are just like a archiving email one by one."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "And at some point, at some point there is this like a amazing feeling of getting to mailbox zero, zero emails."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "And, uh, it's very pleasant."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "Are you, what are you experiencing?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Are you just taking in simple sensory information and they're just enjoying the rawness of that sensory information?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "So there's no, there's no memories or all

"Sometimes they pop up, but it's also somehow the extended meditation takes you to the space that they are way more friendly, way more positive."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Um, there is also this, uh, this thing that, uh, we've, it almost feels that the."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "It almost feels that the, we are constantly getting a little bit of a reward function and we are just spreading this reward function on various activities."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "But if you'll stay still for extended period of time, it kind of accumulates, accumulates, accumulates, and, uh, there is a, there is a sense, there is a sense that some point it passes some threshold and it feels as drop is falling into kind of ocean of love and this, and that's like, uh, this is like a very pleasant."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And that's, I'm saying like, uh, that corresponds to the subjective experience."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Some people, uh, I guess in spiritual community, they describe it that that's the reality, and I would say, I believe that they're like, uh, all sorts of subjective experience that one can have."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "And, uh, I believe that for instance, meditation might take you to the subjective experiences with the subject."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Vision might take you to the subjective experiences, which are very pleasant, collaborative."}, {"time": 3738,

think almost about it as a, you know, text prepended to GPT."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "And, uh, some people refer to it as ego."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "There's like a story who, who, who you are."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "So ego is the prompt for GPT three or GPT."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And that's description of you."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "And then with meditation, you can get to the point that actually you experience things without the prompt and you experience things like as they are, you are not biased over the description, how they supposed to be, uh, that's very pleasant."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And then we've respected the reward function."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "Uh, it's possible to get to the point that the, there is the solution of self."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "And therefore you can say that the, or you're having a, your, or like a, your brain attempts to simulate the reward function of everyone else or like everything that's that there is

"text": "And that might come, you know, from either meditation, psychedelics, or let's say I read just hundreds of books on this topic."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So, and I also went through a journey of, you know, I developed a lot of, uh, algorithms, so I think that maybe I can, that's my super human skill."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Uh, Ilya is, uh, one of the best AI scientists, but then I'm pretty good in assembling teams and I'm also not holding to people."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "Like I'm growing people and then people become managers at OpenAI."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "I grew many of them, like a research managers."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "So you, you find, you find places where you're excellent and he finds like his, his, his deep scientific insights is where he is and you find ways you can, the puzzle pieces fit together."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Like, uh, you know, ultimately, for instance, let's say Ilya, he doesn't manage people, uh, that's not what he likes or so."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Um, I like, I like hanging out with people."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "By default, I'm an extrovert and I care about people."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So that, that fits perfectly together."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "But I mean, uh, I also just like your intuition about various problems in machine learning."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "He's definitely one I really enjoy."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "I remember talking to him about something I was struggling with, which is coming up with a good model for pedestrians, for human beings across the street in the context of autonomous vehicles, and I was like, okay, in the context of autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And he immediately started to like formulate a framework within which you can evolve a model for pedestrians, like through self play, all that kind of mechanisms, the depth of thought on a particular problem, especially problems he doesn't know anything about is, is fascinating to watch."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "It makes you realize like, um, yeah, the, the, the limits of the, that the human intellect may be limitless, or it's just impressive to see a descendant of ape come up with clever ideas."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "I mean, so even in the space of deep learning, when you look at various people, there are people now who invented some breakthroughs once, but there are very few people who did it multiple times."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "And you can think if someone invented it once, that might be just a sheer luck."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And if someone invented it multiple times, you know, if a probability of inventing it once is one over a million, then probability of inventing it twice or three times would be one over a million square or, or to the power of three, which, which would be just impossible."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So it literally means that it's, it's given that, uh, it's not the luck."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "And Ilya is one of these few people who, uh, uh, who have, uh, a lot of these inventions in his arsenal."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "It also feels that, um, you know, for instance, if you think about folks like Gauss or Euler, uh, you know, at first they read a lot of books and then they did thinking and then they figure out math and that's how it feels with Ilya, you know, at first he read stuff and then like he spent his thinking cycles."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And that's a really good way to put it."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "When I talk to him, I, I see thinking."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "He's actually thinking, like, he makes me realize that there's like deep thinking that the human mind can do."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "Like most of us are not thinking deeply."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "Uh, like you really have to put in a lot of effort to think deeply."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Like I have to really put myself in a place where I think deeply about a problem, it takes a lot of effort."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "It's like, uh, it's like an airplane taking off or something."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "You have to achieve deep focus."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "He he's just, uh, he's what is it?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "He said, what does it, his brain is like a vertical takeoff in terms of airplane analogy."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "So it's interesting, but it, I mean, Cal Newport talks about this as ideas of deep work."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "It's, you know, most of us don't work much at all in terms of like, like deeply think about particular problems, whether it's a math engineering, all that kind of stuff, you want to go to that place often and that's real hard work."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And some of us are better than others at that."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So I think that the big piece has to do with actually even engineering your environment that says that it's conducive to that."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "So, um, see both Ilya and I, uh, on the frequent basis, we kind of disconnect ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "So Ilya usually, he just, uh, leaves iPad at hand."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "He loves his iPad."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And, uh, for me, I'm even sometimes, you know, just going for a few days to different location to Airbnb, I'm turning off my phone and there is no access to me and, uh, that's extremely important for me to be able to actually just formulate new thoughts, to do deep work rather than to be reactive."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "And the, the, the older I am, the more of these random tasks are at hand."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Before I go on to that, uh, thread, let me return to our friend, GPT."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And let me ask you another ridiculously big question."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "Can you give an overview of what GPT three is, or like you say in your Twitter bio, GPT N plus one, how it works and why it works."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "So, um, GPT three is a humongous neural network."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "Um, let's assume that we know what is neural network, the definition, and it is trained on the entire internet and just to predict next word."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "So let's say it sees part of the, uh, article and it, the only task that it has at hand, it is to say what would be the next word and what would be the next word and it becomes a really exceptional at the task of figuring out what's the next word."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So you might ask, why would, uh, this be an important, uh, task?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Why would it be important to predict what's the next word?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "And it turns out that a lot of problems, uh, can be formulated, uh, as a text completion problem."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So GPT is purely, uh, learning to complete the text."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "And you could imagine, for instance, if you are asking a question, uh, who is the president of the United States, then GPT can give you an answer to it."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "It turns out that many more things can be formulated this way."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "You can format text in the way that you have sentence in English."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You make it even look like some content of a website, uh, elsewhere, which would be teaching people how to translate things between languages."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "So it would be EN colon, uh, text in English, FR colon, and then you'll uh, uh, and then you'll ask people and then you ask model to, to continue."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "And it turns out that the, such a model is predicting translation from English to French."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "The crazy thing is that this model can be used for way more sophisticated tasks."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So you can format text such that it looks like a conversation between two people."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And that might be a conversation between you and Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And because the model read all the texts about Elon Musk, it will be able to predict Elon Musk words as it would be Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "It will speak about colonization of Mars, about sustainable future and so on."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "And it's also possible to, to even give arbitrary personality to the model."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "You can say, here is a conversation that we've a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And the model, uh, will complete the text as a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "So, I mean, how do I express how amazing this is?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "So just to clarify, uh, a conversation, generating a conversation between me and Elon Musk, it wouldn't just generate good examples of what Elon would say."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "It would get the same results as the conversation between Elon Musk and me."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Say it would get the syntax all correct."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "So like interview style, it would say like Elon call and Lex call, like it, it's not just like, uh, inklings of, um, semantic correctness."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's like the whole thing, grammatical, syntactic, semantic, it's just really, really impressive, uh, generalization."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "I mean, I also want to, you know, provide some caveats so it can generate few paragraphs of coherent text, but as you go to, uh, longer pieces, it, uh, it actually goes off the rails."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "If you try to write a book, it won't work out this way."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "What way does it go off the rails, by the way?"}, {"time": 4727, "text": "Is there interesting ways in which it goes off the rails?"}, {"time": 4730, "text": "Like what falls apart first?"}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So the model is trained on the, all the existing data, uh, that is out there, which means that it is not trained on its own mistakes."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "So for instance, if it would make a mistake, then, uh, I kept, so to give you, give you an example."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "So let's say I have a conversation with a model pretending that is Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "And then I start putting some, uh, I'm start actually making up things which are not factual."},

will just keep on carrying it on."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And as if it's true."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And in some sense, if you would have a normal conversation with Elon, he would be what the fuck."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "There'll be some feedback between, so the model is trained on things that humans have written, but through the generation process, there's no human in the loop

of all, humans have the same problem."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "It's just that we, uh, we'll make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "I think that actually what happens with humans is if you have a wrong belief about the world as a kid, then very quickly we'll learn that it's not correct because they are grounded in reality and they are learning from your new

the absence of Elon Musk being your wife information on the internet, won't it correct itself?"}, {"time": 4843, "text": "There won't be examples like that."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So the errors will be subtle at first."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "Subtle at first."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "And in some sense, you can also say that the data that is not out there is the data, which would

you think?"}, {"time": 4866, "text": "Like when you think about the nature of intelligence, it seems exceptionally impressive."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "But then if you think about the big AGI problem, is this footsteps along the way to AGI?"}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So let's see, it seems that intelligence itself is, there are multiple axis of it."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And I would expect that the systems that we are building, they might end up being superhuman on some axis and subhuman on some other axis."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "It would be surprising to me on all axis

like the spaceship to the moon is actually effective."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "So people who criticize GPT, they say, you guys just building a taller, a ladder, and it will never reach the moon."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "And at the moment, I would say the way I'm thinking is, is like a scientific question."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And I'm also in heart, I'm a builder creator and like, I'm thinking, let's try out, let's see how far it goes."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "And so far we see constantly that there is a progress."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So do you think GPT four, GPT five, GPT N plus one will, um, there'll be a phase shift, like a transition to a, to a place where we'll be truly surprised."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "Then again, like GPT three is already very like truly surprising."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "The people that criticize GPT three as a stair, as a, what is it?"}, {"time": 4984, "text": "Ladder to heaven."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "I think too quickly get accustomed to how impressive it is that they're impressive, it is that the prediction of the next word can achieve such depth of semantics, accuracy of syntax, grammar, and semantics."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Um, do you, do you think GPT four and five and six will continue to surprise us?"}, {"time": 5008, "text": "I mean, definitely there will be more impressive models that there is a question of course, if there will be a phase shift and, uh, the, also even the way I'm thinking about the, about these models is that when we build these models, you know, we see some level of the capabilities, but we don't even fully understand everything that the model can do."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "And actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to probe the model to even see what is possible."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "Hence the, the using GPT as an API and opening it up to the world."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "I mean, so when I'm thinking from perspective of like, uh, obviously various people are, that have concerns about AGI, including myself."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Um, and then when I'm thinking from perspective, what's the strategy even to deploy these things to the world, then the one strategy that I have seen many times working is that iterative deployment that you deploy, um, slightly better versions and you allow other people to criticize you."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "So you actually, or try it out, you see where are their fundamental issues."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "And it's almost, you don't want to be in that situation that you are holding into powerful system and there's like a huge overhang, then you deploy it and it might have a random chaotic impact on the world."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So you actually want to be in the situation that they are gradually deploying systems."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "I asked this question of Illya, let me ask you, uh, you this question."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "I've been reading a lot about Stalin and power."}, {"time": 5109, "text": "If you're in possession of a system that's like AGI, that's exceptionally powerful, do you think your character and integrity might become

collective."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "So the thing is that requires a George Washington style move in the ascent to power, there's always a moment when somebody gets a lot of power and they have to

ourselves the development of AI without distributing the power because we want to defend ourselves against China, against Russia, that kind of, that kind of logic."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "And, um, I wonder how we, um, how we design governance mechanisms that, um, prevent us from becoming power hungry and in the process, destroying ourselves."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So let's see, I have been

even to distribute wealth."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "Um, and he's proper, he proposed in his blog, uh, to tax, uh, equity of the companies rather than profit and to distribute it."}, {"time": 5231,

using."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "That's the set of the variables that is initialized."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "And on the spot, it can actually tell you what to do."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "So the interesting thing is, and we think that the copilot is one possible product using codecs, but there is a place for many more."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "So internally we tried out, you know, to create other fun products."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So it turns out that a lot of tools out there, let's say Google calendar or Microsoft word or so, they all have a internal API to build plugins around them."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or Microsoft word."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Today, if you want, if you want more complicated behaviors from these programs, you have to add the new button for every behavior."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "But it is possible to use codecs and tell for instance, to calendar, uh, could you schedule an appointment with Lex next week after 2 PM and it writes corresponding piece of code."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "And that's the thing that actually you want."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "So you figure out is there's a lot of programs with which you can interact through code."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And so there you can generate that code from natural language."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And that's somewhat like also closest to what was the promise of Siri or Alexa."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So previously all these behaviors, they were hard coded and it seems that codecs on the fly can pick up the API of let's say, given software."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And then it can turn language into use of this API."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So without hard coding, you can find, it can translate to machine language."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "To, uh, so for example, this would be really exciting for me, like for, um, Adobe products, like Photoshop, uh, which I think action scripted, I think there's a scripting language that communicates with them, same with Premier."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "And do you could imagine that that allows even to do coding by voice on your phone?"},

5835, "text": "But if I would be able to tell, uh, to my phone, you know, uh, make the header large, then move the paragraphs around and that's actually what I want."}, {"time": 5845, "text": "So I can tell you one more cool thing, or even how I'm thinking about codecs."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So if you look actually at the evolution of, uh, of computers, we started with a very primitive interfaces, which is a punch card and punch card."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So Charlie, you make a holes in the, in the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And, uh, during that time, there was a small number of specialists who were able to use computers."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And by the way, people even suspected that there is no need for many more people to use computers."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Um, but then we moved from punch cards to at first assembly and see, and at these programming languages, they were slightly higher level."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "They allowed many more people to code and they also, uh, led to more of a proliferation of technology."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And, uh, you know, further on, there was a jump to say from C++ to Java and Python."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "And every time it has happened, more people are able to code and we build more technology."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "And it's even, you know, hard to imagine now, if someone will tell you that you should write code in assembly instead of let's say, Python or Java or JavaScript."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "And codecs is yet another step toward kind of bringing computers closer to humans such that you communicate with a computer with your own language rather than with a specialized language, and, uh, I think that it will lead to an increase of number of people who can code."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "And then, and the kind of technologies that those people will create is it's innumerable, it could, you know, it could be a huge number of technologies."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "We're not predicting at all because that's less and less requirement of having a technical mind, a programming mind, you're not opening it to the world of, um,

spend a lot of time learning it."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "And I, I believe that's a good thing to the world."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "And I would actually add, I would add, so at the moment I'm a managing codecs team and also language team, and I believe that there is like a plenty of brilliant people out there and they should have a lot of experience."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "There and they should apply."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "So what's the language and the codecs is, so those are kind of, they're overlapping teams."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "It's like GPT, the raw language, and then the codecs is like applied to programming."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "And they are quite intertwined."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "There are many more things involved making this, uh, models, uh, extremely efficient and deployable."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "For instance, there are people who are working to, you know, make our data centers, uh, amazing, or there are people who work on putting these models into production or, uh, or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So all aspects from, from the infrastructure to the actual machine."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "So I'm just saying there are multiple teams while the, and the team working on codecs and language, uh, I guess I'm, I'm directly managing them."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "I would like, I would love to hire more interested in machine learning."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "This is probably one of the most exciting problems and like systems to be working on is it's actually, it's, it's, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "Like what, what, uh, the program synthesis, like generating a programs is very interesting, very interesting problem that has echoes of reasoning and intelligence in it."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It's and I think there's a lot of fundamental questions that you might be able to sneak, uh, sneak up to by generating programs."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "Yeah, that one more exciting thing about the programs is that, so I said that the, um, you know, the, in case of language, that one of the travels is even evaluating language."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "So when the things are made up, you, you need somehow either a human to, to say that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program, there is one extra lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So that process might be somewhat, uh, more automated in, in order to improve the, uh, qualities of generations."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "So like the, wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "So, so for the language, the, you know, the simulation to actually execute it as a human mind."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "For programs, there is a, there is a computer on which you can evaluate it."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "That's a brilliant little insight."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "Insight that the thing compiles and runs that's first and second, you can evaluate on a, like do automated unit testing and in some sense, it seems to me that we'll be able to make a tremendous progress."}, {"time": 6132,

controlling a nuclear power plant has to be very reliable."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "So I wouldn't start with controlling nuclear power plant maybe one day, but that's not actually, that's not on the current roadmap."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "That's not the step one."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And you know, it's the Russian thing."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "You just want to go to the most powerful, destructive, most powerful the most powerful, destructive thing right away run by JavaScript."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "But I got you."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "So this is a lower impact, but nevertheless, when you make me realize it is possible to achieve some levels of reliability by doing testing."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "And you could, you could imagine that, you know, maybe there are ways for model to write event code for testing itself and so on, and there exists a ways to create the feedback loops that the model could keep on improving."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "By writing programs that generate tests for the instance, for instance."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And that's how we get consciousness, because it's metacompression."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "That's what you're going to write."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "That's the comment."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "That's the prompt that generates consciousness."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "Compressor of compressors."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "You just write that."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Do you think the code that generates consciousness will be simple?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "I mean, ultimately, the core idea behind will be simple, but there will be also decent amount of engineering involved."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "Like in some sense, it seems that, you know, spreading these models on many machines, it's not that trivial."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And we find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I believe that first models that I guess are conscious or like a truly intelligent, they will have all sorts of tricks, but then again, there's a Richard Sutton argument that maybe the tricks are temporary things that they might be temporary things and in some sense, it's also even important to, to know that even the cost of a trick."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "So sometimes people are eager to put the trick while forgetting that there is a cost of maintenance or like a long term cost, long term cost or maintenance, or maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "So even if you have something that gives you 2x, but it requires, you know, 1000 lines of code, I'm not sure if it's actually worth it."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So in some sense, you know, if it's five lines of code and 2x, I would take it."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And we see many of this, but also, you know, that requires some level of, I guess, lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "So you led the OpenAI robotics team."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Can you give an overview of the cool things you were able to accomplish, what are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6322, "text": "So when we started robotics, we knew that actually reinforcement learning works and it is possible to solve fairly complicated problems."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "Like for instance, AlphaGo is an evidence that it is possible to build superhuman Go players, DOTA2 is an evidence that it's possible to build superhuman agents playing DOTA, so I asked myself a question, you know, what about robots out there?"}, {"time": 6348, "text": "Could we train machines to solve arbitrary tasks in the physical world?"}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Our approach was, I guess, let's pick a complicated problem that if we would solve it, that means that we made some significant progress in the domain."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And if can progress the domain, and then we went after the problem."}, {"time": 6368, "text": "So we noticed that actually the robots out there, they are kind of at the moment optimized per task, so you can have a robot that it's like, if you have a robot opening a bottle, it's very likely that the end factor is that bottle opener."}, {"time": 6384, "text": "And the, and in some sense, that's a hack to be able to solve a task, which makes any task easier and ask myself, so what would be a robot that can actually solve many tasks?"}, {"time": 6395, "text": "And we conclude that human hands have such a quality that indeed they are, you know, you have five kind of tiny arms attached individually."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "They can manipulate pretty broad spectrum of objects."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "So we went after a single hand, like trying to solve Rubik's cube single handed."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "We picked this task because we thought that there is no way to hard code it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it's also, we picked the robot on which it would be hard to hard code it."}, {"time": 6425, "text": "And we went after the solution such that it could generalize to other problems."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "And just to clarify, it's one robotic hand solving the Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "The hard part isn't the solution to the Rubik's cube is the manipulation of the, of like having it not fall out of the hand, having it use the, uh, five baby arms to, uh, what is it like rotate different parts of the Rubik's cube to achieve the solution."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part about that?"}, {"time": 6458, "text": "What was the approach taken there?"}, {"time": 6460, "text": "What are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6461, "text": "Obviously we have like a strong belief in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And, uh, you know, one path it is to do reinforcement learning, the real world other path is to, uh, uh, that simulation in some sense, the tricky part about the real world is at the moment, our models, they require a lot of data and there is essentially no data."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And, uh, I did, we decided to go through the path of the simulation."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And in simulation, you can have infinite amount of data."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "The tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And also can you in simulation represent everything that you represent otherwise in the real world."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "How do you generate the different simulations?"}, {"time": 6531, "text": "So, uh, you know, there's plenty of parameters out there."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "We just pick them randomly."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "And, uh, and in simulation model just goes for thousands of years and keeps on solving Rubik's cube in each of them."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And the thing is that neural network that we used, it has a memory."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And as it presses, for instance, the side of the, of the cube, it can sense, oh, that's actually, this side was, uh, difficult to press."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "There's probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "Um, so maybe, uh, put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you'll know exactly what, uh, what Jack is talking about."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work?"}, {"time": 6624, "text": "So the hardest part is at the moment when it comes to, uh, physical work, when it comes to robots, uh, they require maintenance, it's hard to replicate a million times it's, uh, it's also, it's hard to replay things exactly."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "I remember this situation that one guy at our company, he had like a model that performs way better than other models in solving Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "And, uh, you know, we kind of didn't know what's going on, why it's that."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "And, uh, it turned out, uh, that, you know, he was running it from his laptop that had better CPU or better, maybe local GPU as well."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And, uh, because of that, there was less of a latency and the model was the same."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "And that actually made solving Rubik's cube more reliable."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So in some sense, there might be some subtle bugs like that when it comes to running things in the real world."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "Even hinting on that, you could imagine that the initial models you would like to have models, which are insanely huge neural networks, and you would like to give them even more time for thinking."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "And when you have these real time systems, uh, then you might be constrained actually by the amount of latency."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "And, uh, ultimately I would like to build a system that it is worth for you to wait five minutes because it gives you the answer that you're willing to wait for five minutes."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "So latency is a very unpleasant constraint under which to operate."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "And also there is actually one more thing, which is tricky about robots."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "Uh, there is actually, uh, no, uh, not much data."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "So the data that I'm speaking about would be a data of, uh, first person experience from the robot and like a gigabytes of data like that, if we would have gigabytes of data like that, of robots solving various problems, it would be very easy to make a progress on robotics."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "And you can see that in case of text or code, there is a lot of data, like a first person perspective, they don't writing code."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "So you would invest, that's just one way to do it, invest in human supervision, like direct human control of the robots as it's learning and over time, add more and more automation."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So let's say that's how I would build a robotics company today."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "If I would be building a robotics company, which is, you know, spend 10 million dollars or so recording human trajectories, controlling a robot."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "After you find a thing that the robot should be doing, that there's a market fit for, like you can make a lot of money with that product."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "Uh, so I would record data and then I would essentially train supervised learning model on it."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "That might be the path today."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "I think that actually what is needed is to have a robot that can train powerful models over video."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So, um, you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like Dali and people are looking into models, generating videos, they're like, uh, bodies, algorithmic questions, even how to do it."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "And it's unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose, but, uh, I, I suspect that the models that which would have a level of understanding of video, same as GPT has a level of understanding of text, could be used, uh, to train robots to solve tasks."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "They would have a lot of common sense."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "If one day, I'm pretty sure one day there will be a robotics company by robotics company, I mean, the primary source of income is, is from robots that is worth over $1 trillion."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "What do you think that company will do?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "I think self driving cars."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "No, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "Cause my mind went to personal robotics, robots in the home."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "It seems like there's much more market opportunity there."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "I think it's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "I mean, this, this, this might speak to something important, which is I understand self driving much better than understand robotics in the home."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "So I understand how difficult it is to actually solve self driving to a, to a level, not just the actual computer vision and the control problem and just the basic problem of self driving, but creating a product that would undeniably be, um, that will cost less money."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "Like it will save you a lot of money, like orders of magnitude, less money that could replace Uber drivers, for example."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "So car sharing that's autonomous, that creates a similar or better experience in terms of how quickly you get from A to B or just whatever, the pleasantness of the experience, the efficiency of the experience, the value of the experience, and at the same time, the car itself costs cheaper."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "I think that's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "I think there's a lot more, um, low hanging fruit in the home."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "That, that, that could be, I also want to give you a perspective on like how challenging it would be at home or like it maybe kind of depends on that exact problem that you'd be solving."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Like if we're speaking about these robotic arms and hands, these things, they cost tens of thousands of dollars or maybe a hundred K and, um, you know, maybe, obviously, maybe there would be economy of scale."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "These things would be cheaper, but actually for any household to buy it, the price would have to go down to maybe a thousand bucks."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "I personally think that, uh, so self driving car, it provides a clear service."}, {"time": 7004, "text": "I don't think robots in the home, there'll be a trillion dollar company will just be all about service, meaning it will not necessarily be about like a robotic arm that's helps you."}, {"time": 7016, "text": "I don't know, open a bottle or wash the dishes or, uh, any of that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7022, "text": "It has to be able to take care of that whole, the therapist thing."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "You mentioned, I think that's, um, of course there's a line between what is a robot and what is not like, does it really need a body?"}, {"time": 7034, "text": "But you know, some, um, uh, AI system with some embodiment, I think."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "So the tricky part when you think actually what's the difficult part is, um, when the robot has like, when there is a diversity of the environment with which the robot has to interact, that becomes hard."}, {"time": 7051, "text": "So, you know, on the one spectrum, you have, uh, industrial robots as they are doing over and over the same thing, it is possible to some extent to prescribe the movements and we've very small amount of intelligence, the, the movement can be repeated millions of times."}, {"time": 7068, "text": "Um, the, it, there are also, you know, various pieces of industrial robots where it becomes harder and harder."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "I can, for instance, in case of Tesla, it might be a matter of putting a, a rack inside of a car and, you know, because the rack kind of moves around, it's, uh, it's not that easy."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "It's not exactly the same every time."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "That's not being the case that you need actually humans to do it."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "Uh, while, you know, welding cars together, it's a very repetitive process."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "Um, then in case of self driving itself, uh, that difficulty has to do with the diversity of the environment, but still the car itself, um, the problem that they are solving is you try to avoid even interacting with things."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "You are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "And then if you would have in the home, uh, robot that, you know, has to touch things and like if these things, they change the shape, if there is a huge variety of things to be touched, then that's difficult."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "If you are speaking about the robot, which there is, you know, head that is smiling in some way with cameras that either doesn't, you know, touch things."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "That's relatively simple."}, {"time": 7135, "text": "So to both agree and to push back."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "So you're referring to touch, like soft robotics, like the actual touch, but."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "I would argue that you could formulate just basic interaction between, um, like non contact interaction is also a kind of touch and that might be very difficult to solve that's the basic, this not disagreement, but that's the basic open question to me with self driving cars and this agreement with Elon, which is how much interaction is required to solve self driving cars."}, {"time": 7171, "text": "How much touch is required?"}, {"time": 7173, "text": "You said that in your intuition, touch is not required."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And my intuition to create a product that's compelling to use, you're going to have to, uh, interact with pedestrians, not just avoid pedestrians, but interact with them when we drive around."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "In major cities, we're constantly threatening everybody's life with our movements, um, and that's how they respect us."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "There's a game to ready going out with pedestrians and I'm afraid you can't just formulate autonomous driving as a collision avoidance problem."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "So I think it goes beyond like a collision avoidance is the first order approximation."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "Uh, but then at least in case of Tesla, you can't just at least in case of Tesla, they are gathering data from people driving their cars and I believe that's an example of supervised data that they can train their models, uh, on, and they are doing it, uh, which, you know, can give a model dislike, uh, another level of, uh, of, uh, behavior that is needed to actually interact with the real world."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "It's interesting how much data is required to achieve that."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "Um, w what do you think of the whole Tesla autopilot approach, the computer vision based approach with multiple cameras and there's a data engine."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "It's a multitask, multiheaded neural network, and it's this fascinating process of, uh, similar to what you're talking about with the robotics approach, uh, which is, you know, you deploy in your own network and then there's humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch of places and that stuff is sent back."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So like the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge cases are sent back for supervised annotation, thereby improving

you know, collecting trajectories from humans, that's like a first step and then you deploy the system and then you have humans revising the, all the issues."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "And in some sense, like at this approach converges to system that doesn't make mistakes because for the cases where there are mistakes, you got their data, how to fix them and the system will keep on improving."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So there's a very, to me, difficult question of how hard that, you know, how long that converging takes, how hard it is."}, {"time": 7324, "text": "The other

7355, "text": "So the bar is set much higher than for humans."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And so if there's a death in an autonomous vehicle, that's seen as a much more, much more dramatic than a death in the human driven vehicle."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "Part of the success of deployment of robots is figuring out how to make robots part of society, both on the, just the human side, on the media

given things can be trusted and, you know, trust is also like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it and damage it."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "And I think that's actually very common with, with innovation, that there's some resistance toward it and it's just the natural progression."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So in some sense, people will have to keep on proving that indeed these

what happens."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "And I mean, in some sense, that's actually what happens over the years in AI that like, we get used to things very quickly."}, {"time": 7610, "text": "You know something, I talked to Rodney Brooks."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "He called AlphaZero homework problem."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "Cause he was saying like, there's nothing special about it."},

these AI systems will at first seen the tremendous progress in digital space."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "And the, you know, the main thing about digital space is also that you can, everything is that

you first, do you remember when you first kind of connected with Python, maybe even fell in love with Python?"}, {"time": 564, "text": "It was a process."}, {"time": 565, "text": "It took about a year."}, {"time": 566, "text": "I first encountered Python in 1997."}, {"time": 569, "text": "I was a graduate student studying biomedical engineering at the Mayo Clinic."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And

actually, to see how this emergent cooperation, unstructured cooperation happens in the open source world that led to a lot of this collective programming, which is something maybe we might get into a little later, but what that looks like."}, {"time": 646, "text": "What gap did Numeric fill?"}, {"time": 648, "text": "Numeric filled the gap of having an array object."}, {"time": 650, "text": "There was no array object."}, {"time": 651, "text": "There was no array."}, {"time": 652, "text": "There was a one dimensional byte concept, but there was no n dimensional, two, three, four dimensional

to think in arrays."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So I was looking for that, and it had complex numbers, a lot of programming languages."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And you can see it because, if you're just a computer scientist, you think, ah, complex numbers are just two floats."}, {"time": 692, "text": "So you can, people can build that on."}, {"time": 694, "text": "But in practice, a complex

actually we all think of this the same way, which is both powerful and dangerous, right?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "Because powerful in that we now can quickly make bigger and higher level things on top of those abstractions dangerous because it also limits us as to the things we maybe left behind in producing that abstraction, which is at the heart of programming today and actually building around the programming world."}, {"time": 744, "text": "I think it's a fascinating philosophical topic."}, {"time": 746, "text": "Yeah, they will continue for many years, I think."}, {"time": 748,

heard of, I'm sure."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And I've met the creators and I liked Julia."}, {"time": 775, "text": "It's a really cool language, but they struggled to kind of against the, just the tide of like this inertia of people using Python."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And, you know, there's strategies to approach that, but nonetheless, it's a phenomena."}, {"time": 787, "text": "And sometimes, so I love complex numbers and I love to raise, so I looked at Python."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And then I had the experience, I did some stuff in Python and I was just doing my PhD."},

and observe those waves, like you can actually measure them."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And then you do mathematical inversion to see what the elasticity is."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And so that's the problem I was solving is how to do that with both ultrasound and MRI."}, {"time": 819, "text": "I needed some tool to do that with."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So I was starting to use Python in 97."},

this."}, {"time": 842, "text": "This is something I can retain without becoming an expert per se."}, {"time": 847, "text": "And so that led me to go, I'm gonna push more into this."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And then that 98 was kind of when I started to fall in love with Python, I would say."}, {"time": 858, "text": "A few peculiar things about Python."}, {"time": 860, "text": "So maybe compare it to Perl, compare it to some of the other languages."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So there's no braces."}, {"time": 867, "text": "So space is used, indentation, I should say, is used as part of the language."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So did you, I mean, that's quite a leap."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Were you comfortable with that leap or were you just very open minded?"}, {"time": 883, "text": "I was open minded, so I was cognizant of the concern."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And it definitely has, it has specific challenges."}, {"time": 892, "text": "You know, cut and pasting."}, {"time": 893, "text": "For example, when you're cut and pasting code, and if your editors aren't supportive of that, if you're putting it into a terminal, and particularly in the past when terminals didn't necessarily have the intelligence to manage it now."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Now, I, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks handle that just fine, so there's really no problem."}, {"time": 906, "text": "But in the past, it created some challenges, formatting challenges, also mixed tabs and spaces."}, {"time": 912, "text": "If editors weren't, you weren't clear on what was happening, you would have these issues."}, {"time": 916, "text": "So there were really concrete reasons about it that I heard and understood."}, {"time": 920, "text": "I never really encountered a problem with it personally."}, {"time": 923, "text": "Like, it was occasional annoyances, but I really liked the fact that it didn't have all this extra characters, right?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "That these extra characters didn't show up in my visual field when I was just trying to process understanding a snippet of code."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Yeah, there's a cleanness to it."}, {"time": 939, "text": "But, I mean, the idea is supposed to be that Perl also has a cleanness to it because of the minimalism of how many characters it takes to express a certain thing."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So it's very compact."}, {"time": 949, "text": "But what you realize with that compactness comes, there's a culture that prizes compactness, and so the code gets more and more compact and less and less readable to a point where it's like, like, to be a good programmer in Perl, you write code that's basically unreadable."}, {"time": 967, "text": "There's a culture, like."}, {"time": 969, "text": "Correct, and you're proud of it."}, {"time": 970, "text": "Yeah, you're proud of it."}, {"time": 972, "text": "Right, exactly, and it's like, feels good."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And it's really selective."}, {"time": 976, "text": "It means you have to be an expert in Perl to understand it."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Whereas Python allowed you not to have to be an expert."}, {"time": 982, "text": "You didn't have to take all this brain energy."}, {"time": 984, "text": "You could leverage, what I say, you could leverage your English language center, which you're using all the time."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I've wondered about other languages, particularly non Latin based languages."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Latin based languages with the characters are at least similar."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I think people have an easier time, but I don't know what it's like to be a Japanese or a Chinese person trying to learn different syntax."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Like, what would computer programming look like in that?"}, {"time": 1009, "text": "I haven't looked at that at all, but it certainly doesn't, you know, leveraging your Chinese language center, I'm not sure Python or any programming does that."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "But that was a big deal."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The fact that it was accessible, I could be a scientist."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "What I really liked is many programming languages really demand a lot of you, and you can get a lot, you know, you do a lot if you learn it."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "But Python enables you to do a lot without demanding a lot of you."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "There's nuance to that statement, but it certainly was, it's more accessible."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "So more people could actually, as a scientist, as somebody who, or an engineer, who was trying to solve another problem besides point programming, I could still use this language and get things done and be happy about it."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And I was also comfortable in C at that time."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And MATLAB, you did a little bit of that."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And MATLAB, I did a lot before that, exactly."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "So I was comfortable in, those three languages were really the tools I used during my studies and schooling."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "But to your point about language helping you think, one of the big things about MATLAB was it was, and APL before it, I don't know if you remember APL."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "APL is actually the predecessor of array based programming, which I think is really an underappreciated, if I talk to people who are just steeped in computer programming, computer science, like most of the people that Microsoft has hired in the past, for example, Microsoft as a company generally did not understand array based programming."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Like culturally, they didn't understand it."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So they kept missing the boat, kept missing the understanding of what this was."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "They've gotten better, but there's still a whole culture of folks that doesn't, programming, that's systems programming or web programming or lists and maps."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And what about an n dimensional array?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Oh yeah, that's just an implementation detail."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Well, you can think that, but then actually if you have that as a construct, you actually think differently."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "APL was the first language to understand that."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "And it was in the sixties, right?"}, {"time": 1113, "text": "The challenge of APL is APL had very dense, not only glyphs, like new characters, new glyphs, but they even had a new keyboard because to produce those glyphs, this is back in the early days in computing when the QWERTY keyboard maybe wasn't as established, like, well, we can have a new keyboard, no big deal."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "But it was a big deal and it didn't catch on."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And the language APL, very much like Perl, as people would pride themselves on how much, could they write the game of life in 30 characters of APL."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "APL has characters that mean summation and they have adverbs, they would have adjectives and these things called adverbs, which are like methods, like reduction, reduction would be an adverb on an ad operator, right?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So, but doing, using these tools you could construct and then you start to think at that level, you think in n dimensions is something I like to say, and you start to think differently about data at that point."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Now you're, it really helps."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Yeah, I mean, outside of programming, if you really internalize linear algebra as a course, I mean, it's philosophically allows you to think of the world differently."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "It's almost like liberating, you don't have to, you don't have to think about the individual numbers in the n dimensional array."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "You could think of it as an object in itself and all of a sudden this world can open up."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "You're saying MATLAB and APL were like the early C, I don't know if many languages got that right ever."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "No, no, no they didn't."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Even still, I would say."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "I mean, NumPy is an inheritor of the traditions that I would say APLJ was another version that was, what it did is not have the glyphs, just have short characters, but still a Latin keyboard could type them."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And then numeric inherited from that in terms of let's add arrays plus broadcasting plus methods, reduction, even some of the language like rank is a concept that was in Python and is still in Python for the number of dimensions, right?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "That's different than say the rank of a matrix which people think of as well."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So it came from that tradition, but NumPy is a very pragmatic, practical tool."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "NumPy inherited from numeric and we can get to where NumPy came from which is the current array, at least current as of 2015, 2017."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "Now there's a ton of them over the past two or three years."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "We can get into that too."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "So if we just linger on the early days of what was your favorite feature of Python?"}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Do you remember like what?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So it's so interesting to linger on like the, what really makes you connect with a language?"}, {"time": 1266, "text": "I'm not sure it's obvious to introspect that."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "No, it isn't."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And I've thought about that at some length."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I think definitely the fact that I could read it later, that I could use it productively without becoming an expert."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Other language I had to put more effort into."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "That's like an empirical observation."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Like you're not analyzing any one aspect of the language."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "It just seems time after time when you look back, it's somehow readable."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "It's somehow readable."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Then it was sort of, I could take executable English and translate it to Python more easily."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Like I didn't have to go, there was no translation layer."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "As an engineer or as a scientist, I could think about what I wanted to do."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And then the syntax wasn't that far behind it, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Now there are some warts there still."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "Like there's some areas where I'm like, ah, it'd be better if this were different or if this were different."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "Some of those things got added to the language too."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "I was really grateful for some of the early pioneers in the Python ecosystem back, because Python got written in 91."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "That's when the first version came out."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "But Guido was very open to users."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And one of the sets of users were people like Jim Huganen and David Asher and Paul Dubois and Conrad Hinson."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "These were people that were on the main list."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And they were just asking for things like, hey, we really should have complex numbers in this language."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So let's, you know, there's a J, there's a one J, right?"}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And the fact that they went the engineering route of J is interesting."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "I don't think that's entirely favoring engineers."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "I think it's because I is so often used as the index of a for loop."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So I think that's actually why."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Probably, I mean, there's a pragmatic aspect."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "But the fact that complex numbers were there, I love that."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "The fact that I could write in the array constructs and that reduction was there, very simple to write summations and broadcasting was there."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "I could do addition of whole arrays."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "So that was cool."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Those are some things I loved about it."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "I don't know what to start talking to you about because you've created so many incredible projects that basically changed the whole landscape of programming."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "But okay, let's start with, let's go chronologically with SciPy."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "You created SciPy over two decades ago now?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Yes, yes, I love to talk about SciPy."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "SciPy was really my baby."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "What was its goal?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "What is its goal?"}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Yeah, fantastic."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "So SciPy was effectively, here I am using Python to do stuff that I previously used MATLAB to use."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And I was using numeric, which is an array library that made a lot of it possible."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "But there's things that were missing."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Like I didn't have an ordinary differential equation solver I could just call, right?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "I didn't have integration."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Hey, I wanted to integrate this function."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Okay, well, I don't have just a function I can call to do that."}, {"time":

and have it tell me what the optimal value is."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Those are things I'm like, well, why don't we just write a library that adds these tools?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And I started to post on the mailing list and there'd previously been, people have discussed, I remember Conrad Henson saying, wouldn't it be great if we had this optimizer library or David Ashwood say this stuff."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And I'm a ambitious, ambitious is the wrong word, an eager and probably more time than sense."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I was a poor graduate student."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "My wife thinks I'm working on my PhD and I am, but part of the PhD that I loved was the fact that it's exploratory."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "You're not just taking orders, fulfilling a list of things to do, you're trying to figure out what to do."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And so I thought, well, I'm running tools for my own use and a PhD, so I'll just start this project."},

just a few things missing."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Like, oh, I need a reader to read DICOM files."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "I was in medical imaging and DICOM was a format that I want to be able to load that into Python."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "Okay, how do I write a reader for that?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So I wrote something called, it was an IO package, right?"}, {"time": 1491,

counting."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And so there's a tracking of reference counting you have to do manually."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "And if you don't, you have memory leaks."}, {"time": 1527,

about pointers and I have to think about stuff that is different."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "I have to kind of, you're like putting a new cartridge in your brain."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Like, okay, I'm thinking about MRI."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Now I'm thinking about programming."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "And there are distinct modules you end up having to think about."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "So it's harder."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And when I was just in Python, I could just think about MRI and high level writing, but I could do that."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And that kind of, I liked it."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "I found that to be enjoyable and fun."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And so I ended up, oh, well, let me just add a bunch of stuff to Python to do integration."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Well, and the cool thing is, is that the power of the internet, just looking around and I found, oh, there's this NetLive, which has hundreds of 4chan routines that people have written in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s in 4chan 77, fortunately, it wasn't 4chan 16."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "So it had been ported to 4chan 77."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And 4chan 77 is actually a really great language."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "4chan 90 probably is my favorite 4chan because it's also, it's got complex numbers, got arrays and it's pretty high level."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Now, the problem with it is you'd never want to write a program in 4chan 90 or 4chan 77, but it's totally fine to write a subroutine in, right?"}, {"time": 1594, "text": "And so, and then 4chan kind of got a little off course when they tried to compete with C++."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "But at the time, I just want libraries to do something like, oh, here's an ordinary differential equation."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "Here's integration."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Here's runge cut integration."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Already done."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "I don't have to think about that algorithm."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "I mean, you could, but it's nice to have somebody who's already done one and tested it."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And so I sort of started this journey in 98, really."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "If you look back at the mailing list, there's sort of this productive era of me writing an extension module to connect runge cut integration to Python and making an ordinary differential equation solver."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And then releasing that as a package."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "So we could call ODE pack, I think I called it then."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "Quad pack."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And then I just made these packages."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Eventually that became multipack because they're originally modular."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "You can install them separately."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "But a massive problem in Python was actually just getting your stuff installed."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "At the time, releasing software for me, like today it's people think, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Well, then it meant some poorly written webpage."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "I had some bad webpage up and I put a tarball, just a GZIP tarball of source code."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "That was the release."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "But okay, can we just stand that?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "Because the community aspect of creating the package and sharing that, that's rare."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "That, to have, to both have the, at that time, so like the raw."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Yeah, it was pretty early, yeah."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Oh, well, not rare."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "Maybe you can correct me on this, but it seems like in the scientific community, so many people, you were basically solving the problems you needed to solve to process the particular application, the data that you need."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "And to also have the mind that I'm going to make this usable for others, that's."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "I would say I was inspired."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I'd been inspired by Linux, been inspired by Linus and him making his code available."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And I was starting to use Linux at the time."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "And I went, this is cool."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "So I'd kind of been previously primed that way."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "And generally I was into science because I liked the sharing notion."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "I liked the idea of, hey, let's, if collectively we build knowledge and share it, we can all be better off."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "Okay, so you want to energize by that idea."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So I was energized by that idea already, right?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And I can't deny that I was."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "I'm sort of had this very, I liked that part of science, that part of sharing."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "And then all of a sudden, oh, wait, here's something."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And here's something I could do."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And then I slowly over years learned how to share better so that you could actually engage more people faster."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "One of the key things was actually giving people a binary they could install, right?"}, {"time": 1738, "text": "So that it wasn't just your source code, good luck."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Compile this and then."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "It's compiled, ready to install, just, you know."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "So in fact, a lot of the journey from 98, even through 2012 when I started Anaconda was about that."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "Like it's why, you know, it's really the key as to why a scientist with dreams of doing MRI research ended up starting a software company that installs software."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "I work with a few folks now that don't program like on the creative side and the video side, the audio side."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And because my whole life is running on scripts, I have to try to get them, I'm having all the task of teaching them how to do Python enough to run the scripts."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And so I've been actually facing this, whether it's Anaconda or some with the task of how do I minimally explain basically to my mom how to write a Python script."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "And it's an interesting challenge."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "I have to, it's a to do item for me to figure out like, what is the minimal amount of information I have to teach?"}, {"time": 1796, "text": "What are the tools you use that one, you enjoy it, two, you're effective at it."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And they're related, those are two related questions."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "And then the debugging, like the iterative process of running the script to figure out what the error is, maybe even for some people to do the fix yourself."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So do you compile it?"}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Do you, like how do you distribute that code to them?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And it's interesting because I think it's exactly what you're talking about."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "If you increase the circle of empathy, the circle of people that are able to use your programs, you increase it, it's like effectiveness and it's power."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And so you have to think, can I write scripts?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Can I write programs that can be used by medical engineers, by all kinds of people that don't know programming and actually maybe plant a seed, have them catch the bug of programming so that they start on a journey."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "That's a huge responsibility."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And ultimately it has to do with the Amazon one click buy."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Like how frictionless can you make the early steps?"}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Frictionless is actually really key."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "To go in any community is, any friction point, you're just gonna lose some people, right?"}, {"time": 1865, "text": "Now sometimes you may wanna intentionally do that."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "If you're early enough on, you need a lot of help."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "You need people who have the skills."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "You might actually, it's helpful."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "You don't necessarily have too many users as opposed to contributors if you're early on."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "Anyway, there's, SciFi started in 98, but it really emerged as this collection of modules that I was just putting on the net."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "People were downloading and I think I got 100 users, right?"}, {"time": 1891, "text": "By the end of that year."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "But the fact that I got 100 users and more than that, people started to email me with fixes."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And that was actually intoxicating, right?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "That was the, here I'm writing papers and I'm giving conferences and I get people to say hello, but yeah, good job."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "But mostly it was, you're viewed with, it's competitive, right?"}, {"time": 1911, "text": "You publish a paper and people are like, oh, it wasn't my paper."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "I was starting to see that sense of academic life where it was so much, I thought there was this cooperative effort, but it sounds like we're here just to one up each other."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "And it's not true across the board, but a lot of that's there."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "But here in this world, I was getting responses from people all over the world."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "I remember Pjaro Peterson in Estonia, right?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Was one of the first people."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And he sent me back this make file, cause the first thing it is, yeah, your build thing stinks and here's a better make file."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Now it was a complex make file."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "I don't think I never understood that make file actually, but it worked and it did a lot more."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And so I said, thanks, this is cool."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And that was my first kind of engagement with community development."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "But the process was, he sent me a patch file."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "I had to upload a new tar ball."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And I just found, I really love that."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "And the style back then was here's a mailing list."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "It's very, it wasn't as, it's certainly weren't the tools that are available today."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "It was very early on, but I really started to, that's the whole year."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "I think I did about seven packages that year, right?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And then by the end of the year, I collected them into a thing called multipack."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "So in 99, there was this thing called multipack."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And that's when a high school student, no, he was a high school student at the time, guy named Robert Kern, took that package and made a Windows installer, right?"}, {"time": 1989, "text": "And then of course, a massive increase of usage."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "So by the way, most of this development was under Linux."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "Yes, yes, it was on Linux."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "I was a Linux developer doing it on a Unix box."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "I mean, at the time I was actually getting into, I had a new hard drive, did some kernel

love that aspect of it."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "I was also in, at school, I was building a cluster."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "I took Mac computers and you put yellow dog Linux on them."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "At the Mayo Clinic, they were just, they had all these Macs that were older, they were just getting rid of."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "And so I kind of got permission to go grab them together."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "I put about 24 of them together in a cluster, in a cabinet, and put yellow dog Linux on them all."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And I wrote a C++ program to do MRI simulation."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "That was what I was doing at the same time for my day job, so to speak."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "So I was loving the whole process."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And the same time I was, oh, I need a ordinary differential equation."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "That's why ordinary differential equations were key was because that's the heart of a block equation for simulating MRI, is an ODE solver."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And so that's, but I actually did that, it just happened at the same time."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "That's why it was kind of what you're working on and what you're interested in, they're coinciding."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "I was definitely scratching my own itch in terms of building stuff."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "And which helped in the sense that I was using it for me, so at least I had one user."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "I had one person who was like, well, no, this is better."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "I like this interface better."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "And I had the experience of MATLAB to guide some of what those APIs might look like."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "But you're just doing yourself, you're building all this stuff."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "But with the Windows installer, it was the first time I realized, oh yeah, the binary installer really helps people."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And so that led to spending more time on that side of things."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "So around 2000, so I graduated my PhD in 2000, end of year, end of 2000."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "So 99 doing a lot of work there, 98 doing a lot of work there, 99 kind of spending more time on my PhD, helping people use the tools, thinking about what do I want to go from here."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "There was a company, there was a guy actually, Eric Jones and Travis Vought."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "They were two friends who founded a company called NTHOT."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "It's here in Austin, still here."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And they, Eric contacted me at the time when I was a graduate student still."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And he said, hey, why don't you come down?"},

done."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "He'd written some tools."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And then Piero Peterson had done F2Py."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "Let's come together and build, pull this all together and call it SciPy."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "So that's the origin of the SciPy brand."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "It came from multi pack and a whole bunch of modules I'd written, plus a few things from some other folks and then pulled together in a single installer."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "SciPy was really a distribution of Python masquerading as a library."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "How did you think about SciPy in context of Python, in context of Numeric, like what?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "So we saw SciPy as a way to make an R&D environment for Python, like use Python, depended on Numeric."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "So Numeric was the array library we depended on."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "And then from there, extend it with a bunch of modules that allowed for, and at the time, the original vision of SciPy was to have plotting, was to have the REPL environment and kind of really a whole data environment that you could then install and get going with."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And that was kind of the thinking."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "It didn't really evolve that way, right?"}, {"time": 2185, "text": "It sort of had a, for one, it's really hard to do massive scale projects with open source collectives."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "Actually, there's sort of an intrinsic cooperation limit as to which, too many cooks in the kitchen, you can do amazing infrastructure work."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "When it comes down to bringing it all together into a single deliverable, that actually requires a little more product management that is not, that doesn't really emerge from the same dynamic."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "So it struggled, struggled to get almost too many voices."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "It's hard to have everybody agree."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Consensus doesn't really work at that scale."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "You end up with politics, with the same kind of things that's happened in large organizations trying to decide what to do together."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So consensus building was challenging at scale as more people came in, right?"}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Early on, it's fine, because there's nobody there."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "So it works, but then as you get more successful and more people use it, all of a sudden, oh, there's this scale at which this doesn't work anymore and we have to come up with different approaches."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So Sidepy came out officially in 2001, was the first release, most of the time."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "I remember the days of getting that release ready."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "It was a Windows installer and there were bugs on how the Windows compiler handled complex numbers and you were chasing segmentation faults."},

had just gotten an offer."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "So he wondered if I wanted to come down and help him start that company with his friend."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "And at the time I was like, I was intrigued, but I was squaring a path, an academic path."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And I had just got an offer to go and teach at my alma mater."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "So I took that tenure track position."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "And Sidepy, and kind of, then I started to work on Sidepy as a professor too."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "So that's, I left, I've got the Mayo Clinic, graduated, wrote my thesis using Sidepy, wrote, you know, there's images that were created."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "Now the plotting tool I used was something from Yorick actually."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "It was a plotting, a PLT kind of a plotting language that I used."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "Yorick is a programming language?"}, {"time": 2303, "text": "It was a programming language, had a plotting tool, Dyslin, it had integration to Dyslin."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "I ended up using Dyslin plus some of the plotting from Yorick linked to from Python."}, {"time": 2313, "text":

the success of plotting came from John Hunter, who had a similar experience to my experience, my kind of maverick experience as a person just trying to get stuff done and kind of having more time than money maybe, right?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "And John Hunter created what?"}, {"time": 2335, "text": "MapPlotLib."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "He's the creator of MapPlotLib."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "Yeah, so John Hunter was, you know, he wasn't a student at the time, but he was an, he was working in Quant field and he said, we need better plotting."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "So he just went out and said, cool, I'll make a new project and we'll call it MapPlotLib."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And he released in 2001, about the same time that Sidepy came out and it was separate library, separate install, use numeric, Sidepy use numeric."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "And so Sidepy, you know, in 2001, we released Sidepy and then Endthought created a conference called Sidepy, which was brought people together to talk about the space."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "And that conference is still ongoing."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "It's one of the favorite conferences of a lot of people because it's, you know, it's changed over the years, but early on it was, you know, a collection of 50 people who care about, scientists mostly, you know, practicing scientists who want, who care about coding and doing it well and not using MATLAB."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "And I remember being driven by, you know, I liked MATLAB, but I didn't like the fact that, so I'm not opposed to proprietary

software."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "Right, and there's also culture around MATLAB as much, because I've talked to a few folks in, MathWorks creates MATLAB?"}, {"time": 2410, "text": "I mean, there's just a culture, they try really hard, but it just, there's this corporate IBM style culture that's like, or whatever."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "I don't want to say negative things about IBM or whatever, but there's a... No, it's really that connection."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "It's something I'm in the middle of right now is the business of open source."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And how do you connect the ethos of

the early days of me exploring this question."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "Cause I was writing SciPy, I mean, as an aside, I also had, so I had three kids at the time."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "I have six kids now."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "I got married early, wanted a family."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "I had three kids and I remember reading, I read Richard Stallman's post and I was a fan of

kids, right?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "That's just, don't, don't."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "That's his take on it."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "That was what he said in that moment, right?"}, {"time":

about this key part of life, it led me to go, there's a problem."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Like I should have learned this in fifth grade."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "I should have learned this in

know, what, would you wanna work on something to make this work?"}, {"time": 3128, "text": "And I said, yeah, I'm interested, but I'm going here, and I, you know, we'll see if I have time."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So in the meantime, while I was teaching and SciPy was emerging, and I had a student, I was constantly, while I was teaching, trying to figure a way to fund this stuff."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So I had a graduate student, my only graduate student, a Chinese fellow, Liu Hongze is his name, great guy."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "He wrote a bunch of stuff for iterative linear algebra, like got into writing some of the iterative linear algebra tools that are currently there in SciPy, and they've gotten better since, but this is in 2005, kept working on SciPy, but Perry has started working on a replacement to numeric called NumArray."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And in 2004, a package called ND Image, it was an image processing library that was written for NumArray, and it had in it a morphology tool."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "I don't know if you know what morphology is."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "It's open, dilations, closed, you know, there was sort of this, as a medical imaging student, I knew what it was, because it was used in segmentation a lot."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "And in fact, I'd wanted to do something like that in Python, in SciPy, but just had never gotten around to it."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "So when it came out, but it worked only on NumArray, and SciPy needed numeric, and so we effectively had the beginning of this split."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And numeric and NumArray didn't share data, they were just two, so you could have a gigabyte of numeric, NumArray data, and gigabyte of numeric data, and they wouldn't share it."},

like, oh man, this is not good, we're not cooperating now, we're sort of redoing each other's work, and we're just this young community."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "So that's what led me, even though I knew it was risky, because my, you know, I was on a tenure track position, 2004 I got reviewed."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "They said, hey, things are going okay, you're doing well, paper's coming out, but you're kind of spending a lot of time doing this open source stuff, maybe do a little less of that, and a little more of the paper writing and grant writing, which was naive, but it was definitely the thinking."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "It still goes on."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Still goes on."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "You're basically creating a thing which enables science in the 21st

3273, "text": "Yeah, it was very, they were very focused, and so, you know, good people, and I had a great time, I loved my time, I loved my teaching, I loved all the things I did there."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "The problem was, the split was happening in this community that I loved, right?"}, {"time": 3283, "text": "I saw people, and I went, oh my gosh, this is gonna be, this is not great, and so I happened, you know, fate, I had a class I had signed up for, it's a, I was trying to build an MRI system, so I had a kind of a radio, instead of a radio, a digital radio class, it was a digital MRI class."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "And I had people sign up, two people signed up, then they dropped, and so I had nobody in this class."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "So, and I didn't have any other courses to teach, and I thought, oh, I've got some time, and I'll just write, I'll just write a replace, a merger of Numerica Numeray."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "Like, I'll basically take the numeric code base at the features Numeray was adding, and then kind of come up with a single array library that everybody can use."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "So that's where NumPy came from, was my thinking, hey, I can do this, and who else is going to?"}, {"time": 3327, "text": "Because at that point, I'd been around the community long enough, and I'd written enough C code, I knew, I knew the structures,

Hinson, and myself."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "I got credit because I wrote this chapter, which is all the CAPI of Numerica, all the C stuff."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "So I said, I'm probably the one to do it, and nobody else is gonna do this."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "So it was sort of, out of a sense of duty and passion, knowing that, eh, I don't think my academic, I don't think the department here is gonna appreciate this, but it's the right thing to do."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "It was like."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Can we just link on that moment?"}, {"time": 3369, "text": "Because the importance of the way you thought and the action you took, I feel is understated and is rare and I would love to see so much more of it because what happens as the tools become more popular, there's a split that happens."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And it's a truly heroic and impactful action to in those early, in that early split, to step up and it's like great leaders throughout history,

"text": "It took about, it took four months to write the first version, then about 14 months to make it usable."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "But it was, it wasn't, it was that first four months of intense writing, coding, getting something out the door that worked that was, it was, it was definitely challenging."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "And then the big thing I did was create a new type object called D type."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "That was probably the contribution."}, {"time": 3598, "text": "And then the fact that I added broad, not just broadcasting, but advanced indexing so that you could do masked indexing and indirect indexing instead of just slicing."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "So for people who don't know, and maybe you can elaborate, NumPy, I guess the vision in the narrowest sense is to have this object that represents n dimensional arrays."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "And like at any level of abstraction you want, but basically it could be a black box that you can investigate in ways that you would naturally want to investigate such objects."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "So you could do math on it easily."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Math on it easily, yeah."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "So it had an associated library of math operations and effectively SciPy became an even larger operate set of math operations."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So the key for me was I was going to write NumPy and then move SciPy to depend on NumPy."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "In fact, early on, one of the initial proposals was that we would just write SciPy and it would have the numeric object inside of it."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "And it'd be SciPy.array or something."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "That turned out to be problematic because numeric already had a little mini library of linear algebra and some functions, and it had enough momentum, enough users that nobody wanted to, they wanted backward compatibility."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "One of the big challenges of NumPy was I had to be backward compatible with both numeric and NumArray in order to allow both of those communities to come together."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "There was a ton of work in creating that backward compatibility that also created echoes in today's object."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "Like some of the complexity in today's object is actually from that goal of backward compatibility to these other communities, which if you didn't have that, you'd do something different, which is instructive because a lot of things are there."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "You think, what is that there for?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "It's like, well, it's a remnant."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "It's an artifact of its historical existence."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "By the way, I love the empathy and the lack of ego behind that because I feel, you see that in the split in the JavaScript framework, for example, the arbitrary branching."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "I think in order to unite people, you have to kind of put your ego aside and truly listen to others."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "What do you love about NumArray?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "What do you love about Numeric?"}, {"time": 3726, "text": "Like actually get a sense, we were talking about languages earlier, sort of empathize to the culture, the people that love something about this particular API, some of the naming style or the actual usage patterns and truly understand them and so that you can create that same draw in the united thing."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "And you have to also have enough passion that you'll do it."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "It can't be just like a perfunctory, oh yes, I'll listen to you and then I'm not really that excited about it."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "So it really is an aspect, it's a philosophical, like there's a philia, there's a love of esteeming of others."}, {"time": 3764, "text": "It's actually at the heart of what, it's sort of a life philosophy for me, right?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "That I'm constantly pursuing and that helped, absolutely helped."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "Makes me wonder in a philosophical, like looking at human civilization as one object, it makes me wonder how we can copy and paste Travis's in this book."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "Well, some aspects, maybe."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "Some aspects, right, right, exactly."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "Well, it's a good question."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "How do we teach this?"}, {"time": 3788, "text": "How do we encourage it?"}, {"time": 3789, "text": "How do we lift it?"}, {"time": 3790, "text": "Because so much of the software world, it's giant communities, right?"}, {"time": 3795, "text": "But it seems like so much is moved by, like little individuals."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "You talk about like Linus Torvalds."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "It's like, could you have not, could you have had Linux without him?"}, {"time": 3806, "text": "Yeah, Guido and Python."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "Guido and Python."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "Well, the iPy community particularly, it's like I said, we wanted to build this big thing, but ultimately we didn't."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "What happened is we had Mavericks and champions like John Hunter who created Matplotlib."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "We had Fernando Perez who created iPython."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "And so we sort of inspired each other, but then it kind of, there's sort of a culture of this selfless giving, the stewardship mentality, as opposed to ownership mentality, but stewardship and community focused, community focused, but intentional work."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "Like not waiting for everybody else to do the work, but you're doing it for the benefit of others and not worried about what you're gonna get."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "You're not worried about the credit."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "You're not worried about what you're gonna get."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "You're worried about, I later realized that I have to worry a little about credit, not because I want the credit, because I want people to understand what led to the results."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "Like, I don't, it's not about me."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "It's I want to understand this is what led to the result."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "So let's like, I think doing, and this is what had no impact on the result."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Like let's promote, just like you said, I want to promote the attributes that help make us better off."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "How do we make more of West McKinney?"}, {"time": 3868, "text": "Like West McKinney was critical to the success of Python because of his creation of pandas, which is the roots of that were all the way back in numeric and num array and numpy, where numpy created an array of records."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "West started to use that almost like a data frame, except it's an array of records."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "And data frame, the challenge is, okay, if you want to augment it at another column, you have to insert, you have to do all this memory movement to insert a column."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "Whereas data frames became, oh, I'm going to have a loose collection of arrays."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "So it's a record of arrays that is a part of a data frame."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "And we thought about that back in the memory days, but West ended up doing the work to build it."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "And then also the operations that were relevant for data processing."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "What I noticed is just that each of these little things creates just another tick, another up."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "So numpy ultimately took a little while, about six months in, people started to join me, Francesc Altad, Robert Kern, Charles Harris."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "And these people are many of the unsung heroes, I would say."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "People who are, you know, they sometimes don't get the credit they deserve because they were critical both to support, like, you know, it's hard and you want, you need some support, people need support."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "And I needed just encouragement."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "And they were helping and encouraged by contributing."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And once, the big thing for me was when John Hunter, he had previously done kind of a simple thing called numerics to kind of, you know, between numeric and numerae, he had a little high level tool that would just select each one for matplotlib."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "In 2006, he finally said, we're gonna just make numpy the dependency of matplotlib."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "As soon as he did that, and I remember specifically when he did that, I said, okay, we've done it."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Like, that was when I knew we had to see success."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "Before then it was still unsure, but that kind of started a roller coaster."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And then 2006 to 2009."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And then I've been floored by what it's done."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Like, I knew it would help."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "I had no idea how much it would help."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "And it has to do with, again, the language thing."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "It just, people started to think in terms of numpy."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "And that opened up a whole new way of thinking."}, {"time": 3996, "text": "And part of the story that you kind of mentioned, but maybe you can elaborate, is it seems like at some point in the story, Python took over science and data science."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "And bigger than that, the scientific community started to think like programmers or started to utilize the tools of computers to do, like at a scale that wasn't done with Fortran."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "Like at this gigantic scale, they started to open in their heart."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "And then Python was the thing."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "I mean, there's a few other competitors, I guess, but Python, I think, really, really took over."},

huge fans and then some people that said no way, right?"}, {"time": 4054, "text": "So it was very, I was a polarizing figure in the department."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "It went all the way up to the university president."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "Ultimately, my department chair had the sway and they didn't say no."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "They said, come back in two years and do it again."},

work?"}, {"time": 4079, "text": "So I do have to give credit to that exploration of economics because that led me, oh, I had a lot of opinions."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "I was actually very libertarian at the time."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "And I still have some libertarian trends, but I'm more of a, I'm more of a collectivist libertarian."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "So you value broadly, philosophically freedom."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "I value broadly, philosophically freedom, but I also understand the power of communities, like the power of collective behavior."},

left academia."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "I said, no thanks, called my friend, Eric, here, who had, his company was going."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "I said, hey, could I join you and start this

Texas."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And in Texas is where I sort of, it's my entrepreneur world, right?"}, {"time": 4133, "text": "I left academia and went to entrepreneur world in 2007."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "So I moved here in 2007, kind of took a leap, knew nothing really about business, knew nothing about a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "There's, you know, for a long time, I've kept some connections to a lot of academics because I still value it."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "I still love the scientific tradition."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "I still value the essence and the soul and the heart of what is possible."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Don't like a lot of the administration and the kind of, we can go into detail about why and where and how this happens, what are some of the challenges."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "I don't know, but I'm with you."}, {"time": 4168, "text": "So I'm still affiliated with MIT."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "I still love MIT because

in the way of the magic."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "And I'm still have a lot of hope that that can change because I don't often see that particular type of magic elsewhere in the industry."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "So like we need that and we need that flame going."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "And it's the same thing as exactly as you said, it has the same kind of elements like the open source community does."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "And, but then if you, like the reason I stepped away, the reason I'm here, just like you did in Austin is like, if I wanna build one robot, I'll stay at MIT."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "But if I wanna build millions and make money enough to where I can explore the magic of that, then you can't."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "And I think that dance is... That translational dance has been lost a bit, right?"}, {"time": 4247, "text": "And there's a lot of reasons for that."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "I'm not, I'm certainly not an expert on this stuff."},

years."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "How do we connect capital markets and company?"}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Cause again, I fell in love with the notion of, oh, profit seeking on its own is not a bad thing."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "It's actually a coordination mechanism for allocating resources that, you know, in an emergent way, right?"}, {"time": 4278, "text": "That respects everybody's opinions, right?"}, {"time": 4280, "text": "So this is actually powerful."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "So I say all the time, when I make a company and we do something that makes profit, what we're saying is, hey, we're collecting of the world's resources and voluntarily people are asking us to do something that they like."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "And that's a huge deal."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "And so I really liked that energy."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "So that's what I came to do and to learn and to try to figure out."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And that's what I've been kind of stumbling through since for the past 14 years."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "And that's 2007."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "2007, yeah."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "And so you were still working at NoPi."},

out and just do the fundraising circuit the way it's traditionally done."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "So I wrote a book and I said, I'm gonna write a book and I'm gonna charge for it."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "It was called Guide to NoPi."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "And so ultimately NoPi became documentation driven development because I basically wrote the book and made sure the stuff worked or the book would work."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "So it really helped actually make NoPi become a thing."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So writing that book, and it's not a page turner."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Guide to NoPi is not a book you pick up and go, oh, this is great, over the fire."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "But it's where you could find the details, like how'd all this work."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And a lot of people love that book."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "And so a lot of people ended up, so I said, look, I need to, so I'm gonna charge for it."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And I got some flack for that."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "Not that much, just probably five angry messages, people yelling at me saying I was a bad guy for charging for this book."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "Was one of them Richard Stallman?"}, {"time": 4374, "text": "No, I haven't really had any interaction with him personally, like I said, but there were a few, but actually surprisingly not."},

source."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "So what I did, I did it in an interesting way."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "I said, well, kind of my ideas around IP law and stuff."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "I love the idea you can share something, you can spread it."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Like once it's, the fact that you have a thing and copying is free, but the creation is not free."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "So how do you fund the creation and allow the copying?"}, {"time": 4405, "text": "And in software, it's a little more complicated than that because creation is actually a continuous thing."},

the book and had this market determined price thing."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "I said, look, I need, I think I said 250,000."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "If I make 250,000 from this book, I'll make it free."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "So as soon as I get that much money, or I said five years, so there's a time limit."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "Like it's not forever."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "I released it on this."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "And it's actually interesting because one of the people who also thought that was interesting ended up being Chris White, who was the director of DARPA project that we got funding through at Anaconda."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "And the reason he even called us back is because he remembered my name from this book and he thought that was interesting."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "And so even though we hadn't gone to the demo days, we applied and the people said, yeah, nobody ever gets this without coming to the demo day first."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "This is the first time I've seen it."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "But it's because I knew, you know, Chris had done this and had this interaction."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "So it did have impact."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "I was actually really, really pleased by the result."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "I mean, I ended up in three years, I made 90,000."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "So sold 30,000 copies by myself."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "I just put it up on, you know, use PayPal and sold it."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And that was my first taste of kind of, okay, this can work to some degree."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "And I, you know, all over the world, right?"}, {"time": 4480, "text": "From Germany to Japan to, it was actually, it did work."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "And so I appreciated the fact that PayPal existed and I had a way to get the money, the distribution was simple."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "This is pre Amazon book stuff."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "So it was just publishing a website."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "It was the popularity of SciPy emerging and getting company usage."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I ended up not letting it go the five years and not trying to make the full amount because, you know, a year and a half later, I was at Enthought."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "I had left academia as an Enthought and I kind of had a full time job."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "And then actually what happened is the documentation people, there's a group that said, hey, we want to do documentation for SciPy as a collective."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "And they're essentially needing the stuff in the book, right?"}, {"time": 4518, "text": "And so they kind of ask, hey, could we just use the stuff in your book?"}, {"time": 4521, "text": "And at that point I said, yeah, I'll just open it up."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So that's, but it has served its purpose."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "And the money that I made actually funded my grad student."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Like it was actually, you know, I paid him 25,000 a year out of that money."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So the funny thing is if you do a very similar kind of experiment now with NumPy or something like it, you could probably make a lot more."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "It's probably true."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Because of the tooling and the community building."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "Like the, and social media, that there's just a virality to that kind of idea."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "There'd be things to do."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "I've thought about that."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "And really I thought about a couple of books or a couple of things that could be done there."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "And I just haven't, right?"}, {"time": 4558, "text": "Even, I tried to hire a ghostwriter this year too to see if that could help, but it didn't."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "But part of my problem is this, I've been so excited by a number of things that have stemmed from that."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "Like, so I came here, worked at Enthought for four years, graciously, Eric made me president."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "Then we started to work closely together."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "We actually helped him buy out his partner."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "It didn't end great."}, {"time": 4580, "text":

that Peter and I started Anaconda, right?"}, {"time": 4591, "text": "That was not, I mean, so there's two sides to that story."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "So I'm not gonna go into it, right?"},

building great companies."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "Somehow it's sad that when there's that kind of."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "And I hold him in esteem."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "I'm grateful for him."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "I think Enthought still exists."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "They're doing great work helping scientists."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "They still run the SciPy conference."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "They have an R&D platform they're selling now that's a tool that you can go get today, right?"}, {"time": 4630, "text": "So Enthought has played a role in the

you regret or not regret necessarily, but some things to think about."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "If you could go back and you could fix stuff about NumPy or both sort of in a personal level, but also

could play and grateful that things I did had an impact, but they only had the impact they had because the other people that came to the story."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "And so they were essential, but the way data types were handled, the way data types, we had array scalers, for example, that are really just a substitute for a type concept, right?"}, {"time": 4744, "text": "So we had array scalers or actual Python objects so that there's for every, for a 32 bit float or a 16 bit float or a 16 bit integer, Python doesn't have a natural, it's just one integer, there's one float."},

challenges, you wanna create new types."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "You wanna quaternion type or you wanna add a new posit type or you wanna, so it's hard."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "And now, if we had done that well, when Numba came on the scene where we could actually compile Python code, it would integrate with that type system much cleaner."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "And now all of a sudden you could do gradual typing more easily."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "You could actually have Python when you add Numba plus better typing, could actually be a, you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges."},

things, for example, is the GPU."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "Like all of a sudden GPUs start getting added and we don't have them in NumPy."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "Like NumPy should just work on

actually tricky, right?"}, {"time": 5495, "text": "And then willing to share, willing to share his ideas."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "So the other thing early on in 1998, I said, I wrote my first extension module."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "The reason I could is because he'd written this blog post on how to do reference counting, right?"}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And without it, I would have been lost, right?"}, {"time": 5510, "text": "But he was willing to at least try to write this post."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "And so he's been motivated early on with Python."}, {"time": 5516,

two, but the move from Python two to Python three is a little bit interesting because it took a very long time."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "It broke, you know, quite a small way backward compatibility,

three."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "Let's have that be, and it seems funny in retrospect because like, wait, Python three, that was in 2020, right?"}, {"time": 5905, "text": "When we finally ended the support for Python two or at least 2017."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "The reason it took a long time, a lot of time, I think it was because one of the things is there wasn't much to like about Python three."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "3.0, 3.1, it really wasn't until 3.3."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "Like I consider Python 3.3 to be Python 3.0."}, {"time": 5923, "text": "But it wasn't until Python 3.3 that I felt there's enough stuff in it to make it worth anybody using it, right?"}, {"time": 5929, "text": "And then 3.4 started to be, oh yeah, I want that."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "And then 3.5 as the matrix multiply operator, and now it's like, okay, we gotta use that."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "Plus the libraries that started leveraging some of the features of Python three."}, {"time":

them away from it."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "You can't just change the world on them."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "And Python three, you know, made some, I think it fixed some things Guido had always

sense, that's a bit of gratuitous change to the language."}, {"time": 5964, "text": "And you could argue, and people have, but one of the challenges was there wasn't enough features and too many just changes without features."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "And so the empathy for the end user as to why they would switch wasn't there."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "I think also it illustrated just the funding realities."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "Like Python wasn't funded."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "Like it was also a project with a bunch of volunteer labor, right?"}, {"time": 5988, "text": "It had more people, so more volunteer labor, but it was still, it was fun in the sense that at least Guido had a job."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "And I've learned some of the behind the scenes on that now since talking to people who have lived through it and maybe not on air, we can talk about some of that."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "But it's interesting to see, but Guido had a job, but his full time

think about that in terms of, I currently have an incubator for open source startups."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "Like what I'm trying to do right now is create the environment I wished had existed

that's what drives me still, is how do I make the world easier for the open source entrepreneur?"}, {"time": 6052, "text": "So let me stay, I mean, I could probably stay on NumPy for a long time, but this is fun question."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "So Andre Kapathy leads the Tesla Autopilot team, and he's also one of the most like legit programmers I know."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "It's like he

aspect of their like data loading, I think, by switching away from np.square root, so the NumPy's implementation of square root, to math.square root, and then somebody else commented that you can get even a much greater improvement by using the vanilla Python square root, which is like."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "And it's fascinating to me, I just wanted to."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "So that was some shade throwing at some."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "No, no, and yes, we're talking about."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "It's a good way to ask the trade off between usability and efficiency broadly in NumPy, but also on these specific weird quirks of like a single function."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "Yep, so on that point, if you use a NumPy math function on a scaler, it's gonna be slower than using a Python function on that scaler."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "But because the math object in NumPy is more complicated, because you can also call that math object on an array."}, {"time": 6156,

"text": "So yeah, if you're basically doing a list, if you run over a list, in fact, for problems that are less than 1,000, even maybe 10,000 is probably the, if you're going more than 10,000, that's where you definitely need to be using arrays."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "But if you're less than that, and for reading, if you're doing a reading process and essentially it's not compute bound, it's

Python."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "See, but also, and this is the side to the top, there's the fundamental questions when you look at the long arc of history, it's very possible that np.square root is much faster."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "So like in terms of like, don't worry about it, it's the evils of over optimization or whatever, all the different quotes around that, is sometimes obsessing about this particular little quark is not sufficient."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "For somebody like, if you're trying to optimize your path, I mean, I agree, premature optimization creates all kinds of

just attribute stuff to him, I don't know."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And it's fine because he's brilliant."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "So, no, I was a LaTeX user myself, and so I have a lot of

6257, "text": "There's a lot of little things like that, where people actually, if you understood it, you go, yeah, of course, that's the case."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "And the other part, the other part I didn't mention, and Numba was a thing we wrote early on, and I was really excited by Numba because it's something we wanted, it was a compiler for Python syntax, and I wanted it from the beginning of writing NumPy because of this function question, like taking, the power of arrays is really that you can write functions using all of it."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "It has implicit looping, right?"}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So you don't worry about, I write this n dimensional for loop with four loops, four, four statements."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "You just say, oh, big four dimensional array, I'm gonna do this operation, this plus, this minus, this reduction, and you get this, it's called vectorization in other areas, but you can basically think at a high level and get massive amounts of computation done with the added benefit of, oh, it can be paralyzed easily."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "It can be put in parallel."}, {"time": 6309, "text": "You don't have to think about that."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "In fact, it's worse to go decompose your, you write the for loops and then try to infer parallelism from for loops."}, {"time": 6316, "text": "That's actually a harder problem than to take the array problem and just automatically parallelize that problem."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "That's what, and so functions in NumPy are called universal functions, ufuncs."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "So square root is an example of a ufunk."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "There are others, sine, cosine, add, subtract."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "In fact, one of the first libraries to SciPy was something called Special where I added Bessel functions and all these special functions that come up in physics and I added them as ufuncs so they could work on arrays."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "So I understood ufuncs very, very well from day one inside of numeric."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "That was one of the things we tried to make better in NumPy was how do they work?"}, {"time": 6349, "text": "Can they do broadcasting?"}, {"time": 6350, "text": "What does broadcasting mean?"}, {"time": 6351, "text": "But one of the problems is, okay, what do I do with a Python scaler?"}, {"time": 6357, "text": "So what happens, the Python scaler gets broadcast to a zero dimensional array and then it goes through the whole same machinery as if it were a 10,000 dimensional array."}, {"time": 6365, "text": "And then it kind of unpacks the element and then does the addition."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "That's not to mention the function it calls in the case of square root is just the clib square root, right?"}, {"time": 6375, "text": "In some cases, like Python's power, there's some optimizations they're doing that could be faster than just calling this the clib square root."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "In the interpreter or in the?"}, {"time": 6385, "text": "No, in the C code, in the Python runtime."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "In the Python runtime, so they really optimize it and they have the freedom to do that because they don't have to worry about."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "It's just a scaler."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "Right, they don't have to worry about the fact that, oh, this could be an object with many pieces."}, {"time": 6399, "text": "The ufunc machine is also generic in sense that typecasting and broadcasting, broadcasting's idea of I'm gonna go, I have a zero dimensional array, I have a scaler with a four dimensional array and I add them."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "Oh, I have to kind of coerce the shape of this guy to make it work against the whole four dimensional array."}, {"time": 6416, "text": "So it's the idea of I can do a one dimensional array against a two dimensional array and have it make sense."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "Well, that's what NumPy does is it challenges you to reformulate, rethink your problem as a multi dimensional array problem versus move away from scalers completely."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "Right, exactly, exactly."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "In fact, that's where some of the edge cases boundaries are is that, well, they're still there and this is where array scalers are particular."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "So array scalers are particularly bad in the sense that they were written so that you could optimize the math on them, but that hasn't happened."}, {"time": 6449, "text": "And so their default is to coerce the array scaler to a zero dimensional array and then use the NumPy machinery."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "That's what, and you could specialize, but it doesn't happen all the time."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "So in fact, when we first wrote Numba, we do comparisons and say, look, it's 1000X speed up."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "We were lying a little bit in the sense that, well, first do the 40X slowdown of using the array scalers inside of a loop."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "Cause if you used to use Python scalers, you'd already be 10 times faster."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "But then we would get a hundred times faster over that using just compilation."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "But what we do is compile the loop from out of the interpreter to machine code."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "And then that's always been the power of Python is this extensibility so that you can, cause people say, oh, Python's so slow."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "Well, sure, if you do all your logic in the runtime of the Python interpreter, yeah."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "But the power is that you don't have to."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "You write all the logic, what you do in the high level is just high level logic."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "And the actual calls you're making could be on gigabyte arrays of data."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "And that's all done at compiled speeds."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And the fact that integration is one can happen, but two is separable."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "That's one of the, the language like Julia says, we're going to be all in one."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "You can do all of it together."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "And then there's, the jury's out, is that possible?"}, {"time": 6519, "text": "I tend to think that you're going to, there's separate concerns there."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "You want to precompile."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "In fact, generally you will want to precompile your, some of your loops."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "Like SciPy is a compilation step."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "To install SciPy, it takes about two hours."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "If you have many machines, maybe you can get it down to one hour."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "But to compile those libraries takes about, takes a while."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "You don't want to do that at runtime."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "You don't want to do that all the time."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "You want to have this precompiled binary available that you're then just linking into."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "So there's real questions about the whole source code."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Code is, running binary code is more than source code."}, {"time": 6551, "text": "It's creating object code, it's the linker, it's the loader, it's the how does that interpret it inside of virtual memory space."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "There's a lot of details there that actually I didn't understand for a long time until I read books on the topic."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "And it led to, the more you know, the better off you are and you can do more details, but sometimes it helps with abstractions too."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "Well, the problem, as we mentioned earlier with abstractions is you kind of sometimes assume that whoever implemented this thing had your case in mind and found the optimal solution."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "Or like you assume certain things."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of, Correct."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "One of the really powerful things to me early on, I mean, it sounds silly to say, but with Python, probably one of the reasons I fell in love with it is dictionaries."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "So obviously probably most languages have some mapping concept, but it felt like it was a first class citizen and it was just my brain was able to think in dictionaries."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "But then there's the thing that I guess I still use to this day is order dictionaries because that seems like a more natural way to construct dictionaries."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "And from a computer science perspective, the running time cost is not that significant, but there's a lot of things to understand about dictionaries that the abstraction kind of doesn't necessarily incentivize you to understand."}, {"time": 6637, "text": "Right, do you really understand the notion of a hash map and how the dictionary is implemented?"}, {"time": 6642, "text": "Dictionaries are a good example of an abstraction that's powerful."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "And I agree with you."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "I agree, I love dictionaries too."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "Took me a while to understand that once you do, you realize, oh, they're everywhere."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And Python uses them everywhere too."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "Like it's actually constructed, one of the foundational things is dictionaries and it does everything with dictionaries."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "So it is, it's powerful."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Order dictionaries came later, but it is very, very powerful."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "It took me a little while coming from just the array programming entirely to understand these other objects, like dictionaries and lists and tuples and binary trees."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "Like I said, I wasn't a computer scientist, I studied arrays first."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "And so I was very array centric."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "And you realize, oh, these others don't have purposes and value actually."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "There's a friendliness about, like one way to think about arrays is arrays are just like full of numbers, but to make them accessible to humans and make them less error prone to human users, sometimes you want to attach names, human interpretable names that are sticky to those arrays."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "So that's how you start to think about dictionaries is you start to convert numbers into something that's human interpretable."}, {"time": 6712, "text": "And that's actually the tension I've had with NumPy because I've built so much tooling around human interpretability and also protecting me from a year later not making the mistakes by being, I wanted to force myself to use English versus numbers."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "Yes, so there's a project called Labeled Arrays."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "Like very early it was recognized that, oh, we're indexing NumPy with just numbers, all the columns and particularly the dimensions."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "I mean, if you have an image, you don't necessarily need to label each column or row, but if you have a lot of images or you have another dimension, you'd at least like to label the dimension as this is X, this is Y, this is Z, or this is give us some human meaning or some domain specific meaning."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "That was one of the impetuses for Pandas actually was just, oh, we do need to label these things."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "And Label Array was an attempt to add that like a lighter weight version of that."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "And there's been, like, that's an example of something I think NumPy could add, could be added to NumPy, but one of the challenges again, how do you fund this?"}, {"time": 6775, "text": "Like I said, one of the tragedies I think is that, so I never had the chance to, I was never paid to work on NumPy, right?"}, {"time": 6782, "text": "So I've always just done it in my spare time, always taken from one thing, taken from another thing to do it."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "And at the time, I mean, today, it would be the wrong day and today, like paying me to work on NumPy now would not be a good use of effort, but we are finally at Quansight Labs, I'm actually paying people to work on NumPy and SciPy, which is I'm thrilled with, I'm excited by."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "I've wanted to do that."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "That's what I always wanted to do from day one."}, {"time": 6804, "text": "It just took me a while to figure out a mechanism to do that."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "Even like in the university setting, respecting that, like pushing students, young minds and young graduate students to contribute and then figuring out financial mechanisms that enable them to contribute and then sort of reward them for their innovative scientific journey, that would be nice."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "But then also just a better allocation of resources."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "It's 20 year anniversary since 9.11 and I was just looking, we spent over $6 trillion in the Middle East after 9.11 in the various efforts there."},

about open source is it's global, it's multinational."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "Like there aren't national boundaries."}, {"time": 6909, "text": "One of the challenges with business and open source is the fact that, well, business is national."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "Like businesses are entities that are recognized in legal jurisdictions, right?"}, {"time": 6916, "text": "And have laws that

{"time": 7012, "text": "So you mentioned the project of Numba, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "So from the early days, there was kind of a pushback on Python that it's not fast."},

the reality was people would write high level coding and use compiled code, but there's still user stories, use cases, where you want to write Python, but then have it still be fast."}, {"time": 7048,

know, put it in an array."}, {"time": 7057, "text": "And often that can make a memory trade off."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "Like quite often you can do it, but then you make maybe use more memory because you have to build this array of data that you don't necessarily need all the time."}, {"time": 7066, "text": "So Numba was, it started from a desire to have kind of a vectorized that worked."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "A vectorized was a tool in NumPy, it was released."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "You give it a Python function and it gave you a universal function, a ufunc that would work on arrays."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "So you get the function that just worked on a scaler."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "Like you could make a, like the classic case was a simple function that an

"text": "The challenge is you don't want that loop peg one in Python."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "So you want a compiled version of that, but the ufunc, the vectorized in NumPy would just give you a Python function."}, {"time": 7104, "text": "So it would take the array of numbers and at every call do a loop back into Python."}, {"time": 7109, "text": "So it was very slow."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "It gave you the appearance of a ufunc, but it was very slow."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "So I always wanted a vectorized that would take that Python scaler function and produce a ufunc working on binary native code."}, {"time": 7119, "text": "So in fact, I had somebody work on that with PyPy and see if PyPy could be used to produce a ufunc like that early on in 2009 or something like that, 2010."}, {"time": 7130, "text": "They didn't work that well."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "It was kind of pretty bulky."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "But in 2012, Peter and I had just started Anaconda."},

{"time": 7149, "text": "Oh, that's a good line."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "But, so we were trying to do something."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "We were trying to change the world."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Peter and I are super ambitious."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "We wanted to make array computing and we had ideas for really what's still, it's still the energy right now."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "How do you do at scale data science?"}, {"time": 7163, "text": "And we had a bunch of ideas there, but one of them, I had just talked to people about LLVM and I was like, there's a way to do this."}, {"time": 7170, "text": "I just, I went, I heard about my friend Dave Beasley at a compiler course."}, {"time": 7173, "text": "So I was looking at compilers like, and I realized, oh, this is what you do."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And so I wrote a version of Numba that just basically mapped Python bytecode to LLVM."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "Right, so, and the first version is like, this works and it produces code that's fast."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "This is cool for, you know, obviously a reduced subset of Python."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "I didn't support all the Python language."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "There had been efforts to speed up Python in the past, but those efforts were, I would say, not from the array computing perspective, not from the perspective of wanting to produce a vectorized improvement."}, {"time": 7203, "text": "They were from the perspective of speeding up the runtime of Python, which is fundamentally hard because Python allows for some constructs that aren't, you can't speed up."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "Like it's this generic, you know, when it does this variable."}, {"time": 7215, "text": "So I, from the start, did not try to replicate Python's semantics entirely."}, {"time": 7220, "text": "I said, I'm gonna take a subset of the Python syntax and let people write syntax in Python, but it's kind of a new language really."}, {"time": 7227, "text": "So it's almost like four loops, like focusing on four loops."}, {"time": 7230, "text": "Four loops, scalar arithmetic, you know, typed, you know, really typed language, a typed subset."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "That was the key."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "So, but we wanted to add inference of types."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "So you didn't have to spell all the types out because when you call a function, so Python is typed, it's just dynamically typed."}, {"time": 7248, "text": "So you don't tell it what the types are, but when it runs, every time an object runs, there's a type for the variables."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "You know what it is."}, {"time": 7254, "text": "And so that was the design goals of Numba were to make it possible to write functions that could be compiled and have them used for NumPy arrays."}, {"time": 7263, "text": "Like they needed to support NumPy arrays."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "And so how does it work?"}, {"time": 7267, "text": "Do you add a comment within Python that tells it to do, like how do you help out the compiler?"}, {"time": 7271, "text": "Yeah, so there isn't much actually."}, {"time": 7275, "text": "You don't, it's kind of magical in the sense that it just looks at the type of the objects and then it's typed inference to determine any other variables it needs."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "And then it was also, because we had a use case that could work early."}, {"time": 7288, "text": "Like one of the challenges of any kind of new development is if you have something that to make it work, it was gonna take you a long time, it's really hard to get out off the ground."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "If you have a project where there's some incremental story, it can start working today and solve a problem, then you can start getting it out there, getting feedback."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "Because Numba today, now Numba is nine years old today, the first two, three versions were not great, right?"}, {"time": 7312, "text": "But they solved a problem and some people could try it and we could get some feedback on it."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "Not great in that it was very focused."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "Very fragile, the subset it would actually compile was small and so if you wrote Python code and said, so the way it worked is you write a function and you say at JIT, use decorators."}, {"time": 7329, "text": "So decorators, just these little constructs let you decorate code with an at and then a name."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "The at JIT would take your Python function and actually just compile it and replace the Python function with another function that interacts with this compiled function."}, {"time": 7344, "text": "And it would just do that and we went from Python bytecode then we went to AST."}, {"time": 7349, "text": "I mean, writing compilers actually, I learned a lot about why computer science is taught the way it is because compilers can be hard to write."}, {"time": 7356, "text": "They use tree structures, they use all the concepts of computer science that are needed."}, {"time": 7360, "text": "It's actually hard to, it's easy to write a compiler and then have it be spaghetti code."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "Like the passes become challenging and we ended up with three versions of Numba, right?"}, {"time": 7369, "text": "Numba got written three times."}, {"time": 7371, "text": "What programming language is Numba written in?"}, {"time": 7375, "text": "Python."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "Wait, okay."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "Yeah, Python."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "Yeah, so Python, but then the whole goal of Numba is to translate Python bytecode to LLVM."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "And so LLVM actually does the code generation."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "In fact, a lot of times they'd say, yeah, it's super easy to write a compiler if you're not writing the parser nor the code generator."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "So for people who don't know, LLVM is a compiler itself."}, {"time": 7399, "text": "So your compiler."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "Yeah, it's really badly named low level virtual machine, which that part of it is not used."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "It's really low level."}, {"time": 7405, "text": "Chris, he doesn't mean that."}, {"time": 7406, "text": "Yeah, love Chris."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "But the name makes you imply that the virtual machine is what it's all about."}, {"time": 7412, "text": "It's actually the IR and the library, the code generation."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "That's the real beauty of it."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "The fact that, what I love about LLVM was the fact that it was a plateau you could collaborate on."}, {"time": 7424, "text": "Instead of the internals of GCC or the internals of the Intel compiler, or like how do I extend that?"}, {"time": 7429, "text": "And it was a place we could collaborate."}, {"time": 7431, "text": "And we were early."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "I mean, people had started before."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "It's a slow compiler."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "Like it's not a fast compiler."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So for some kind of JITs, like JITs are common in language because one, every browser has a JavaScript JIT."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "It does real time compilation of the JavaScript to machine code."}, {"time": 7449, "text": "For people who don't know, JIT is just in time compilation."}, {"time": 7452, "text": "Yeah, just in time compilation."}, {"time": 7453, "text": "They're actually really sophisticated."}, {"time": 7454, "text": "In fact, I got jealous of how much effort was put into the JavaScript JITs."}, {"time": 7458, "text": "Yes, well, it's kind of incredible what they've done."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "Yes, I completely agree."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "I'm very impressed."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "But you know, Numba was an effort to make that happen with Python."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And so we used some of the money we raised from Anaconda to do it."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "And then we also applied for this DARPA grant and used some of that money to continue the development."}, {"time": 7476, "text": "And then we used proceeds from service projects we would do."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "We get consulting projects that we would then use some of the profits to invest in Numba."}, {"time": 7485, "text": "So we ended up with a team of two or three people working on Numba."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "It was a fits and starts, right?"}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And ultimately, the fact that we had a commercial version of it also we were writing."}, {"time": 7494, "text": "So part of the way I was trying to fund Numba, say, well, let's do the free Numba and then we'll have a commercial version of Numba called Numba Pro."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "And what Numba Pro did is it targeted GPUs."}, {"time": 7503, "text": "So we had the very first CUDA JIT and the very first at JIT compiler that in 2012 for 13, you could run not just a view func on CPU, but a view func on GPUs."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "And it would automatically paralyze it and get 1000X speed on it."}, {"time": 7518, "text": "And that's an interesting funding mechanism because large companies or larger companies care about speed in just this way."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So it's exactly a really good way."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "Yeah, there's been a couple of things you know people will pay for."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "One, they'll pay for really good user interfaces, right?"}, {"time": 7537, "text": "And so I'm always looking for what are the things people will pay for that you could actually adapt to the open source infrastructure?"}, {"time": 7543, "text": "One is definitely user interfaces."}, {"time": 7545, "text": "The second is speed, like a better runtime, faster runtime."}, {"time": 7549, "text": "And then when you say people, you mean like a small number of people pay a lot of money, but then there's also this other mechanism that."}, {"time": 7555, "text": "A ton of people pay."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "First, I gotta, we mentioned Anaconda, we mentioned friends, family, and fools."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "So Anaconda is yet another."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "So there's a company, but there's also a project."}, {"time": 7569, "text": "That is exceptionally impactful in terms of, for many reasons, but one of which is bringing a lot more people into the community of folks who use Python."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "So what is Anaconda?"}, {"time": 7586, "text": "What is its goals?"}, {"time": 7588, "text": "Maybe what is Conda versus Anaconda?"}, {"time": 7591, "text": "Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit of the history of that."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "Cause Anaconda, we wanted to do, we wanted to scale Python."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "Cause we, you know, that was the goal."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "Peter and I had the goal of when we started Anaconda, we actually started as Continuum Analytics was the name of the company that started."}, {"time": 7604, "text": "It got renamed Anaconda in 2015."}, {"time": 7607, "text": "But we said, we want to scale analytics."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "NumPy is great, Pandas is emerging, but these need to run at scale with lots of machines."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "The other thing we wanted to do was make user interfaces that were web."}, {"time": 7619, "text": "We wanted to make sure the web did not pass by the Python community."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "That we had ways to translate your data science to the web."}, {"time": 7626, "text": "So those are the two kind of technical areas."}, {"time": 7627, "text": "We thought, oh, we'll build products in this space."}, {"time": 7629, "text": "And that was the idea."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "Very quickly in, but of course, the thing I knew how to do was to do consulting to make money and to make sure my family and friends and fools that had invested didn't lose their money."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "So it's a little different than if you take money from a venture fund."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "If you take money from a venture fund, the venture fund, they want you to go big or go home."}, {"time": 7647, "text": "And they're kind of like expecting nine out of 10 to fail or 99 out of 100 to fail."}, {"time": 7653, "text": "I was, I was owed a barbell strategy."}, {"time": 7655, "text": "I was like, I can't fail."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "I mean, I may not do super well, but I cannot lose their money."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "So I'm going to do something I know can return a profit, but I want to have exposure to an upside."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "So that's what happened at Anaconda."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "We didn't, there was lots of things we did not well in terms of that structure."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "And I've learned from since and how to do it better."}, {"time": 7673, "text": "But we've, we did a really good job of kind of attracting the interest around the area to get good people working and then get funnel some money on some interesting projects."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "Super excited about what came out of our energy there."}, {"time": 7685, "text": "Like a lot did."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "So what are some of the interesting projects?"}, {"time": 7688, "text": "So Dask, Numba, Bokeh, Conda."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "There was a data shader, Panel, Holoviz."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "These are all tools that are extremely relevant in terms of helping you build applications, build tools, build, you know, faster code."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "There's a couple I'm forgetting."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "Oh, JupyterLab, JupyterLab came out of this too."}, {"time": 7710, "text": "Okay, so Bokeh does plotting?"}, {"time": 7713, "text": "Bokeh does plotting."}, {"time": 7714, "text": "So Bokeh was one of the foundational things to say, I want to do plot in Python, but have the things show up in a web."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "Right, that's right."}, {"time": 7720, "text": "And plotting to me still, with all due respect to Matplotlib and Bokeh, it feels like still an unsolved problem, not a solved problem."}, {"time": 7730, "text": "It is, it's a big problem."}, {"time": 7732, "text": "Right, because you're, I mean, I don't know, it's visualization broadly, right?"}, {"time": 7738, "text": "I think we've got a pretty good API story around certain use cases of plotting."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "But there's a difference between static plots versus interactive plots versus I'm an end user, I just want to write a simple, for Pandas started the idea of here's a data frame on a dot plot, I'm just going to attach plot as a method to my object, which was a little bit controversial, right?"}, {"time": 7758, "text": "But works pretty well, actually, because there's a lot less you have to pass in, right?"}, {"time": 7763, "text": "You can just say, here's my object, you know what you are, you tell the visualization what to do."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "So that, and there's things like that that have not been super well developed entirely, but Bokeh was focused on interactive plotting."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "So you could, it's a short path between interactive plotting and application, dashboard application."}, {"time": 7782, "text": "And there's some incredible work that got done there, right?"}, {"time": 7784, "text": "And it was a hard project, because then you're basically doing JavaScript and Python."}, {"time": 7789, "text": "So we wanted to tackle some of these hard problems and try to just go after them."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "We got some DARPA funding to help, and it was super helpful, funny story there, we actually did two DARPA proposals, but one we were five minutes late for."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "And DARPA has a very strict cutoff window."}, {"time": 7803, "text": "And so I, we had two proposals, one for the Bokeh and one for actually Numba and the other work."}, {"time": 7809, "text": "Which one were you late for?"}, {"time": 7810, "text": "The Foundation on Numerical Work."}, {"time": 7812, "text": "So Bokeh got funded."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "Fortunately, Chris let us use some of the money to fund still some of the other foundational work, but it wasn't as, yeah, his hands were tired, he couldn't do anything about it."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "That was a whole interesting story."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "So one of the incredible projects that you worked on is Conda."}, {"time": 7830, "text": "So what is Conda?"}, {"time": 7830, "text": "So how that came about, yeah, Conda, it was early on, like I said, with SciPy."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "SciPy was a distribution mass generation library."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "And he said, he heard me talking about compiler issues and trying to get the stuff shipped and the fact that people can use your libraries if they have it."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "So for a long time, we'd understood the packaging problem in Python."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "And one of the first things he did at Conda Analytics became Anaconda was organize the Pi data ecosystem in conjunction with NumFocus."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "We actually started NumFocus with some other folks in the community the same year we started Anaconda."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "I said, we're gonna build a corporation, but we're also gonna reify the community aspect and build a nonprofit."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "So we did both of those."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "Can we pause real quick and can you say what is PyPy, the Python package index, like this whole story of packaging in Python?"}, {"time": 7879, "text": "Yeah, that's what I'm gonna get to actually."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "This is exactly the journey I'm on."}, {"time": 7882, "text": "It's to sort of explain packaging in Python."}, {"time": 7884, "text": "I think it's best expressed to the conversation I had with Guido at a conference, where I said, so packaging is kind of a problem."}, {"time": 7891, "text": "And Guido said, I don't ever care about packaging."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "I don't use it."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "I don't install new libraries."},

different development packaging managers?"}, {"time": 7916, "text": "Should you have a package manager per language?"}, {"time": 7918, "text": "Is that really the right approach?"}, {"time": 7919, "text": "I think there are some answers of it is appropriate to have development tools."}, {"time": 7924, "text": "And there's an aspect of a development tool that is related to packaging."}, {"time": 7927, "text": "And every language should have some story there to help their developers create."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "So you should have language specific development tools."}, {"time": 7934,

use Python to do something."}, {"time": 7958, "text": "How do I get this installed?"}, {"time": 7959, "text": "It was always focused on that."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "So it didn't have a develop."},

right, you said, okay, you said to do this ourselves."}, {"time": 8019, "text": "So at the same time, people did start to work on the packaging story in Python."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "It just took a little longer."}, {"time": 8025, "text": "So in 2012, kind of motivated by our training courses we were teaching, like very similar to what you just mentioned about your mother."}, {"time": 8032,

could get it."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "And then we had constantly thought about, well, do we just leverage RPM?"}, {"time": 8079, "text": "But the challenge had always been, we want a package

go multiple operating systems, multiple and programming language independent."}, {"time": 8119, "text": "Because even Python, and particularly what was important was SciPy has a bunch of Fortran in

2012."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "First version of Conda came out in early 2013, summer of 2013, and it was a package manager."}, {"time": 8147, "text": "So you could say, Conda install scikit

to you earlier about SciPy being too big to be a single library."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "Well, what the community had done is said, let's make scikits."}, {"time": 8164, "text": "And there's scikit image, there's scikit learn, there's a lot of scikits."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "And it was a fantastic move that the community did."}, {"time": 8170, "text": "I didn't do it."}, {"time": 8171,

was like, that's gotta be simpler."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "That's scikit learn, we gotta make that smaller."}, {"time": 8179, "text": "I don't like typing all this stuff from imports."}, {"time": 8181, "text": "So I was kind of a pressure that way, but I love the energy and love the fact that they went out and they did it, and DOS people, Jared Millman, and then of course, Gael, and there's people I'm not even naming."}, {"time": 8191, "text": "Scikit learn really emerged as a fantastic project."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "And the documentation around that is also incredible."}, {"time": 8196, "text": "And the documentation was incredible, exactly."}, {"time": 8197, "text": "I don't know who did that, but they did a great job."}, {"time": 8200, "text": "A lot of people in Inria, a lot of European contributors."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "There's some Andreas in the US."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "There's a lot of just people I just adore, I think are amazing people."}, {"time": 8211, "text": "Awesome use of SciPy, right?"}, {"time": 8212, "text": "I love the fact that they were using SciPy effectively to do something I love, which is machine learning, but couldn't install it."}, {"time": 8218, "text": "Because there's so many pieces involved."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "So many dependencies, right?"}, {"time": 8222, "text": "So our use case of Conda was Conda install scikit learn."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "Right, and it was the best way to install scikit learn in 2013 to really 2018, 17, 18, PIP finally caught up."}, {"time": 8234, "text": "I still think it's you should Conda install scikit learn for the PIP install scikit learn, but you can PIP install scikit learn."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "The issue is the package they created was wheels and PIP does not handle the multi vendor approach."}, {"time": 8244, "text": "They don't handle the fact you have C++ libraries you're depending on."}, {"time": 8247, "text": "They just stop at the Python boundary."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "And so what you have to do in the wheel world is you have to vendor."}, {"time": 8253, "text": "You have to take all of the binary and vendor it."}, {"time": 8255, "text": "Now, if your change happens in underlying dependency, you have to redo the whole wheel."}, {"time": 8260, "text": "So TensorFlow, as you know, you should not PIP install TensorFlow."}, {"time": 8264,

Conda is like 100 X to one."}, {"time": 8283, "text": "So it just has to do with the."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "And that was increasing."}, {"time": 8285, "text": "It wasn't true early because PIP didn't exist."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "Like Conda came first."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "So but that's the problem."}, {"time": 8290, "text": "Like Conda came first, but that's like the long tail of the internet documentation user generated."}, {"time": 8295, "text": "So that like you think, how do I install Google?"}, {"time": 8299, "text": "How do I install TensorFlow?"}, {"time": 8300, "text": "You're just not gonna see Conda in that first page."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "Not today, you would have in 2016, 2017."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "And it's sad because Conda solves a lot of usability issues."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "Like for especially super challenging thing."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "One of the big pain points for me was just on the computer vision side, OpenCV installation."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "Perfect example."}, {"time": 8325, "text": "I think Conda, I don't know if Conda solved that one."}, {"time": 8327, "text": "Conda has an OpenCV package."}, {"time": 8329, "text": "I certainly know PIP has not solved."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "I mean, there's complexities there because."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "I should probably know a good answer for this, but if you compile OpenCV with certain dependencies, you'll be able to do certain things."}, {"time": 8347, "text": "So there's this kind of flexibility of what you, like what options you compile with."}, {"time": 8353, "text": "And I don't think it's trivial to do that with Conda or."}, {"time": 8357, "text": "So Conda has a notion of variance of a package."}, {"time": 8360, "text": "You can actually have different compilation versions of a package."}, {"time": 8363, "text": "So not just the version is different, but oh, this is compiled with these optimizations on."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "So Conda does have an answer."}, {"time": 8368, "text": "Has those flavors."}, {"time": 8368, "text": "Has flavors, basically."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "Well, PIP, as far as I know, does not have flavors."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "PIP generally hasn't thought deeply about the binary dependency problem, right?"}, {"time": 8378, "text": "And that's why fundamentally it doesn't work for the SciPy ecosystem."}, {"time": 8383, "text": "It barely, you can sort of paper over it and duct tape and it kind of works until it doesn't and it falls apart entirely."}, {"time": 8389, "text": "So it's been a mixed bag."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "Like, and I've been having lots of conversations with people over the years because again, it's an area where if you understand some things, but not all the things, but they've done a great job of community appeal."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "This is an area where I think Anaconda as a company needed to do some things in order to make Conda more community centric, right?"}, {"time": 8410, "text": "And this is a, I talk about this all the time."}, {"time": 8413, "text": "There's a balance between you have every project starts with what I called company backed open source."}, {"time": 8418, "text": "Even if the company is yourself, it's just one person, just doing business as."}, {"time": 8423, "text": "But ultimately for products to succeed virally and become massive influencers, they have to create, they have to get community people on board."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "They have to get other people on board."}, {"time": 8432, "text": "So it has to become community driven."}, {"time": 8433, "text": "And a big part of that is engagement with those people."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "Empowering people, governance around it."}, {"time": 8438, "text": "And what happened with Conda in the early days, PIP emerged and we did do some good things."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "Conda Forge, Conda Forge community is sort of the community recipe creation community."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "But Conda itself, I still believe, and Peter is CEO of Anaconda, he's my co founder."}, {"time": 8455, "text": "I ran Anaconda until 2017, 2018."}, {"time": 8458, "text": "Is Peter still Anaconda?"}, {"time": 8459, "text": "Peter's still Anaconda, right?"}, {"time": 8460, "text": "And we're still great friends."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "We talk all the time."}, {"time": 8462, "text": "I love him to death."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "There's a long story there about like why and how and we can cover in some other podcast perhaps."}, {"time": 8469, "text": "It's sort of a more, maybe a more business focused one."}, {"time": 8471, "text": "But this is one area where I think Conda should be more community driven."}, {"time": 8477, "text": "Like he should be pushing more to get more community contributors to Conda and let the, Anaconda shouldn't be fighting this battle."}, {"time": 8487, "text": "It's actually, it's really a developers."}, {"time": 8488, "text": "Like you said, like help the developers and then they'll actually move us the right direction."}, {"time": 8492, "text": "Well, that was the problem I have is many of the cool kids I know don't use Conda."}, {"time": 8496, "text": "And that to me is confusing."}, {"time": 8498, "text": "It is confusing."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "It's really a matter of, Conda has some challenges."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "First of all, Conda still needs to be improved."}, {"time": 8504, "text": "There's lots of improvements to be made."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "And it's that aspect of wait, who's doing this?"}, {"time": 8507, "text": "And the fact that then the Pi PA really stepped up."}, {"time": 8510, "text": "Like they were not solving the problem at all."}, {"time": 8513, "text": "And now they kind of got to where they're solving it for the most part."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "And then effectively you could get, like Conda solved a problem that was there."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "And it still does."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "It's still, you know, there's still great things it can do."}, {"time": 8523, "text": "But, and we still use it all the time at one site and with other clients, but with, but you can kind of do similar things with PIP and Docker."}, {"time": 8533, "text": "So especially with the web development community, that part of it, again, is this is the, there's a lot of different kinds of developers in the Python ecosystem."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "And there's still a lack of some clear understanding."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "I go to the Python conference all the time and then there's only a few people in the Pi PA who get it."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "And then others who are just massively trumpeting the power of PIP, but just do not understand the problem."}, {"time": 8553, "text": "So one of the obvious things to me from a mom, from a non programmer perspective, is the across operating system usability."}, {"time": 8561, "text": "That's much more natural."}, {"time": 8562, "text": "So there's people that use Windows and just, it seems much easier to recommend Conda there, but then it, you should also recommend it across the board."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "So I'll definitely sort of."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "But what I recommend now is a hybrid."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "I mean, I have no problem."}, {"time": 8577, "text": "Is it possible to use?"}, {"time": 8577, "text": "Oh, it is."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "But like build the environment with PIP, with Conda, build an environment with Conda and then PIP install on top of that."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "Be careful about PIP installing OpenCV or TensorFlow or because if somebody's allowed that, it's gonna be most surely done in a way that can't be updated that easily."}, {"time": 8595, "text": "So install like the big packages, the infrastructure with Conda and then the weirdos."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "That like the weird like implementation for some."}, {"time": 8604, "text": "I had a, there's a cool library I used that based on your location and time of day and date tells you the exact position of the sun relative to the earth."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "And it's just like a simple library, but it's very precise."}, {"time": 8621, "text": "And I was like, all right."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "But that was, that was, and it's like PIP."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "Well, the thing they did really well is Python developers who wanna get their stuff published, you have to have a PIP recipe."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "I mean, even if it's, you know, the challenge is, and there's a key thing that needs to be added to PIP, just simply add to PIP the ability to defer to a system package manager."}, {"time": 8643, "text": "Like, cause it's, you know, recognize you're not gonna solve all the dependency problem."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "So let like give up and allow the system package to work."}, {"time": 8652, "text": "That way Anaconda is installed and it has PIP."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "It would default to Conda to install stuff, but Red Hat RPM would default to RPM to install some more things."}, {"time": 8660, "text": "Like that's the, that's a key, not difficult, but somewhat work, some work feature needs to be added."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "That's an example of something like, I've known we need to do it."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "I mean, it's where I wish I had more money."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "I wish I was more successful in the business side, trying to get there, but I wish my, you know, my family, friends and full community that I know."}, {"time": 8677, "text": "Was larger."}, {"time": 8678, "text": "Was larger and had more money."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "Cause I know tons of things to do effectively with more resources, but you know, I have not yet been successful at channel."}, {"time": 8688,

bunch of stuff too."}, {"time": 8757, "text": "We've kind of separated some of these other things into another company called Open Teams that we currently started."}, {"time": 8761, "text": "One of the things I loved about what we did at Anaconda was creating a community innovation team."}, {"time": 8765, "text": "And so I wanted to replicate that."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "This time we did a lot of innovation at Anaconda."}, {"time": 8769, "text": "I wanted to do innovation, but also contribute to the projects that existed, like create a place where maintainers, so the SciPy and NumPy and

team from scratch."}, {"time": 9349, "text": "And companies are doing it well, that's what they're doing right now."}, {"time": 9352, "text": "And you're creating a topology for some of that."},

get."}, {"time": 9403, "text": "They can make that procurement seamless."}, {"time": 9405, "text": "And then the fact they have access to the entire open source ecosystem."}, {"time": 9408, "text":

thought it was a brilliant move."}, {"time": 9438, "text": "I think they did because Microsoft has always had a developer centric culture."}, {"time": 9442, "text": "Like they always have."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "Like one of the things Microsoft's always done well is understand that their power is the developers."}, {"time": 9447, "text": "It's been, Ballmer didn't necessarily make a good meme about how he approached that."}, {"time": 9452, "text": "But they're broadening that."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "I think that's why."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "Because they recognize GitHub is where

just basically throwing money at developers to show their support?"}, {"time": 9468, "text": "Without a topology like you put it."}, {"time": 9470, "text": "Like a way to leverage that."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "Like to give developers actual money."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "They're still, it's an enterprise software company."}, {"time": 9479, "text": "And they make a bunch of money."},

they know there's opportunity to make money from GitHub."}, {"time": 9488, "text": "There's definitely a business there."}, {"time": 9489, "text": "You know, to sell to developers."}, {"time": 9491, "text": "Or to sell to people using development."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "I think there's part of that."}, {"time": 9494, "text": "I think part of it is also there's, they had definitely wanted to recognize that you need to value open source to get great developers."}, {"time": 9501, "text": "Which is an important concept that was emerging over the past 10 years."}, {"time": 9505, "text":

{"time": 9536, "text": "So I really feel kind of a privilege that I had a chance to learn some of these people and see what they're doing."}, {"time": 9541, "text": "And even work alongside them, you know, as a consultant, using open source and trying to figure, how do we make this work inside of our large organization?"}, {"time": 9549, "text": "Some of it is actually, for a large organization, some of it is messaging to the world that you care about developers and you're the cool, you care."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "Like, for example, like if Ford, cause I talked to them, like car companies, right?"}, {"time": 9563, "text": "They want to attract, you know, you want to take on Tesla and autopilot."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "You want to take on, right?"}, {"time": 9569, "text": "And so what do you do there?"}, {"time": 9571, "text": "You show that you're cool."}, {"time": 9572, "text": "Like you try to show off that you care about developers and they have a lot of trouble doing that."}, {"time": 9579, "text": "And like one way, I think like Ford should have bought GitHub."}, {"time": 9582, "text": "They just to show off, like these old school companies and it's in a lot of different industries."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "There's probably different ways."}, {"time": 9591, "text": "It's probably an art show that you care to developers."}, {"time": 9594, "text":

9607, "text": "And like literally look at like the top most popular projects in Python and just say, we're just going to give money."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "Like that's going to immediately make you cool."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "They could actually, yeah."}, {"time": 9621, "text": "And in fact, they set up NumFocus to make it easy."}, {"time": 9624, "text": "But the challenge was, is also you have to have some business development."}, {"time": 9628, "text": "Like it's a bit of a seeding problem, right?"}, {"time": 9631, "text": "And you look at how, I've talked to the folks at Linux Foundation, know how they're doing it."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "I know how, and starting NumFocus, because we had two babies in 2012."}, {"time": 9639, "text": "One was Anaconda, one was NumFocus, right?"}, {"time": 9641, "text": "And they were both important efforts."}, {"time": 9642, "text": "They had distinct journeys and super grateful that both existed and still grateful both exist."},

is a, I'm going to make money this way."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "Like if you can tie it, if you can tie the message to an ROI for the company, it becomes a brainer."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "That's more effective."}, {"time": 9665, "text": "It's much more effective, right?"}, {"time": 9666, "text": "So, and there are rational arguments to make."}, {"time": 9669, "text": "I've tried to have conversations with marketing, especially marketing departments."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "Like very early on, it was clear to me that, oh, you could just take a fraction of your marketing budget and just spend it on open source development."}, {"time": 9680, "text": "And you get better results from your marketing."}, {"time": 9683, "text": "Like, because."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "How did those, can I, sorry, I'm going to try not to go and rants here."}, {"time": 9687, "text": "What have you learned from the interaction with the marketing folks on that kind of, because you gave a great

challenge you have in academia or the different colleges, right?"}, {"time": 9706, "text": "Knowledge gets very specific and very channeled, right?"}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And so people get, they get a lot of learning in the thing they know about."}, {"time": 9713, "text": "And it's hard then to bridge that and to get them to think differently enough to have a sense that you might have something to offer because it's different."}, {"time": 9723, "text": "It's like, well, how do I implement that?"}, {"time": 9724, "text": "How do I, what do I do with that?"}, {"time": 9725, "text":

have to hire at a high position level where they care about this and this."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "Right, or they won't know how, right?"}, {"time": 9747, "text": "And because you can also do it very clumsily, right?"}, {"time": 9750, "text": "And I've seen it, cause you can, you absolutely have to honor and recognize the people you're going to and the fact that if you just throw money at them, it could actually create more problems."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "Can I just say, this is not you saying, can I just, cause I just need, I need to say this."}, {"time": 9764, "text": "I've been

"text": "Tesla's an example of people that basically don't do marketing."}, {"time": 9829, "text": "They do marketing in a very, like, let's say Elon hired a person who's just good at Twitter for running Tesla's Twitter account."}, {"time": 9837, "text": "No, right, right."}, {"time": 9839, "text": "I mean, that's exactly what you wanna be doing."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "You want it to be constantly innovating in the."}, {"time": 9843, "text": "Right, there's an aspect of telling."}, {"time": 9844, "text": "I mean, I've definitely seen people doing great work where you're not talking about it."}, {"time": 9848, "text": "Like, I would say that's actually a problem I have right now with Quonset Labs."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "Quonset Labs has been doing amazing work, really excited about it, but we have not been talking about it enough."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "We haven't been."}, {"time": 9856, "text": "And there's different ways to talk about it."}, {"time": 9857, "text": "There's different ways to, there's different channels to which to communicate."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "There's also, like, I'll just throw some shade at companies I love."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "So for example, iRobot, I just had a conversation with them."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "They make Roombas."}, {"time": 9872, "text": "And I think I love, they're incredible robots, but like every time they do like advertisement, not advertisement, but like marketing type stuff, it just looks so corporate."}, {"time": 9884, "text": "And to me, the incredible, maybe wrong in the case of iRobot, I don't know."}, {"time": 9890, "text": "But to me, when you're talking about engineering systems, it's really nice to show off the magic of the engineering and the software and all the geniuses behind this product and the tinkering and like the raw authenticity of what it takes to build that system versus the marketing people who want to have like pretty people, like standing there all pretty with the robots, like moving perfectly."}, {"time": 9914, "text": "So to me, there's some aspect, it's like speaking to the hackers, you have to throw some bones, some care towards the engineers, the developers, because there's some aspect, one, for the hiring, but two, there's an authenticity to that, authenticity to that kind of communication that's really inspiring to the end user as well."}, {"time": 9936, "text": "Like if they know that brilliant people, the best in the world are working at your company, they start to believe that that product that you're creating is really good."}, {"time": 9943, "text": "It's interesting, because your initial reaction would be, wait, there's different users here."}, {"time": 9946, "text": "Why would you do that to, you know, my wife bought a Roomba, and she loves developers, she loves me, but she doesn't care about that culture."}, {"time": 9956, "text": "So essentially what you said is actually the authenticity, because everyone has a friend, everyone knows people, there's word of mouth, I mean, if you."}, {"time": 9962, "text": "Word of mouth is so, so proper."}, {"time": 9964, "text": "Yeah, exactly, that's interesting."}, {"time": 9965, "text": "Because I think it's the lack of that realization, there's this halo effect that influences your general marketing, interesting."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "For some stupid reason, I do have a platform, and it seems that the reason I have a platform, many others like me, millions of others, is like the authenticity, and like we get excited naturally about stuff."}, {"time": 9983, "text": "And like, I don't want to get excited about that iRobot video, because it's boring, it's marketing, it's corporate, as opposed to, I wanted to do some fun, this is me, like a shout out to iRobot, is they're not letting me get into the robot."}, {"time": 9999, "text": "Yeah, well there's an aspect of, that could be benefiting from a culture of modularity, like add ons, and that could actually dramatically help."}, {"time": 10007, "text": "You've seen that over history, I mean, Apple is an example of a company like that, or the, like, I can see what your point is, is that you have something that needs to be, it needs to be adopted broadly, the concept needs to be adopted broadly."}, {"time": 10020, "text": "And if you want to go beyond this one device, you need to engage this community."}, {"time": 10024, "text": "Yeah, and connecting to the open source that you said."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "I gotta ask you, you're a programmer, one of

10055, "text": "Because I thought about this numerous times, like right now I've spent on so much time recently hiring salespeople that, That your mind is a little bit on something else."}, {"time": 10063, "text": "On something else."}, {"time": 10064, "text": "But I reflected on the past, and also, you know, I have some really, the only way I can do this, is I have some really great programmers that I work with, who lead the teams that they lead."}, {"time": 10073, "text": "And my goal is to inspire them and hopefully help them, encourage them, and be, help them encourage with their teams."}, {"time": 10079, "text": "I would say there's a number of things, couple things."}, {"time": 10081, "text": "One is curiosity."}, {"time": 10083, "text": "Like you, I think a programmer without curiosity is mundane."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "Like you'll lose interest, you won't do your best work."}, {"time": 10092, "text": "So it's sort of, it's an affect."}, {"time": 10093, "text": "It's sort of, are you, you have some curiosity about things."}, {"time": 10096, "text": "I think two, don't try to do everything at once."}, {"time": 10099, "text": "Recognize that you're, you know, we're limited as humans."}, {"time": 10101, "text": "You're limited as a human."}, {"time": 10103, "text": "And each one of us are limited in different ways."}, {"time": 10104, "text": "You know, we all have our different strengths and skills."}, {"time": 10106, "text": "So it's adapting the art of programming to your skills."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "One of the things that always works, is to limit what you're trying to solve."}, {"time": 10113, "text": "Right, so, if you're part of a team, usually maybe somebody else has put the architecture together and they've gotten given a portion for you if you're young."}, {"time": 10121, "text": "If you're not part of a team, it's sort of breaking down the problem into smaller parts, is essential for you to make progress."}, {"time": 10128, "text": "It's very easy to take on a big project and try to do it all at once, and you get lost."}, {"time": 10132, "text": "And then you do it badly."}, {"time": 10133, "text": "And so thinking about, you know, very concretely what you're doing, defining the inputs and outputs, defining what you want to get done."}, {"time": 10143, "text": "Even just talking about that and like writing down before you write code, just what are you trying to accomplish?"}, {"time": 10149, "text": "I mean, very specific about it, really, really helps."}, {"time": 10152, "text": "I think using

this for a while."}, {"time": 10183, "text": "But really, you want to cut and paste, but not blindly."}, {"time": 10187, "text": "Like, absolutely I've cut and paste to understand, but then you understand."}, {"time": 10192, "text": "Oh, this is what this means."}, {"time": 10193, "text": "Oh, this is what it's doing."}, {"time": 10194, "text": "And understand as much as you can."}, {"time":

SciPy and NumPy?"}, {"time": 10320, "text": "Hugely, yeah, absolutely lonely, in the sense of you had to have an inner drive, and that inner drive for me always comes from, I have to see that this is right in some angle."}, {"time": 10331, "text": "I have to believe it, that this is the right approach, the right thing to do."}, {"time": 10334, "text": "With SciPy, it was like, oh yeah, the world needs libraries and Python."}, {"time": 10339, "text": "Clearly Python's popular enough with enough influential people to start, and it needs more libraries."}, {"time": 10344, "text": "So that is a good in and of itself."}, {"time": 10346, "text": "So I'm gonna go do that good."}, {"time": 10348, "text": "So find a good, find a thing that you know is good and just work on it."}, {"time": 10353,

change that quickly, so."}, {"time": 10398, "text": "Let me ask a silly question, but like you said, you're focused on the sales side of things currently, but back when you were actively programming,

10550, "text": "Like typically these languages are, I even saw the whole data science programming system in Lisp that somebody created, which is cool."}, {"time": 10558, "text": "But again, I think

my head, I kind of just, I just swap between windows."}, {"time": 10623, "text": "Like, partly because I guess I really can't process three screens at once anyway."}, {"time": 10629, "text": "Like, I just am looking at one and I just flip."}, {"time": 10632, "text": "You know, I flip an application open."}, {"time": 10634, "text": "So where it's really helpful is actually when I'm trying to do,

10689, "text": "Can you give advice on how to hire great programmers and great people?"}, {"time": 10694, "text": "Yeah, I would say, produce an open source project, get people contributing to it and

find it hard to hire."}, {"time": 10711, "text": "I still find it hard to hire, like in terms of, I don't think that it's not hard to hire if I've worked with somebody for a couple of weeks, but an hour or two of interviews, I have no idea."}, {"time": 10723, "text": "So that instinct, that radar of knowing if you're good or not, that you've found that you're still not able to."}, {"time": 10730, "text": "It's really hard, I mean, the resume can help, but again, the resume is like a presentation of the things they want you to see, not the reality of, and there's also, you have to

multidimensional space?"}, {"time": 10762, "text": "There isn't one ordering."}, {"time": 10763, "text": "So this whole idea, you immediately get projected into a thing when you're talking about

have."}, {"time": 10811, "text": "And the opposite is kind of true too."}, {"time": 10813, "text": "The more product focused are, I find a lot of people, I've talked to a lot of people who produce really great products and they have a, they're looking over the open source communities, kind of wanting to participate and play, but they've played here and they do a great job here and then they don't necessarily have some of the same."}, {"time": 10829, "text": "Now I don't think that's entirely necessary."}, {"time": 10832, "text": "I think part of it is cultural, how they've emerged."},

what you..."}, {"time": 732, "text": "It's not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And if you're, for example, making a theory, I don't know, fluid

have very simple initial conditions and where you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out is you don't have that issue."}, {"time": 797, "text": "You don't have to argue about, was there something complicated put in?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "Because it's plainly obvious there wasn't."}, {"time": 801, "text": "Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments, the big thing is if the thing you see is complex and reproducible, then it didn't come from just filtering some, quotes, randomness from the outside world."}, {"time": 814, "text": "It has to be something that is intrinsically made because it wouldn't otherwise be..."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It could be the case that you set things up and it's always the same each time and you say, well, it's kind of the

what we see without that."}, {"time": 881, "text": "Now, could you add that in as an extra little featureoid without breaking the universe?"}, {"time": 889, "text": "Probably, but in fact, almost certainly yes."}, {"time": 889, "text": "But is it necessary for understanding the universe?"}, {"time": 896, "text": "And I think actually from a more fundamental point of view, I think I might be able to argue."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So one of the things that I've been interested in and been pretty surprised that I've had anything sentient to say about is the question of why does the

suspicion."}, {"time": 936, "text": "I've not thought it through."}, {"time": 940, "text": "I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense can there be randomness underneath the universe."}, {"time": 946, "text": "That is that if there is, it's something that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe."}, {"time": 952,

the only one that about that I'm pretty sure."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So now maybe which one which of these topics is better to enter first?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "Why does the universe exist and why you think it's the only one that exists?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "Well, I think they're very closely related."}, {"time": 995, "text": "OK. OK."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "So, I mean, the first thing, let's see, I mean, this why does the universe exist question is built on top of all these things that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics, because if you want to know why the universe exists, you kind of have to know what the universe is made of."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And I think the well, let me let me describe a little bit about the why does the universe exist question."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So the main issue is let's say you have a model for the universe and you say I've got this this program or

actualized?"}, {"time": 1057, "text": "OK, so there we have to start thinking about, well, well, what do we actually know about what's going on in the universe?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Well, we are observers of this universe."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "But confusingly enough, we're part of this universe."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So in a sense, we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about what's going on in the universe?"}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records about what's going on in the universe."}, {"time": 1084, "text":

should start off by saying something about the consciousness story, because that's some."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Maybe we should begin even before that at the very base layer of the Wolfram physics project."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Maybe you can give a broad overview once again really quick about this hypergraph model."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "And also, what is it a year and a half ago since

really did not see."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "I mean, the real strength of what's happened, I absolutely did not see coming."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "And the real strength of it is we've got this model for physics, but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "That's a different kind of computation like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "And that that kind of model is applicable not only to physics, but also to lots of other kinds of things."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And one reason that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "So we know a lot based on what we figured out in physics."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "And if we know

start using things that we've successfully discovered in physics and applying those intuitions in all these other areas."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And that's that's pretty exciting and very and very surprising to me."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And in fact, it's kind of like in the original story of sort of you go and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world, then you realize, well, there's all this complexity, there's all this computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "You know, there's a lot we can't know about what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1208,

everything."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Well, actually, there's this computational irreducibility thing right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to speak."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And then the question is, well, given computational irreducibility, how can we actually figure out anything about what happens in the world?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Why aren't we why are we able to predict anything?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Why are we able to operate in the world?"}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And it turns out that seems that it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics, and perhaps in a lot of these other areas, that there are these particular slices of computational reusability that are relevant to us."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "And those are the things that both allow us to operate in the world, and not just have everything be completely unpredictable."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "But there are also things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So that's, that's been sort of an exciting thing."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "But, but I would say that in general, for our project, it's been going spectacularly well."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "I mean, you know, I, it's very, honestly, it wasn't something I expected to happen in my lifetime."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "I mean, it's, you know, it's something where, where it's, it's an in fact, one of the things about it, some of the things that we've discovered, are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how things worked."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And turns out I'm wrong."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And, you know, in a major area in metamathematics, I've been realizing that I something I've long believed we can talk about it later that that that just just really isn't right."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "But But I think that the the thing that so so what's happened with the physics project?"}, {"time": 1313, "text": "I mean, you know, it's a can explain a little bit about how the how the model works."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "But basically, we can maybe ask you the following question."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So it's easy through words describe how cellular automata works, you've you've explained this."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "And it's the fundamental mechanism by which you in your book, and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world of island reducible islands and irreducible general irreducibility."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "Okay, so how does the model of hypergraphs differ from cellular automata?"}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And how does the idea of multi computation differ?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Like, maybe that's a way to describe it."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "We're we're, you know, right."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "This is a, you know, my life is like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "And, you know, it's been going for a few years now."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So it's always a challenge to kind of find these appropriate pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But let me see what I can do."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So, so I mean, first of all, let's let's talk about physics, first of all."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And, you know, a key observation, that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space?"}, {"time": 1383, "text": "What is the universe made of?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this thing where you can put things at any position you want."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And they're just points."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And they're just geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different different coordinate positions."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something, just like just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And the only thing we can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "There's a there's a there is it's this atom as opposed to this atom."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And, you know, you could give them a few a computer person, you give them UUIDs or something."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And that's all there is to say about them, so to speak."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then all we know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So we say, these three atoms of space are associated with each other in some relation."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So you can think about that as you know, what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space, you can build this essentially friend network of the atoms of space."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "And the sort of starting point of our physics project is that's what our universe is, it's a giant friend network of the atoms of space."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And so how can that possibly represent our universe?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Well, it's like in something like water, you know, their molecules bouncing around, but on a large scale that, you know, that produces fluid flow, and we have fluid vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "And by the way, it's important that that collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility, that's actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics among other things."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous type of thing."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And so okay, so first thing is space is made of something, it's made of all these atoms of space connected together in this network."}, {"time": 1513, "text":

the fluid, but the vortex still stays there."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic element."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So there's the levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "If you squint and kind of blur things out, it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity."},

you convert to the elementary energy?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And how do you convert to between other things?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And the various constants we know, we know the speed of

know things like the size of the universe, the Hubble constant, things like that."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And essentially, this calculation of the elementary length comes from looking at the combination of those."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Okay, so the most obvious thing, people have assumed that quantum gravity happens at this thing, the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the combination of Planck's constant and the gravitational constant, the speed of light, that gives you that kind of length."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "Turns out in our model, there is an additional

complicated story."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And this is a more extreme version of that."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space, we've got this notion of time."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And one of the things that's important about that time is this sort of

updated in this way and that, there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And really, in the end, the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "So an event in this sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And that means a few

there again, you said the fact that the observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what's missing?"}, {"time": 2382, "text": "What is the observer not able to state about this universe of space and

machine?"}, {"time": 2435, "text": "Could the universe just have a single updating head that's just zipping around all over the place?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "You say, that's crazy because I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating, I'm updating, et cetera."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "But the thing is, there's no way to know that because if there was just this head moving around, it's like,

"So, the human brain is where it starts, but we've built a bunch of instruments to do a bit better than the human brain, but they still have many of the same kinds of ideas, you know, their cameras

devices."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "So, it's always just an extension of the consciousness experience."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Or our sensory experience."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Sensory experience, but sensory experience is somehow intricately tied to consciousness."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "Well, so one question is, when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas, and there might be 10 to the 20th molecules in some little box or something, it's like, what do we notice about those molecules?"}, {"time": 2904, "text": "So, one thing that we can say is, we don't notice that much."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "We are, you know, we are computationally bounded observers."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "We can't go in and say, okay, I'm the 10 to the 20th molecules, and I know that

"And so, one key feature of us is that we are computationally bounded."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of computation and doing huge amounts of computation, but we are computationally bounded, there's only certain things about that universe that we're going to be sensitive to."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "We're not going to be, you know,

the two defining features of consciousness that, and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the preamble to this is, for years, you know, as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental features of physics and science, people ask me, so what about consciousness?"}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And I, for years, I've said, I have nothing to say about consciousness."}, {"time": 2976,

got all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "Similarly for intelligence, we know the human definition of intelligence, but what is intelligence abstractly?"}, {"time": 2998, "text": "And so, what I've long believed is that sort of the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "That is, that as soon as you can be computationally sophisticated, that's kind of the abstract version, the generalized version of intelligence."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "So, then the question is, what about consciousness?"}, {"time": 3020, "text": "And what I sort of realized is that consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "That is, that you might think, oh, you know, consciousness is the top of the pie, but it's the top of the pile."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "But actually, I don't think it is."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "I think that there's this notion of kind of computational sophistication, which is the generalized intelligence."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "But consciousness has two limitations, I think."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "One of them is computational boundedness."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "That is, that we're only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "And the other is this idea of a single thread of time."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "That is, that we, and in fact, we know neurophysiologically our brains go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "And it isn't the case that in all the neurons in our brains that, at least in our conscious, the correspondence of language, in our conscious experience, we just have the single thread of attention, single thread of perception."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "And maybe there's something unconscious that's bubbling around that's the kind of almost the quantum version of what's happening in our brain, so to speak."},

those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of conscious stream of experience."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is much broader than the computational constraints which consciousness operates under, and also the sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "But then the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence, and how does that connect to our human brain?"}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Because you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric, like what we like plug into it or something, like our consciousness plugs into it."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some level is just a word, but we are asking, you know, what is the notion of intelligence as we generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans have built and so on?"}, {"time": 3153, "text": "You know, what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 3153, "text": "You know, is the weather, you know, people say the weather has a mind of its own."},

your conception of computation, just intelligence is the capacity to perform computation and the sea of?"}, {"time": 3174, "text": "I mean, I think that's right."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And I think that, you know, this question of, is it for a purpose?"}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible philosophical mess."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a purpose?"}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Well, yes, it did."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator to the poles or something."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "That's its purpose."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "Because I seem to be equally as dumb today as I was yesterday."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "So there's some persistence, like a consistency over time that the intelligence I plugged into."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint between the amount of computation I can perform in my consciousness."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "Like they seem to be really closely connected somehow."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is we don't know intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And the ones that are very much like us, I think have this feature of single thread of time, bounded, you know, computationally bounded."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But you also need computational sophistication."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "Having a single thread of time and being computationally bounded, you could just be a clock going tick tock."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "That would satisfy those conditions."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible computational ability, that's an important feature."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "That's sort of the bedrock on which we can construct the things we construct."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the single thread of time and

think exist."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that there is, you know, continuous space, let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it does?"},

box, we could be sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "And we could say what really matters is the, you know, the wiggle effect that is, you know, that is something that we humans just never noticed because it's some weird thing that happens when there are 15 collisions of air molecules and this happens and that happens."},

case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say, how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to?"}, {"time": 3360, "text": "What seems to be the case is that as soon as we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general relativity."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "In other words, we can't avoid that."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "That's the way that we will parse the universe."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Given those constraints, we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible sort of pocket of computational reducibility that we slice out of this kind of whole

it doesn't."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "This is when I say general relativity, that's the uber theory, so to speak."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make, you know, on the earth and things like that."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive something very different from gravity."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "So so the way to understand that is when we think about OK, so we make up reference frames with which we parse what's happening in space and time."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So in other words, one of the one of the things that we do is we say as time progresses everywhere in space is something happens at a particular time and

is because, you know, when we look around, we might see, you know, ten hundred meters away."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "The time it takes light to travel that distance is really short compared to the time it takes our brains to know what happened."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the universe in this."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "There is a moment in

definite structure."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "We move to the next moment in time, space has another structure."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "That kind of setup is what lets us kind of deduce kind of what parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity works the way it does."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that is that you're saying that's somehow useful for consciousness."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "That's what consciousness does."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "Because in a sense, what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the

you tell?"}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So photon is a really boring story."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "I mean, so that's a, I don't know if they're a boring story, but I think it's, you know, I've been wondering about this and I've been asking, you know, friends of mine who are science fiction writers and things, have you written stuff about this?"}, {"time": 3680, "text": "And I've got one example,

fiction books very often."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "And I was just thrilled."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "I get to the end of this and it's like, oh, my gosh, you know, everything is saved by this sort of deep scientific principle."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "Can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational equivalence can save a planet?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "That would, that would be a terrible spoiler."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "That would be a spoiler."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "But no, but let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "So the question is, you are, you have a system, you have some rule, you can think of its behavior as corresponding to a computation."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "The question is, how sophisticated is that computation?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "The statement of the principle of computational equivalence is, as soon as it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated as anything."}, {"time":

equivalent to rule 30."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "So we're kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort of raw, the same level of computation, so to speak."}, {"time": 3808,

servers, get us more servers."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "The way to get even more servers is turn the whole planet into a bunch of microservers."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And that's where it starts."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And so the question of, you know, computational equivalence, principle of computational equivalence is, well, actually, you don't need to build those custom servers."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "Actually, you can just use natural computation to compute things, so to speak."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "You can use nature to compute."}, {"time": 3846, "text":

environment."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "And then you look at that thing and you say, it's got electrons moving around, just like in a rock."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And then you say, well, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And the principle of computational equivalence says there isn't, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can't say, mathematically, there's a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human consciousness and the rock that's just a rock."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Now, what I've sort of realized with this kind of consciousness thing is there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "And for example, something I haven't really teased apart properly is when it comes to something like the weather

in some sense."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "When you're talking about, just to backtrack a little bit about cellular automata, being able to, what's it like to be a cellular automata in the way that's equivalent to what is it like to be a conscious human being?"}, {"time": 4258, "text": "How do you approach that?"}, {"time": 4258, "text": "So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata, asking questions of that subset, like how the world is perceived, how you as that subset, like for that local pocket of computation, what are you able to say about the broader cellular time?"},

it's doing is it has a view of itself."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And the question is, how do you get inside it?"}, {"time": 4293, "text": "It's like when we, with humans, it's like we can't get

our consciousness and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding what's going on there?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "And there's a way of thinking about this."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "Okay, so this is coming on to questions about the existence of the universe and so on."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "But one of the things is there's this notion that we have of ruleal space."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "So we have this idea of this physical space, which is something you can move around in that's associated with the extent of the spatial hypergraph."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "Then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching histories, there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space, you're moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another possible history."},

slowly understanding things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what's happening is branchial space is associated with phase in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "And what's happening is the two photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at different ends of branchial space."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And so us as these poor observers that have branching brains that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history and say, we've really got a consistent story that we're telling here."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "We're really knitting together these threads of history."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "By the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial space, we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "So for us, that's sort of the analog of destructive interference."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "And then there's rule space too, which is the space of rules."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "Well, that's another level up."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "So there's the question."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "Actually, I do want to mention one thing because it's something I've realized in recent times and I think it's really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and relativity."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And it kind of helps to understand it's something that kind of helps in understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate, you send it in a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light, to you as an observer at rest, that clock that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much more slowly."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "And so in other words, it's kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out where they're hanging out."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "Okay, why does that happen?"}, {"time": 4642, "text": "Okay, so it has to do with what motion is."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "So in our models of physics, what is motion?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere, you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again, you're updating yourself, you're following these rules to update what happens."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "And so time dilation ends up being, it's really cool, actually, that this is explainable in a way that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "But time dilation is a story of the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some of your computation."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what happens progressively with time."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "So that means that time is running more slowly for you because it is, you're using up your computation, your clock can't tick as quickly, because every tick of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at, you know, half the speed of light or something."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "And so that's why time dilation happens."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "And so you can start, so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity and so on."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that picture is, because you're using up computation."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Okay, so we're simply saying the entity is updating itself according to the way that the universe updates itself."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And the question is, you know, those updates, let's imagine the you as a clock."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And the clock is, you know, there's all these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "And all of those updates are contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going back and forth or the little oscillator moving, whatever it is."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "But then the alternative is that sort of situation one, where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it's kind of moving, what's happening is it is having to recreate itself at every moment, the thing is going to have to do the computations to be able to sort of recreate itself at a different position in space."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "And that's kind of the intuition behind, so it's either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a different position in space, or it's going to spend its computation doing the sort of doing the updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the clock, so to speak."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "So the more updating is doing, the less the ticking of the clock update is doing."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "The more it's having to update because of motion, the less it can update the clock."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Obviously, there's a sort of mathematical version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity, but that's kind of, to me, that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story there."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "But the thing about this physical space and physical space, the main sort of big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity, and that tells you how things move in physical space."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "In branchial space, the big theory is the Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells you essentially how things move in quantum in the space of quantum phases."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "So it's kind of like motion in branchial space."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons and black holes and so on."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "What are the analogous things in branchial space?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "For example, the speed of light, what's the analog of the speed of light in branchial space?"}, {"time": 4915, "text": "It's the maximum speed of quantum entanglement."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "What's the maximum rate at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space?"}, {"time": 4926, "text": "So similarly, in branchial space, something happens."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "And the question is, how far in this branchial space, in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time?"}, {"time": 4943, "text": "And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "And that might be observable."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "That's the thing we've been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it, even in some atomic physics kind of situation?"}, {"time": 4952, "text": "Because one of the things that's weird in quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms of small numbers of particles."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "This electron does this, this thing on an ion trap does that and so on."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "It's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "And it's like, but wait a minute, in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "There's always just some wave function for this to happen."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable, it just ended up in this place?"}, {"time": 5017, "text": "And you have to kind of say, well, the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing about measurements have to do with this idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened?"}, {"time": 5032, "text": "Because in quantum mechanics, the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about, they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "Then there's this thing of, and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And that has to do with this thing, I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happened."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it's just like, after you've done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement and it's all over."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "And that's been very confusing."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "For example, in quantum computing, it's been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing, the basic idea is you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak, to do all the different parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something like this."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And it looks like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads going on."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "But then you have to say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite thing that we humans can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this output."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it's possible to then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?"}, {"time": 5121, "text": "I think it's likely, yes."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Every one of these things, when you go from the underlying theory, which is complicated enough and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple, but as soon as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to things that we humans can talk about, it gets really complicated."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And this thing about actually getting it to a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something like this, that's just a lot of work."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "There's a thing called the quantum Zeno effect."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make a measurement, you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So it looks like there's a possibility that with sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many body quantum mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be possible to actually figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And the reason we can potentially do that is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they're pretty big."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "A mole of atoms is a lot of atoms, but it's something where to get, when we're dealing with how can you see 10 to the minus 100, so to speak?"}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Well, by the time you've got 10 to the 30th atoms, you're within a little bit closer striking distance of that."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "It's not like, oh, we've just got two atoms and we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "So I don't know how it will work, but this is a potential direction."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "These are all related."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "So if we get that one number, we just need one number."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "If we can get that one number, the theory has no parameters anymore."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "And there are other places, well, there's another hope for doing that is in cosmology."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed dimensional."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "We think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn't have any particular dimension."}, {"time":

you go a distance R away from a given point?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "And you can say, well, if I get to about R cubed nodes, when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph, then I'm living roughly in three dimensional space."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "But you might also get to R to the point 2.92 for some value of R. As R increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "And so one of the things we suspect is that the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional, and that as the universe expanded, it became lower dimensional."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "And so one of the things that is another little sort of point where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations in the early universe."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "That is, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe?"}, {"time": 5310, "text": "Is it still the case that there were pieces of the universe that didn't have dimension three, that had dimension 3.01 or something?"}, {"time": 5319, "text": "And can we tell that?"}, {"time": 5319, "text": "Is that possible to observe fluctuations in dimensions?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "So the question, which should be an elementary exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space."}, {"time": 5339,

the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "It's R to the whatever 2.01 or something."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do optics, you know, a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every piece of a wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves."}, {"time":

frequency, we can measure their direction, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5409, "text": "And, you know, how that all works out."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "And, you know, in the current models of physics, you know, it's been hard to explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is."}, {"time": 5421, "text": "And that's led to this inflation idea that, to the great annoyance of my then collaborator, we figured out in like 1979, we had this realization that you could get something like this."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "But it seemed implausible that that's the way the universe worked."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "So we put it in a footnote."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "But in any case, I've never really completely believed it."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "But that's an idea for

these mathematical structures."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't typically sit on anything."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "They're just mathematical structures."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "And I think what's happened is our models provide kind of a machine code that lives underneath those models."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "So a typical example, this is due to Jonathan Gorod, who's one of the key people who's been working on our project."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "This is in, okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "This is in causal set theory."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in spacetime, we imagine that there's space and time."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "It's a three plus one dimensional, you know, setup."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "We imagine that there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "And then the whole sort of theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships between these randomly thrown down events."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "So they've always been confused by the fact that to get even Lorentz invariants, even relativistic invariants, you need a very special way to throw down those events."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So what Jonathan figured out is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating events at random, our models necessarily generate events in some pattern in spacetime effectively that then leads to Lorentz invariants and relativistic invariants and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "So it's a place where all the mathematics that's been done on, well, we just have a random collection of events."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "Now what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on?"}, {"time": 5830, "text": "That can all be kind of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics and connect them."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And it's really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "But we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "I mean, it's like saying you can think about computation abstractly."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "You can think about, I don't know, combinators or something as abstract computational things."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And you can sort of do all kinds of study of them."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "But it's like, why do we care?"}, {"time": 5886, "text": "Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because you can kind of see they're sort of mechanically doing things."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "But when we actually start thinking about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And this is sort of what we're providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical physics."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So that's been very nice."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So I'm not sure we've ever got to the question of why does the universe exist at all?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "No, no, let's talk about that."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So it's not the simplest question in the world."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "So it takes a few steps to get to it."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "And it's nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "I'm very surprised."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleal space."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "So we've got kind of physical space."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "We've got branchial space, the space of possible quantum histories."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleal space."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And here's where that comes from."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "So you say, okay, you say we've got this model for the universe."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "We've got a particular rule."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "And we run this rule and we get the universe."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "Why that rule?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "Why not another rule?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And so that confused me for a long time."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And I realized, well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "What if at every step, in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph, one could say, just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places in this hypergraph."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "And then you make this ruleal multiway graph, which both is all possible histories for a particular rule and all possible rules."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "So the next thing you'd say is, how can you get anything reasonable out of it?"}, {"time": 5993, "text": "How can anything real come out of the set of all possible rules applied in all possible ways?"}, {"time": 5998, "text": "This is a subtle thing, which I haven't fully untangled."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "And you might say, if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything possible happen?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "Well, the answer is because when you, there's sort of this entanglement that occurs."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different possible states."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "Then you're applying these different rules."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "Well, some of those rules can end up with the same state."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "There's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there's a definite structure that's produced."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "I think I'm going to call that definite structure the rulead, the limit of kind of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways."}, {"time": 6048, "text": "And you're saying that structure is finite, so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "Well, it happens that the rulead necessarily has causal invariance."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "That's a feature of, that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will always converge."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "But does that necessarily infer that the rulead is finite?"}, {"time": 6081, "text": "In the end, it's not necessarily finite."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "I mean, just like the history of the universe may not be finite."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "The history of the universe, time may keep going forever."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "You can keep running the computations of the rulead and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "It's like time doesn't have to end."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this rulead object."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "One is how long you run the computation for."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "Another is how many different rules you're applying."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "And another is how many different states you start from."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "And the mixture of those three limits."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "And what's interesting about this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with ideas in higher category theory."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's most abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck."}, {"time": 6132, "text": "Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity groupoid, which is closely related to this rulead object."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "Although the details of the relationship, you know, I don't fully understand yet."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "But I think that what's interesting is this thing that is sort of this very limiting object."}, {"time": 6151, "text": "So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again, will take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid and things like that."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "You can think about, in mathematics, you can think you have certain axioms, they're kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk about mathematics for a second."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "What is it made of, so to speak?"}, {"time": 6181, "text": "Mathematics, there's a bunch of statements, like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that's a statement in mathematics."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus one, x minus one."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics."}, {"time": 6201, "text": "Well, it's not, I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y, it's a rule that you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "It is a rule."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "The statement of truth, okay."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "And what you can imagine is, you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean of all statements."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing into a different thing."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "Let me not go in this direction for a second."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "Let's not go to metamathematics just yet."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "Yeah, we'll maybe get to metamathematics, but it's, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid and things later."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "But, so let's come back to the universe, always a good place to be in, so to speak."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "Yeah, so what does the universe have to do with the rule add, the rule of L space, and how that's possibly connected to why the thing exists at all, and why there's just one of them?"}, {"time": 6258, "text": "So here's the point."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "So the thing that had confused me for a long time was, let's say we get the rule for the universe."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "We hold it in our hand."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "We say, this is our universe."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "Then the immediate question is, well, why isn't it another one?"}, {"time": 6268, "text": "And that's kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is, we're not very special."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "So how come we got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion?"}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all possible rules."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule?"}, {"time": 6298, "text": "How do we perceive definite things happening in the universe?"}, {"time": 6302, "text": "Well, it's the same story."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "It's the observer, there is a reference frame that we are picking in this ruleal space, and that that is what determines our perception of the universe."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the universe in this particular way."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "So here's the way to think about it."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "In physical space, we live in a particular place in the universe."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And we could live on Alpha Centauri, but we don't."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "We live here."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And similarly, in ruleal space, we could live in many different places in ruleal space, but we happen to live here."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And what does it mean to live here?"}, {"time": 6336, "text": "It means we have certain sensory input."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "We have certain ways to parse the universe."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "Those are our interpretation of the universe."}, {"time": 6347, "text": "What would it mean to travel in ruleal space?"}, {"time": 6347, "text": "What it basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways."}, {"time": 6356, "text": "So in other words, to be at a different point in ruleal space is to have a different, in a sense, a different interpretation of what's going on in the universe."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "And we can imagine even things like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in ruleal space and so on."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "So wait, what's the interpretation?"}, {"time": 6370, "text": "So ruleal space and we, I'm confused by the we and the interpretation and the universe."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "I thought moving about in ruleal space changes the way the universe is."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "The way we would perceive it."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "So it ultimately has to do with the perception."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "So it doesn't real, ruleal space is not somehow changing, like branching into another universe or something like that."}, {"time": 6401, "text": "No, I mean, the point is that the whole point of this is the rule yard is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the universe running according to all possible rules."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "We think of our universe, the observable universe, as a thing."}, {"time": 6420, "text": "So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn't the rule yard potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite set of what we human physicists think of as universes?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "That's an interesting, interesting parsing of the word universe, right?"}, {"time": 6440, "text": "Because what we're saying is, just as we're at a particular place in physical space, we're at a particular place in ruleal space, at that particular place in ruleal space, our experience of the universe is this."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "Just as if we lived at the center of the galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is, given where we actually live."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "And so what we're saying is, you might say, I mean, in a sense, this rule yard is sort of a super universe, so to speak."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "But it's all entangled together."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "It's not like you can separate out."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "You can say, let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe, but it's still the same universe."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "So there's not like universes existing in parallel?"}, {"time": 6490, "text": "Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same rule yard."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "That's the same universe."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "You're just moving about."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "These are just coordinates in the universe."}, {"time": 6514, "text": "So the reason that's interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence, so the alien intelligence, we should say."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri, but it might also live at a different place in real space."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "It can live right here on Earth."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "It just has a different reference frame that includes a very different perception of the universe."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "And then because that real space is very large, I mean, Do we get to communicate with them?"}, {"time": 6544, "text": "Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And I mean, one thing to realize is, even in kind of things I don't understand well, you know, I know about the kind of Western tradition of understanding, you know, science and all that kind of thing."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "And, you know, you talk to people who say, well, I, you know, I'm really into some, you know, Eastern tradition of this, that and the other."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "And it's really obvious to me how things work."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "I don't understand it at all."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "But, you know, it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization that there's these very different ways to interpret what's going on in the universe."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "That kind of gives me at least, it doesn't help me to understand that different interpretation."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "But it gives me at least more respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like, what is it, reincarnation or all these like eternal recurrence with Nietzsche, like just these ideas?"}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that, you know, I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand, you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things?"}, {"time": 6620, "text": "And you realize that some of these concepts like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a kid, and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know, well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh?"}, {"time": 6635, "text": "And people are like, well, how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything?"}, {"time": 6641, "text": "Well, now we understand, you know, there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains, and it's something computational."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And there is a sense and in fact, it is correct, that it is in some sense, immortal, because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular material of a brain."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific approach."}, {"time": 6667, "text": "But it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something doesn't weigh anything."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "That's a kind of a silly question."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "How much does it weigh?"}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Well, actually, maybe it isn't such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual computational activity has has a consequence for gravity and things, but that's a very subtle."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "You can talk about mass and energy and so on."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "That could be a, what would you call it, a solitron."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "A particle that somehow contains soulness."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "And, you know, one thing I've never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monadology, and he had this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "And that they that the only thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to each other."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "It sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right?"}, {"time": 6717, "text": "But Leibniz had really lost me at the following thing."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "He said, each of these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "And it's like, okay, I'm out of here."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "I don't understand this at all."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "But I realized recently that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "That was his only way of describing that."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "And so what I would now say is, well, there's this abstract rule that runs."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "To Leibniz, that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of, well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "And so, you know, in a sense, it's like one of these, there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak."}, {"time": 6758, "text": "That's a sort of a version of the same kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different from the ones that we would use today."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate on your conception of consciousness that, like the two characteristics of it that is constrained, and there's a single thread of time?"}, {"time": 6779, "text": "Is it possible that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom, the discrete atom of space has a consciousness?"}, {"time": 6787, "text": "Is that, so these are just words, right?"}, {"time": 6787,

think... Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?"}, {"time": 6807, "text": "I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about kind of, if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something, could we say, well, so that's really a question of a different point of view, a different place in real space."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "We're asking the question, could there be a civilization that exists?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "Could there be sort of conscious entities that exist at the level of atoms of space?"}, {"time": 6834, "text": "And what would that be like?"}, {"time": 6834, "text": "And I think that comes back to this question of, what's it like to be a cellular automaton type thing?"}, {"time": 6838, "text": "I mean, I'm not yet there."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "I mean, I think that this is a...

think the interesting thing for me is, you know, what is it like to be a whatever?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "How do you describe that?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "I mean, that's not a thing that you describe in mathematics, the what is it like to be such and such."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "Well, see, to me, when you say what is it like to be something, it presumes that you're talking about a singular entity."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "So, like, there's some kind of feeling of the entity, the stuff that's inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "And then that's when consciousness starts making sense."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "But then it seems like that could be generalizable."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "If you take some subset of a cellular automata,

exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and whatever else."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "But the thing is that in some sense that there is, it is a different kind of thing to say, does plus

system, once we exist as observers embedded in that formal system, that's enough to have something which is like our universe."}, {"time": 7839, "text": "And so then what you're kind of asking is perhaps is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it."}, {"time": 7853, "text": "There's nothing that says that we're not saying that it's sort of inevitable that that is a thing that we

we can represent formally?"}, {"time": 8010, "text": "You can make a world that deals with all possible rules, and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place in that world, so to speak, we

ago, a little bit more than 100 years ago, people have been doing mathematics for ages, but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you know, it is mathematics

a question of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space."}, {"time": 8941, "text": "And so the question is in proof space, what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof space?"}, {"time": 8954, "text": "Yeah, I don't even know what an obstruction means in proof space because for it to be an obstruction, it should be reachable some other way from some other place, right?"}, {"time": 8959, "text": "So this is like an unreachable part of the graph."}, {"time": 8965, "text": "No, it's not just an unreachable part."}, {"time": 8965, "text": "It's a part where there are paths that go one way, there are paths that go the other way."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "And this question of homotopy in mathematics is this question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to another path or do you have to go in a jump, so to speak?"}, {"time": 8979, "text": "So it's like if you're going around a sphere, for example, if you're going around, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can wind around one way and you can, there's no paths where you can easily deform one path into another because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "But when you've got something that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point because it's, it's stuck

a proof of something over here in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry."}, {"time": 9022, "text": "And there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "How would that be possible if they started the same place and ended the same place?"}, {"time": 9032, "text": "Well, it's the same thing as, you know, we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on a cylinder."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "Now I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn't, it feels like proof space shouldn't have that."}, {"time": 9044, "text": "I mean, I'm not sure."}, {"time": 9047, "text": "We'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments."}, {"time": 9047, "text": "This is the great thing about this stuff is that in fact, you know, in the next few days, I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this."}, {"time": 9056, "text": "So you're playing like proofs in this kind of space."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "I mean, so, you know, this is toy, you know, theories and, you know, we've got good."}, {"time": 9067, "text": "So this kind of segues to perhaps another thing, which is this whole idea of multi computation."}, {"time": 9073, "text": "So this is another kind of bigger idea that, so, okay, this has to do with how do you make models of things?"}, {"time": 9081, "text": "And it's going to, so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort of four epochs in the history of making models of things."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "And this multi computation thing is the fourth, is a new

made of?"}, {"time": 9112, "text": "Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on."}, {"time": 9118, "text": "It's like a structural idea of how the

made?"}, {"time": 9123, "text": "Then we get to the 1600s and we get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "And then we have this kind of

parameter."}, {"time": 9141, "text": "We just can, you know, sort of slide it back and forth and say, here's where it is."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "Then we come to this kind of computational idea that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s as a result, you know, the things that we were talking about before about complexity, that was my motivation."}, {"time": 9159, "text": "But the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "And the big difference there from the mathematical models is, in mathematical models, there's an equation, you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it."}, {"time": 9172, "text": "In computational models, you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule."}, {"time":

you work out how the system behaves."}, {"time": 9191, "text": "You don't, time is not just a parameter."}, {"time": 9191, "text": "Time is something that is about the running of these rules."},

there's still one thread of time."}, {"time": 9201, "text": "It's still the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and so on."}, {"time": 9211,

threads of time."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "And so in this multi computation paradigm, the kind of idea is, instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous threads of time that are happening."}, {"time": 9232, "text": "And the thing that's sort of different there is if you want to know what happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case of the computational paradigm, you just say, well, after a thousand steps, we got this result, right?"}, {"time": 9242, "text": "But in the multi computational paradigm, after a thousand steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means, because you've got all these different threads of time, but there is no state."}, {"time": 9253, "text": "There's all these different possible, you know, there's all these different paths."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "And so the only way you can know what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here's how to parse the results of what was going on."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete picture."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "So in the case of physics, that's right."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "And then in the, but that's, but so the idea is that in this multi computation setup, that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time and models that are based on that."},

has a definite state."}, {"time": 9287, "text": "It follows another state, follows another state."}, {"time": 9292, "text": "But typically what people have done when they thought about these kinds of things is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths, and non deterministic Turing machine can follow all these possible paths, but we just want one of them."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "We just want the one that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "And similarly, it's the same story in logic programming and so on, but we say, we've got this goal, find us a path to that goal."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "I just want one path, then I'm happy."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "Or theorem proving, same story."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "I just want one proof and then I'm happy."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "What's happening in multi computation in physics is we actually care about many paths."}, {"time": 9323, "text": "And well, there is a case, for example, probabilistic programming is a version of multi computation in which you're looking at all the paths."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "You're just asking for probabilities of things."},

all these multiple paths."}, {"time": 9343, "text": "But the thing that is notable is that when you're an observer embedded in this thing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on, it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity and quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi computational setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "Now, why is this perhaps not surprising?"}, {"time": 9376, "text": "In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent laws of sort of gas dynamics that are independent of the details of the molecular dynamics, sort of the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 9388, "text": "But I think what happens is what's a sort of a funny thing that I just been understanding very recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of computational paradigm complexity ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do."}, {"time": 9408, "text": "And then what I realized is and then you might say, now we've got multi computation, it's even worse."}, {"time": 9412, "text": "You know, it isn't just one thread of time that we can't explain."}, {"time": 9412, "text": "It's all these threads of time."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "It can't explain anything."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "But the following thing happens because there is all this irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer, it's very hard to answer."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "But when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational boundedness, sequentiality of time and so on, that observer only samples certain aspects of this incredible complexity going on in this multi computational system."}, {"time": 9439,

these details."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "But to that kind of observer, what's important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer observes comparatively simple laws."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And I think it is inevitable that that observer observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum mechanics, which, by the way, are the same law in our in our model of physics."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "So that's an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer."}, {"time": 9481, "text": "But what the place where this gets really interesting is there are all these fields of science where people have kind of gotten stuck, where they say we'd really love to have a physics like theory of economics."},

where where does multi computation come in for biology?"}, {"time": 9502, "text": "Economics is super interesting, too, but biology."}, {"time": 9502, "text": "OK, let's talk about that."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "So let's talk about chemistry for a second."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "OK, so I mean, I have to say, you know, this is it's such a weird business for me because, you know, there are these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "And it's like I've always said, I know nothing about chemistry."}, {"time": 9519, "text": "I learned all the chemistry I know, you know, the night before some exam when I was 14 years old."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "But I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "And in Wolfram language these days, we have really pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry."}, {"time": 9531, "text": "And in understanding the design of that, I've actually, I think, learned a certain amount of chemistry."}, {"time": 9535, "text": "So if you quizzed me on sort of basic high school chemistry, I would probably totally fail."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "But but but OK, so what is chemistry?"}, {"time": 9539, "text": "I mean, chemistry is sort of a story of, you know, chemical reactions are like you've got this particular chemical that's represented as some graph of, you know, these are these are this configuration of molecules with these bonds and so on."}, {"time": 9555, "text": "And a chemical reaction happens."}, {"time": 9555, "text": "You've got these sort of two graphs."}, {"time": 9560, "text": "They interact in some way."}, {"time": 9560, "text": "You've got another graph or multiple other graphs out."}, {"time": 9564, "text": "So that's kind of the sort of the the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry."}, {"time": 9570, "text": "And so when you do a chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these are possible reactions that can happen."}, {"time": 9576, "text": "And you're asked, can you piece together this sequence of such reactions, a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions usually called name reactions in chemistry?"}, {"time": 9585, "text": "Can you piece together a sequence of these reactions so that you get out at the end this great molecule you were trying to synthesize?"}, {"time": 9590, "text": "And so that's a story very much like theorem proving."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at kind of the theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really it didn't it didn't was sort of done too early, I think."}, {"time": 9604, "text": "But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry, chemical reactions are the story of of all these different sort of paths of possible things that go on."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "OK, let's let's go to an even lower level."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "Let's say instead of asking about which species of molecules we're talking about, let's look at individual molecules and let's say we're looking at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we're building up this big graph of all these reactions that are happening."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "OK, so so then we've got this big graph."}, {"time": 9636, "text": "And by the way, that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things."}, {"time": 9642, "text": "In fact, in the underlying theory of multi computation there, these things we call token event graphs, which are basically you've broken your state into tokens."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "Like in the case of a hypergraph, you've broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens and producing some number of tokens."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "But then you have to there's a lot of work to be done on update rules in terms of what they actually are for chemistry."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "Yeah, what they offer are observed chemistry."}, {"time": 9668, "text": "And we've been working on that actually because we have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "So we actually have you know, this is this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for some practical cases."},

discover them automatically."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "But I think in, in reality, right now, it's like there are these particular reactions."}, {"time": 9695, "text": "And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a particular subtype of chemistry."}, {"time": 9699, "text": "And just because because let me explain where this is going to the place that his his where this is going."}, {"time": 9705, "text": "So got this whole network of all these molecules, having all these reactions and so on."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And this is some whole multi computational story because each each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event."}, {"time": 9716, "text": "We're saying they will happen asynchronously."}, {"time": 9722, "text": "We're not

saying they happen in some order."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And then we ask, what is the what what's the you know, how do we think about the system?"}, {"time": 9736, "text": "Well, this thing is

about is did you make that particular drug molecule?"}, {"time": 9747, "text": "You're just asking, you know, the for the one path."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "Another thing you might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I want to know, you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the concentrations."},

"text": "And so that the question then is, so let me give an analogy."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular biology and molecular computing."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "When we think about a computation, usually, we say it's input, it's output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there's this input, we're going to make this

imagine you're a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer?"}, {"time": 9832, "text": "Well, in molecular biology, there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist,

story."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions, we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what

molecular processes going on in, you know, in biological systems, what matters?"}, {"time": 9886, "text": "And, you know, one of the things is to be able to tell what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked."}, {"time": 9897, "text": "Because before that time, you know, genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things."}, {"time": 9903, "text": "And then it was realized, ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn't obvious before that time,

freak Turing out for sure, because then the dynamics of the trajectory of the computation matters."}, {"time": 10019, "text": "I mean, but the thing is that that, so this is again, a story of what's the observer, so to speak."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "In chemistry, what's the observer there?"}, {"time": 10030, "text": "Now to give an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present

different kinds of T cell receptors that we produce."}, {"time": 10049, "text": "And the traditional theory of immunology is this clonal selection theory where we are constantly producing, randomly

get this whole dynamic network of interactions between different immune system cells."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "And that was kind of a qualitative theory at that time."}, {"time": 10096, "text":

know, for example, immune memory, where is the where does the immune memory reside?"}, {"time": 10131, "text": "Is it actually some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that's going to spring into action as soon as we're shown the same antigen?"}, {"time": 10139, "text": "Or is it something different from that?"}, {"time": 10145, "text": "Is it something more dynamic?"}, {"time": 10145, "text": "Is it something more like some network of interactions between these different kinds of immune system cells and so on?"}, {"time": 10149, "text":

at least I understand that theory."}, {"time": 10183, "text": "But but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in that this is a place where if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being this sort of dynamic network."}, {"time": 10196, "text": "And then the the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak, the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it's kind of like, does the human get sick or whatever?"}, {"time": 10206, "text": "But it's a it's something which is a complicated story that relates to this

this whole sort of world of different kinds of computation that you can do, sort of multi computationally."}, {"time": 10972, "text": "And that's a, that's an interesting thing."}, {"time": 10977,

followed and so on."}, {"time": 11234, "text": "So the question is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics?"}, {"time": 11241, "text": "And then my test case is again, what is time dilation in economics?"}, {"time": 11247, "text": "And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where people are growing lettuces and fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well, if you're transporting lettuces to different places, what is the value of the lettuces after you have to transport them versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them, you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there."}, {"time": 11267, "text": "But I think there's a better and more complete analogy."}, {"time": 11271, "text": "And that's the question of, is there a theory like

a different direction."}, {"time": 11467, "text": "And it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world that knows about, you know, different kinds of cookies and

of the use cases for that is computational contracts."}, {"time": 11560, "text": "Another use case is something like the constitution that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do."}, {"time":

computational language."}, {"time": 11675, "text": "Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run the world with code?"}, {"time": 11680, "text": "That is, how do you write sort of all these things which are right now, regulations and laws and contracts and things in computational language?"}, {"time": 11685, "text": "And kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of something happens in the world, and then there's this giant domino effect of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened."}, {"time": 11695, "text": "And there's a whole story to that."}, {"time": 11700, "text": "And of course, I like to always pay attention to the latest things that are going on."}, {"time": 11706, "text": "And I really, I kind of like blockchain because it's another rethinking of kind of computation."}, {"time": 11711, "text": "It's kind of like cloud computing was a little bit of that, of sort of persistent kind of computational resources and so on."},

compute."}, {"time": 11728, "text": "The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation out there in the blockchain world."}, {"time": 11733, "text": "And one of the things that just sort of for fun, so to speak, is we've been doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano, and we'll be doing some more."}, {"time": 11744, "text": "And we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano, which people seem to like quite a bit."}, {"time": 11748, "text": "And one of the things I've realized about NFTs is that there's kind of this notion, and we're really working on this, I like recording stuff."}, {"time": 11761, "text": "You know, one of the things that's come out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history matters type story of, you know, it's not just the current state, it's the history that matters."}, {"time": 11771, "text": "And I've kind of, I don't think this is actually realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm sort of the human who's recorded more about themselves than anybody else."}, {"time": 11777, "text": "And then I end up with these science results that say history matters, which was not those things."},

and having sort of a permanent record of things, one of the things that's kind of interesting there is, you know, you put up a website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it, but you know, you have to keep paying the hosting fees or the thing's going to go away."}, {"time": 11803, "text": "But one of the things about blockchain is quite interesting is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing, you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain, then in a sense, everybody who comes after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain."}, {"time": 11824, "text": "So in a sense with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like if you want to have something permanent, well, at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation, so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that whole collection of transactions that people are going to archive the thing."}, {"time": 11838, "text": "But that means that, you know, pay once and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever."}, {"time": 11843, "text": "And so we've been kind of playing around with sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs and how you and sort of the consumer idea of kind of the it's the it's the anti, you know, it's the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world."}, {"time": 11861, "text": "There's a permanence to it that's heavily incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of history."},

about this kind of physics inspired distributed blockchain, obviously, there, the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no double spends, there's no whatever else, that proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a matter of physics, so to speak."}, {"time": 11900, "text": "And, you know, it's been it's been an interesting thing for the for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving."}, {"time": 11905, "text": "And I don't think anybody's really managed it in an interesting case yet."}, {"time": 11910, "text": "It's a thing that people, you know, aspire to."}, {"time": 11914, "text": "But I think it's a challenging thing because basically, the point is one of the one of the things about proving correctness of something as well."}, {"time": 11919, "text": "You know, people say I've got this program and I'm going to prove it's correct."}, {"time": 11924, "text": "It's like, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 11924, "text": "You have to say what correct means."}, {"time": 11927, "text": "I mean, it's it's kind of like then you have to have another language."}, {"time": 11931, "text": "And people are very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we're going to prove the correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also don't know whether it's correct."}, {"time": 11940, "text": "And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can't crash or it can't scribble on memory."}, {"time": 11946, "text": "But but the thing is that there's this complicated trade off, because as soon as there's as soon as you're really using computation, you have computational irreducibility, you have undecidability."}, {"time": 11955, "text": "If you want to use computation seriously, you have to kind of let go of the

that's kind of the secret that nature has that allows you to make it."}, {"time": 12174, "text": "So that's that part."}, {"time": 12174, "text": "But the bigger picture there was this idea of this kind of computational paradigm, the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations, which have been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300 years."}, {"time": 12186, "text": "And so it was like, look, it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than just equations."}, {"time": 12193, "text": "And, you know, I was saying that in the 1980s and people were, you know, I

was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity that showed up in lots of places."}, {"time": 12294, "text": "And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science."}, {"time": 12294,

audio recording of me sort of saying, people have been talking about, oh, what should this, you know, outfit do?"}, {"time": 12311, "text": "And I was saying, well, there is this thing that I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 12316, "text": "It's this kind of idea of complexity."}, {"time": 12316, "text": "And it's kind of like, and that's what that ended up."}, {"time": 12321, "text": "And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe."}, {"time": 12325, "text": "But I mean, so that, but what's happened then is this idea of complexity and, you know, and I started the first research center at University of Illinois for doing that in the first journal, complex systems and so on."}, {"time": 12335, "text": "And it's kind of an interesting thing in my life, at least that it's kind of like you plant the seed, you have this idea."}, {"time": 12342, "text": "It's a kind of a science idea."}, {"time": 12347, "text": "You have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity."}, {"time": 12347, "text": "The deeper idea was this computational paradigm."}, {"time": 12352, "text": "But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity."}, {"time": 12352, "text":

to some eye rolling, so to speak, because it's kind of like, like, what is, what's actually going on?"}, {"time": 12388, "text": "Well, what people definitely got was this idea of computational models."}, {"time": 12393, "text": "And then they got, but they thought one of the, one of the kind of cognitive mistakes, I think is they say, we've got a computational model and it, and we're looking at a system that's complex and our computational model gives complexity."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "By golly, that must mean it's right."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "And unfortunately, because

do?"}, {"time": 12421, "text": "You know, there's a lot of things that have been sort of done under this banner of complexity."}, {"time": 12426, "text": "And I think it's been very successful in

kind of their flow of money and, and kind of, you know, what happens in different situations and so on."}, {"time": 12476, "text": "So I've been kind of reluctant, but, but I've, I've, I have realized

two ideas, two conceptual ideas that I hadn't really enunciated, I think before."}, {"time": 12566, "text": "One is what I call meta modeling."}, {"time": 12566, "text": "The other is ruleology."},

cellular automaton?"}, {"time": 12580, "text": "You know, what is the underlying stuff underneath that model?"}, {"time": 12585, "text": "And so there's this kind of meta science question of given these models, what is the core model?"}, {"time": 12591, "text": "And I realized, I mean, to me, that's sort of an obvious question, but then I realized I've been doing language design for 40 years

that's a question people haven't tended to ask about models."}, {"time": 12610, "text": "They say, well, we've got this nice model for this and that and the other, what's really underneath it?"}, {"time": 12613, "text": "And what, you know, because once you have the thing that's underneath it, well, for example, this multi computation idea is an ultimate meta modeling idea because it's saying underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure."}, {"time": 12629, "text": "And, you know, you can imagine the same kind of thing in much more sort of much sort of shallower levels in different kinds of modeling."}, {"time": 12636, "text": "So the first activity is this kind of meta modeling, the kind of the models about models, so to speak."}, {"time": 12641, "text": "You know, what is the, what's, you know, drilling down into models?"}, {"time": 12647, "text": "The other thing is this thing that I think we're going to call ruleology, which is kind of the, okay, you've got these simple rules."}, {"time": 12653, "text": "You've got cellular automata, you've got turing machines, you've got substitution systems, you've got register machines, you've got all these different

really like mathematics."}, {"time": 12695, "text": "In fact, from my now understanding of metamathematics, I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level."}, {"time": 12698, "text": "It's not the level that mathematicians have traditionally cared about."}, {"time": 12703, "text": "It's not computer science because computer science is about writing programs that do things, you know, that

surviving field, so to speak."}, {"time": 12722, "text": "It's something where, you know, one of the things I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for example, is you look at mathematics that was

character and kind of an animation and interaction engine on top of it that allowed us to start to create these much more rich experiences."}, {"time": 761, "text": "And a lot of those elements were

explore."}, {"time": 836, "text": "And in fact, we realized pretty quickly that perfection is actually not fun."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Because in a traditional roboticist sense, the first kind of path planner, and this is the part that I worked on out of the gate, was a lot of the AI systems where you have these vehicles and cars racing, making optimal maneuvers to try to get ahead."},

that, obviously, as you can imagine, where, like you said, how big is it?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "How much degrees of freedom?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "What does he look like?"}, {"time": 1006,

"This is the formula for human kind of robot interface more generally, is you almost have this triangle between the physical aspects of it, the mechanics, the industrial design, what's mass producible, the cost constraints and so forth."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "You have the AI side of how do you understand the world around you, interact intelligently with it, execute what you want to execute."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So perceive the environment, make intelligent decisions and move forward."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And then you have the character side of it."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "Most companies have done anything in human robot interaction, really missed the mark or underinvest in the character side of it."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "They overinvest in the mechanical side of it and then varied results on the AI side of it."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And so the thinking is that you put more mechanical flexibility into it, you're going to do better."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "You don't necessarily, you actually create a much higher bar for a high ROI because now your price point goes up, your expectations go up."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And if the AI can't meet it or the overall experience isn't there, you miss the mark."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So how did you, through those conversations, get the cost down so much and made it so simple?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "There's a big theme here because you come from the mecca of robotics, which is Carnegie Mellon University, robotics."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "For all the people I've interacted with that come from there or just from the world experts at robotics, they would never build something like Cosmo."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And so where did that come from?"}, {"time": 1099, "text": "The simplicity."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It came from this combination of a team that we had."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It was quite cool."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "And by the way, you ask anybody that's experienced in the toy entertainment space, you'll never sell a product over $99."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "That was fundamentally false and we believed it to be false."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It was because experience had to meet the mark."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And so we pushed past that amount, but there was a pressure where the higher you go, the more seasonal you become and the tougher it becomes."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And so on the cost side, we very quickly partnered up with some previous contacts that we worked with where, just as an example, our head of mechanical engineering was one of the earliest heads of engineering at Logitech and has a billion units of consumer products and circulation that he's worked on."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So like crazy, low cost, high volume consumer product experience."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "We had a really great mechanical engineering team and just a very practical mindset where we were not going to compromise on feasibility in the market in order to chase something that would be an enabler."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "And we pushed a huge amount of expectations onto the software team where, yes, we're going to use cheap, noisy motors and sensors, but we're going to fix it on the software side."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Then we found on the design and character side, there was a faction that was more from like a game design background that thought that it should be very games driven, Cosmo, where you create a whole bunch of games experiences and it's all about like game mechanics."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And then there was a faction which my cofather and I are the most involved in this, like really believed in, which was character driven."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And the argument is that you will never compete with what you can do virtually from a game standpoint, but you actually on a character side, put this into your wheelhouse and put it more towards your advantage because a physical character has a massively higher impact physically than virtually."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Okay, can I just pause on that because this is so brilliant."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "For people who don't know, Cosmo plays games with you, but there's also a depth of character."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "And I actually, when I was playing with it, I wondered exactly what is the compelling aspect of this."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Because to me, obviously I'm biased, but to me the character, what I enjoyed most, honestly, or what got me to return to it is the character."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "But that's a fascinating discussion of, you're right, ultimately you cannot compete on the quality of the gaming experience."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It's too restrictive."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "The physical world is just too restrictive and you don't have a graphics engine, it's like all this."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "But on the character side, and clearly we moved in that direction as the winning path and we partnered up with this, we immediately went towards Pixar and Carlos Bena had been at Pixar for nine years."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "He'd worked on tons of the movies, including WALLY and others, and just immediately spoke the language and it just clicked on how you think about that magic and drive."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And then we built out a team with him as a really prominent driver of this with different types of backgrounds and animators and character developers where we put these constraints on the team, but then got them to really try to create magic despite that."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And we converged on this system that was at the overlap of character and the character AI that where, if you imagine the dimensionality of emotions, happy, sad, angry, surprised, confused, scared, you think of these extreme emotions."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "We almost put this challenge to populate this library of responses on how do you show the extreme response that goes to the extreme spectrum on angry or frustrated or whatever."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And so that gave us a lot of intuition and learnings and then we started parameterizing them where it wasn't just a fixed recording, but they were parameterized and had randomness to them where you could have infinite permutations of happy and surprised and so forth."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "And then we had a behavioral engine that took the context from the real world and would interpret it and then create probability mappings on what sort of responses you would have that actually made sense."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And so if Cosmo saw you for the first time in a day, he'd be really surprised and happy in the same way that the first time you walk in and your toddler sees you, they're so happy, but they're not going to be that happy for the entirety of your next two hours."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But you have this spike in response or if you leave him alone for too long, he gets bored and starts causing trouble and nudging things off the table."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Or if you beat him in a game, the most enjoyable emotions are him getting frustrated and grumpy to a point where our testers and our customers would be like, I had to let him win because I don't want him to be upset."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And so you start to create this feedback loop where you see how powerful those emotions are."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And just to give you an example, something as simple as eye contact, you don't think about it in a movie."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "It kind of happens like camera angles and so forth, but that's not really a prominent source of interaction."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "What happens when a physical character like Cosmo, when he makes eye contact with you, it built universal kind of connection, kids all the way through adults."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And it was truly universal."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "It was not like people stopped caring after 10, 12 years old."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And so we started doing experiments and we found something as simple as increasing the amount of eye contact, like the amount of times in a minute that he'll look over for your approval to make eye contact."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Just by, I think, doubling it, we increased the playtime engagement by 40%."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "You see these sort of interactions where you build that empathy."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And so we studied pets."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "We studied virtual characters."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "There's like a lot of times actually dogs are one of the most perfect influencers behind these sort of interactions."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And what we realized is that the games were not there to entertain you."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "The games were to create context to bring out the character."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And if you think about the types of games that you played, they're relatively simple, but they were always once to create scenarios of either tension or winning or losing or surprise or whatever the case might be."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And they were purely there to just like create context to where an emotion could feel intelligent and not random."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And in the end, it was all about the character."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So yeah, there's so many elements to play with here."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So you said dogs."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "What lessons do we draw from cats who don't seem to give a damn about you?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "Is that just another character?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It's just another character."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So you could almost like in the early explorations, we thought it would be really incredible if you had a diversity of characters where you almost help encourage which direction it goes, just like in a role playing game."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And you had like think of like the seven dwarves sort of."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And initially we even thought that it would be amazing if like the other like, you know, like their characters actually help them have strengths and weaknesses and some like whatever they end up doing."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Like some are scared, some are, you know, arrogant, some are, you know, super warm and like kind of friendly."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And in the end, we focused on one because it made it very clear that, hey, we got to build out enough depth here because you're kind of trying to expand."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's almost like how long can you maintain a fiction that this character is alive to where the person's explorations don't hit a boundary, which happens almost immediately with typical toys."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And, you know, even with video games, how long can we create that immersive experience to where you expand the boundary?"}, {"time": 1543, "text": "And one of the things we realized is that you're just way more forgiving when something has a personality and it's physical."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "That is the key that unlocks robotics interacting in the physical world and more generally is that when you don't have a personality and you make a mistake as a robot, the stupid robot made a mistake."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why is it not perfect?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "When you have a character and you make a mistake, you have empathy and it becomes endearing and you're way more forgiving."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And that was the key that was like I think goes far, far beyond entertainment."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It actually builds the depth of the personality, the mistakes."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So let me ask the movie Her question then."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "How, so Cosmos seems, feels like the early days of something that will obviously be prevalent throughout society at a scale that we cannot even imagine."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "My sense is it seems obvious that these kinds of characters will permeate society and that we'll be friends with them."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "We'll be interacting with them in different ways."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "I mean, you don't think of it this way, but when you play video games, they're often cold and impersonal."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "But even then, you think about role playing games, you become friends with certain characters in that game."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "They don't remember much about you."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "They're just telling a story."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "It's exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "They exist in that virtual world."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But if they acknowledge that you exist in this physical world, if the characters in the game remember that you exist, that you, like for me, like Lex, they understand that I'm a human being who has like hopes and dreams and so on."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "It seems like there's going to be like billions, if not trillions of Cosmos in the world."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "So if we look at that future, there's several questions to ask."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "How intelligent does that future Cosmo need to be to create fulfilling relationships like friendships?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And part of it is the recognition that it's going to take time to get there because it has to be a lot more intelligent because it was good enough to be a magical experience for an eight year old."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "It's a higher bar to do that, be like a pet in the home or to help with functional interface in an office environment or in a home and so forth."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "And the idea was that you build on that and you kind of get there and as technology becomes more prevalent and less expensive and so forth, you can start to kind of work up to it."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "At the end of the day, we almost equated it to how the touch screen created like this really novel interface to physical kind of devices like this."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "This is the extension of it where you have much richer physical interaction in the real world."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "This is the enabler for it."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And it shows itself in a few kind of really obvious places."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So just take something as simple as a voice assistant."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "You will never, most people will never tolerate an Alexa or a Google Home just starting a conversation proactively when you weren't kind of expecting it because it feels weird."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "It's like you were listening and like, and then now you're kind of, it feels intrusive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "But if you had a character like a cat that touches you and gets your attention or toddler, like you never think twice about it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And what we found really kind of immediately is that these types of characters like Cosmo and they would like roam around and kind of get your attention."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And we had a future version that was always on kind of called Vector."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "People were way more forgiving."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And so you could initiate interaction in a way that is not acceptable for machines."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "And in general, there's a lot of ways to customize it, but it makes people who are skeptical of technology much more comfortable with it."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "There was like, there were a couple of really, really prominent examples of this."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So when we launched in Europe and so we were in I think like a dozen countries, if I remember correctly, but like we went pretty aggressively in launching in Germany and France and UK."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And we were very worried in Europe because there's obviously like a really socially higher bar for privacy and security where you've heard about how many companies have had troubles on things that might've been okay in the US, but like are just not okay in Germany and France in particular."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And so we were worried about this because you have Cosmo who's in our future product Vector, like where you have cameras, you have microphones, it's connected and like you're playing with kids and like in these experiences."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "And you're like, this is like ripe to be like a nightmare if you're not careful."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And the journalists are like notoriously like really, really tough on these sorts of things."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "We were shocked and we prepared so much for what we would have to encounter."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We were shocked in that not once from any journalists or customer did we have any complaints beyond like a really casual kind of question."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And it was because of the character where when the conversation came up, it was almost like, well, of course he has to see and hear."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "How else is he going to be alive and interacting with you?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And it completely disarmed this like fear of technology that enabled this interaction to be much more fluid."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And again, like entertainment was a proving ground, but that is like, you know, there's like ingredients there that carry over to a lot of other elements down the road."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "That's hilarious that we're a lot less concerned about privacy if the thing has value and charisma."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "I mean, that's true for all of human to human interactions."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "It's an understanding of intent where like, well, he's looking at me, he can see me."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "If he's not looking at me, he can't see me."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So it's almost like you're communicating intent."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And with that intent, people are like kind of kind of a more understanding and calmer."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It was just the earliest kind of version of starting to experiment with this."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "But it wasn't an enabler."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "And then you have like completely different dimensions where kids with autism had like an incredible connection with Cosmo that just went beyond anything we'd ever seen."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And we have like these just letters that we would receive from parents."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And we had some research projects kind of going on with some universities on studying this."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "But there's an interesting dimension there that got unlocked that just hadn't existed before that has these really interesting kind of links into society and a potential building block of future experience."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So if you look out into the future, do you think we will have beyond a particular game, you know, a companion like her, like the movie Her or like a Cosmo that's kind of asks you how your day went to write, you know, like a friend."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "How many years away from that do you think we are?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So I think the idea of a different type of character, like more closer to like kind of a pet style companionship will come way faster."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And there's a few reasons."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "One is like to do something like in her, that's like effectively almost general AI."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And the bar is so high that if you miss it by a bit, you hit the uncanny valley where it just becomes creepy and like and not appealing."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Because the closer you try to get to a human in form and interface and voice, the harder it becomes."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Whereas you have way more flexibility on still landing a really great experience if you embrace the idea of a character."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And that's why one of the other reasons why we didn't have a voice and also why like a lot of video game characters like Sims, for example, does not have a voice when you when you think about it, it was it wasn't just a cost savings like for them."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was actually for all of these purposes."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was because when you have a voice, you immediately narrow down the appeal to some particular demographic or age range or kind of style or gender."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "If you don't have a voice, people interpret what they want to interpret."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And an eight year old might get a very different interpretation than a 40 year old, but you create a dynamic range."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And so you just you can lean into these advantages much more in something that doesn't resemble human."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "And so that'll come faster."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "I don't know when a human like that's just still like just complete R&D at this point."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "The chat interfaces are getting way more interesting and richer, but it's still a long way to go to kind of pass the test of, you know."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Well, let me like let's consider like let me play devil's advocate."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So Google is a very large company that's servicing."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "It's creating a very compelling product that wants to provide a service to a lot of people."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "But let's go outside of that."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "You said characters."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Yeah, it feels like and you also said that it requires general intelligence to be a successful participant in a relationship, which could explain why I'm single."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "But the I honestly want to push back on that a little bit because I feel like is it possible that if you're just good at playing a character in a movie, there's a bunch of characters."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "If you just understand what creates compelling characters and then you just are that character and you exist in the world and other people find you and they connect with you just like you do when you talk to somebody at a bar."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "I like this character."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "This character is kind of shady."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "I don't like them."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "You pick the ones that you like."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And, you know, maybe it's somebody that's reminds you of your father or mother."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "I don't know what it is, but the Freudian thing."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "But there's some kind of connection that happens and that's the Cosmo you connect to."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "That's the future Cosmo you connect."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And it's so I guess the statement I'm trying to make, is it possible to achieve a depth of friendship without solving general intelligence?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "And it's about intelligent kind of constraints, right?"}, {"time": 2127, "text": "And just you set expectations and constraints such that in the space that's left, you can be successful."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And so you can do that by having a very focused domain that you can operate in."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "For example, you're a customer support agent for a particular product and you create intelligence and a good interface around that."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Or, you know, kind of in the personal companionship side, you can't be everything across the board."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "You kind of solve those constraints."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And I think it's possible."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "My worry is right now I don't see anybody that has picked up on where Cosmo left off and is pushing on it in the same way."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And so I don't know if it's a sort of thing where similar to like how, you know, in Dotcom there were all these concepts that we considered like, you know, that didn't work out or like failed or like were too early or whatnot."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And then 20 years later, you have these like incredible successes on almost the same concept."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "Like it might be that sort of thing where like there's another pass at it that happens in five years or in 10 years."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "But it does feel like that appreciation of that, like the three legged stool, if you will, between like, you know, the hardware, the AI and the character, that balance, it's hard to, I'm not aware of anywhere right now where like that same kind of aggressive drive with the value on the character is happening."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And so to me, just a prediction, exactly as you said, something that looks awfully a lot like Cosmo, not in the actual physical form, but in the three legged stool, something like that in some number of years will be a trillion dollar company."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Like, it's obvious to me that like character, not just as robotic companions, but in all our computers, they'll be there."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "It's like Clippy was like two legs of that stool or something like that."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "I mean, those are all different attempts."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "And what's really confusing to me is they're born these attempts and everybody gets excited and for some reason they die and then nobody else tries to pick it up."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "And then maybe a few years later, a crazy guy like you comes around with just enough brilliance and vision to create this thing and is born."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "A lot of people love it."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "A lot of people get excited, but maybe the timing is not right yet."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And then when the timing is right, it just blows up."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "It just keeps blowing up more and more until it just blows up."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "And I guess everything in the full span of human civilization collapses eventually."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "And that wouldn't surprise me at all."},

mobile devices and computation is going to become more and more prevalent as well as cloud as a big tool to offload cost."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "AI is going to be a massive transformation compared to what we dealt with where everything from voice understanding to just kind of a broader contextual understanding and mapping of semantics and understanding scenes and so forth."}, {"time": 2315,

"And you have just the brilliance of the tapping and animation and these other areas where that was a big unlock in film, obviously."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so I think, yeah, the pieces can reconnect and the building blocks are actually going to be way more impressive than they were five years ago."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So in 2019, Anki, the company that created Cosmo, the company that you started, had to shut down."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "How did you feel at that time?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "That was a really emotional stretch and it was a really tough year."}, {"time":

downs and barriers."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And the thing that made it, just sort of winding a tiny bit, what ended up being really challenging about it as a business is from a commercial

brutal."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "You don't think about this when you're starting a company or when you have a few million in revenue because it's just your biggest costs are kind of just your

on."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "That's what you're raising money on."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "But there is no path to kind of pure profitability just there because it was such specific type of price

were doing."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "There was just a huge amount of pride there."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And then we wanted to see it through."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And we felt like we had a shot to kind of get through these checkpoints."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And by brutal, I mean literally days of cash, like three, four different times runway in the year kind of before it where

it happened, but it was just very emotional where we announced it finally that we basically were just watching the runway and trying to kind of time it."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And when we realized

down crying at the hands and somebody else had to step in for a bit and it was just very, very emotional."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "But the beautiful part is afterwards, everybody stayed at the office to two, three in the morning just drinking and hanging out and telling stories and celebrating."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And it was just one of the best, for many people, it was the best kind of work experience that they had."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And there was a lot of pride in what we did."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And it wasn't anything obvious we could point to that like, hey, if only we had done that different, things would have been completely different."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "It was just like the physics didn't line up."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "And but the experience was pretty incredible, but it was hard."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It had this feeling that there was this incredible beauty in both the technology and products and the team that there's a lot there that in the right context could have been pretty incredible, but it was emotional."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Yeah, just thinking, I mean, just looking at this company, like you said, product and technology, but the vision, the implementation, you got the cost down very low and the compelling, the nature of the product was great."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So many robotics companies failed at this."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "The robot was too expensive."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "It didn't have the personality."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "It didn't really provide any value, like a

you before that happened or not, but I remember, you know, I'm distant from this."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "I remember being heartbroken reading that because, like, if if Cosmo is not going to succeed, what is going to succeed?"}, {"time": 2749, "text": "Because that to me was incredible."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "Like it was an incredible idea."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "Cost is down."},

this must have failed because it's obviously not like, yeah, it's business."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Maybe it's some aspect of the manufacturing and so on."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "But I'm now realizing it's also not just that it's."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And sales, marketing, all those everything."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Like, how do you explain something that's like a new category to people that like how all these positions."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And so, like, you know, it had some of the hardest elements of if you were to pick a business, it had some of the hardest

having like this dual prong marketing challenge."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "You have manufacturing, you have like really high precision on the components that you need."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "You have the challenges."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "So there were a lot of tough elements."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "But is this feeling where like just really great alignment of unique strength across kind of like all these different areas, just an incredible like, you know, kind of character and animation team between this Carlos."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And there's like a character director day that came on board and really great people there."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "The A.I."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "side, the the manufacturing, the you know, where like never missing a launch."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "And actually, you know, he kind of had that quality was."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Yeah, it was heartbreaking."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "But here's one neat thing is like we we had so much like fan mail from kind of kids and parents like I actually like there was a bunch that collected in the end that I actually saved."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And like I never it was too emotional to open it and I still haven't opened it."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And so I actually have this giant envelope of like a stack this much of like letters from, you know, kids and families, just like every kind of permutation permutation you can imagine."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And so planning to kind of I don't know, maybe like a five year, you know, five year, some year reunion, just inviting everybody over and we'll just like kind of dig into it and kind of bring back some memories."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "But, you know, good impact."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And well, I think there will be companies, maybe Waymo and Google will be somehow involved that will carry this flag forward and will will make you proud whether you're involved or not."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "I think this is one of the greatest robotics companies in the history of robotics."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "So you should be proud."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It's still tragic to know that, you know, because you read all the stories of Apple and let's see, SpaceX and like companies that were just on the verge of failure several times through that story."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And they just it's almost like a roll of the dice."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "They succeeded."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And here's a roll of the dice that just happened to go."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "And that's the appreciation that like when you really like talk to a lot of the founders, like everybody goes through those moments."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "And sometimes it really is a matter of like, you know, timing, a little bit of luck, like some things are just out of your control."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "And and you get a much deeper appreciation for just the dimensionality of that challenge."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "But the great thing is, is that like a lot of the team actually like stayed together."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "And so there were actually a couple of companies that we where we kind of kept big chunks of the team together and we actually kind of helped align this, you know, to to help people out as well."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And one of them was Waymo, where a majority of the AI and robotics team actually had the exact background that you would look for."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And like kind of AV space was a space that a lot of us like, you know, you know, worked on in grad school, were always passionate about and ended up, you know, maybe the time, you know, serendipitous timings from another perspective where like kind of landed in a really unique circumstances that should have been quite exciting, too."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "So it's interesting to ask you just your thoughts."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Cosmo still lives on under Dream Labs, I think."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Is that, are you tracking the progress there or is it too much pain?"}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Is it, are you, is that something that you're excited to see where that goes?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "So keeping an eye on it, of course, just out of curiosity and obviously just kind of careful product line, I think it's deceptive how complex it is to manufacture and evolve that product line and the amount of experiences that are required to complete the picture and be able to move that forward."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And I think that's going to make it pretty hard to do something really substantial with it."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "It would be cool if like even the product in the way it was was able to be manufactured."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "Which is the current goal, I suppose."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "Yeah, which will be neat."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "But I think it's deceptive how tricky that is on like everything from the quality control, the details and then like technology changes that forces you to reinvent and update certain things."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "So I haven't been super close to it, but just kind of keeping an eye on it."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Yeah, it's really interesting how it's deceptively difficult, just as you're saying."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "For example, those same folks, and I've spoken with them, they're, they partner up with Rick and Morty creators to do the Butter Robot."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "I just recently, I kind of half ass watched Rick and Morty previously, but now I just watched like the first season."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "It's such a brilliant show."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "I like, I did not understand how brilliant that show is."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "And obviously I think in season one is where the Butter Robot comes along for just a few minutes or whatever, but I just fell in love with the Butter Robot."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "The sort of the, that particular character, just like you said, there's characters you can create, personalities you can create, and that particular robot who's doing a particular task realizes, you know, this like realizes, that's the existential question."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "The myth of Sisyphus question that Camus writes about, is this all there is?"},

particular task."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "It's humor of course, it's darkness, it's a beautiful mix."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "But so they want to release that Butter Robot, but something tells me that to do the same depth of personality as Cosmo had, the same richness, it would be on the manufacturing, on the AI, on the storytelling, on the design, it's going to be very, very difficult."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "It could be a cool sort of toy for Rick and Morty fans, but to create the same depth of existential angst that the Butter Robot symbolizes is really, that's the brave effort you succeeded at with Cosmo, but it's not easy."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "You can fail on almost any one of the kind of dimensions, and unique convergence of a lot of different skill sets to try to pull that off."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "On this topic, let me ask you for some advice, because as I've been watching Rick and Morty, I told myself, I have to build the Butter Robot, just as a hobby project."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "And so I got a nice platform for it with treads and there's a camera that moves up and down and so on."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "But the question I'd like to ask, there's obvious technical questions I'm fine with, communication, the personality, storytelling, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "I think I understand the process of that, but how do you know when you got it right?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "So with Cosmo, how did you know this is great?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Or something is off."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Is this brainstorming with the team?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Do you know it when you see it?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Is it like love at first sight?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "It's like, this is right."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Or I guess if we think of it as an optimization space, is there Uncanny Valley where you're like, that's not right, or this is right, or are a lot of characters right?"}, {"time": 3268, "text": "Yeah, we stayed away from Uncanny Valley just by having such a different mapping where it didn't try to look like a dog or a human or anything like that."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And so you avoided having a weird pseudo similarity, but not quite hitting the mark."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "But you could just fall flat where just a personality or a character emotion just didn't feel right."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "And so it actually mirrored very closely to the iterations that a character director at Pixar would have, where you're running through it and you can virtually see what it'll look like."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "We created a plugin to where we actually used Maya, the animation tools, and then we created a plugin that perfectly matched it to the physical one."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And so you could test it out virtually and then push a button and see it physically play out."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And there's subtle differences."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And so you want to make sure that that feedback loop is super easy to be able to test it live."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then sometimes you would just feel it that it's right and intuitively know."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then we did user testing."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "But it was very, very often that if we found it magical, it would scale and be magical more broadly."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "There were not too many cases where we were pretty decent about not geeking out or getting too attached to something that was super unique to us, but trying to put a customer hat on and does it truly feel magical?"}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, we just give a lot of autonomy to the character team to really think about the character board and mood boards and storyboards and what's the background of this character and how would they react."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "And they went through a process that's actually pretty familiar, but now had to operate under these unique constraints."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "The moment where it felt right kind of took a fairly similar journey than like as a character in an animated film."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Actually, it's quite cool."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Well, the thing that's really important to me and I wonder if it's possible."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Well, I hope it's possible."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Pretty sure it's possible is for me, even though I know how it works to make sure there's sufficient randomness in the process."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "Probably because it would be machine learning based that I'm surprised that I don't."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "I'm surprised by certain reactions."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "I'm surprised by certain communication."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Maybe that's in a form of a question."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Were you surprised by certain things Cosmo did, like certain interactions?"}, {"time": 3412, "text": "Yeah, we made it intentionally so that there would be some surprise and a decent amount of variability in how he'd respond in certain circumstances."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And so in the end, this isn't general AI."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "This is a giant spectrum and library of parameterized emotional responses and an emotional engine that would map your current state of the game, your emotions, the world, the people who are playing with you, so forth, to what's happening."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "But we could make it feel spontaneous by creating enough diversity and randomness, but still within the bounds of what felt like very realistic to make that work."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And then what was really neat is that we could get statistics on how much of that space we were saturating and then add more animations and more diversity in the places that would get hit more often so that you stay ahead of the curve and maximize the chance that it stays feeling alive."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "But then when you combine it, the permutations and the combinations of emotions stitched together sometimes surprised us because you see them in isolation."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "But when you actually see them and you see them live relative to some event that happened in the game or whatnot, it was kind of cool to see the combination of the two."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "And it's not too different in other robotics applications where you get so used to thinking about the modules of a system and how things progress through a tech stack that the real magic is when all the pieces come together and you start getting the right emergent behavior in a way that's easy to lose when you just kind of go too deep into any one piece of it."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "Yeah, when the system is sufficiently complex, there is something like emergent behavior and that's where the magic is."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "As a human being, you can still appreciate the beauty of that magic at the system level."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "First of all, thank you for humoring me on this."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "It's really, really fascinating."},

to communicate so much with just movement and face."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "Do you think speech is too much of a degree of freedom?"}, {"time": 3526, "text": "Like speech a feature or a bug of deep interaction, emotional interaction?"}, {"time": 3550, "text": "For a product, it's too deep right now."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "You would immediately break the fiction because the state of the art is just not good enough."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And that's on top of just narrowing down the demographic where the way you speak to an adult versus the way you speak to a child is very different."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "Yet a dog is able to appeal to everybody."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "And so right now there is no speech system that is rich enough and subtly realistic enough to feel appropriate."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "And so we very, very quickly kind of moved away from it."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "Now, speech understanding is a different matter where understanding intent, that's a really valuable input."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "But giving it back requires like a way, way higher bar given kind of where today's world is."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "And so that realization that you can do surprisingly much with either no speech or kind of tonal like the way Wally R2D2 and kind of other characters are able to, it's quite powerful and it generalizes across cultures and across ages really, really well."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "I think we're going to be in that world for a little while where it's still very much an unsolved problem on how to like make something."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "It touches on the uncanny valley thing."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So if you have legs and you're a big humanoid looking thing, you have very different expectations and a much narrower degree of what's going to be acceptable by society."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And then if you're a robot like Cosmo or Wally or some other form where you can kind of like reinvent the character, speech has that same property where speech is so well understood in terms of expectations by humans that you have far less flexibility on how to deviate from that and lean into your strengths and avoid weaknesses."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "But I wonder if there is, obviously there's certain kinds of speech that activates the uncanny valley and breaks the illusion faster."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So I guess my intuition is we will solve certain, we would be able to create some speech based personalities sooner than others."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So for example, I could think of a robot that doesn't know English and is learning English, right?"}, {"time": 3673, "text": "Those kinds of personalities."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "It's like a fiction where you're intentionally kind of like getting a toddler level of speech."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So that's exactly right."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So you can have like tied into the experience where it is a more limited character or you embrace the lack of emotions or the lack of dynamic range in the speech kind of capabilities, emotions as like part of the character itself."}, {"time":

with like, I don't know, I guess like data and some of the other ones."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "But yeah, so you have to, and that becomes a constraint that lets you meet the bar."}, {"time": 3721,

certain aspects."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "So if you modify human behavior, like, so forget the sort of artificial thing where you don't know English toddler thing."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "We, if

{"time": 3794, "text": "And that's why like you have these big pushes that like for most of the last decade plus like where you'd have like full like human replicas of robots really being down to like skin and like kind of in some places."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "My personal feeling is like, man, like that's not the direction that's most fruitful right now."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "Beautiful art."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "It's not in terms of a rich, deep, fulfilling experience."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "And creating a minefield of potential places to feel off."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "And then you're sidestepping where like the biggest kind of functional AI challenges are to actually have, you know, kind of like really rich productivity that actually kind of justifies the higher price points."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "And that's part of the challenge is like, yeah, like robots are going to get to like thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars and so forth."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "But you can imagine what sort of expectation of value that comes with it."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "And so that's where you want to be able to invest the time and depth."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "And so going down the full human replica route creates a gigantic distraction and really, really high bar that can end up sucking up so much of your resources."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "So it's weird to say, but you happen to be one of the greatest at this point roboticists ever because you created this little guy."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Your part obviously of a great team that created the little guy with a deep personality."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "And they're now switching to an entirely, well, maybe not entirely, but a different fascinating, impactful robotics problem, which is autonomous driving and more specifically, the biggest version of autonomous driving, which is autonomous trucking."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "So you are at Waymo now."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "Can you give us a big picture overview?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "What is Waymo?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "What is Waymo Driver?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "What is Waymo One?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "What is Waymo Via?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "Can you give an overview of the company and the vision behind the company?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "Waymo, by the way, has been eye opening on just how incredible the people and the talent is and how in one company you almost have to create 30 companies worth of technology and capability to solve the full spectrum of it."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "So I've been at Waymo since 2019, so about two and a half years."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "So Waymo is focused on building what we call a driver, which is creating the ability to have autonomous driving across different environments, vehicle platforms, domains, and use cases."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "As you know, it got started in 2009."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "It was almost like an immediate successor to the Grand Challenge and Urban Challenges that were like incredible catalysts for this whole space."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And so Google started this project and then eventually Waymo spun out."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And so what Waymo is doing is creating the systems, both hardware, software, infrastructure, everything that goes into it to enable and to commercialize autonomous driving."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "This hits on consumer transportation and ride sharing and kind of vehicles and urban environments."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "And as you mentioned, it hits on autonomous trucking to transport goods."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "So in a lot of ways, it's transporting people and transporting goods."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "But at the end of the day, the underlying capabilities required to do that are surprisingly better aligned than one might expect, where it's the fundamentals of being able to understand the world around you, process it, make intelligent decisions, and prove that we are at a level of safety that enables large scale autonomy."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "So from a branding perspective, Waymo Driver is the system that's irrespective of a particular vehicle it's operating in."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "You have a set of sensors that perceive the world, can act in that world, and move whatever the vehicle is through the world."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And so in the same way that you have a driver's license and your ability to drive is tied to a particular make and model of a car, and of course, there are special licenses for other types of vehicles, but the fundamentals of a human driver very, very largely carry over."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And then there's uniquenesses related to a particular environment or domain or a particular vehicle type that kind of add some extra additive challenges."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "But that's exactly right."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "It's the underlying systems that enable a physical vehicle without a human driver to very successfully accomplish the task that previously wasn't possible without 100% human driving."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And then there's Waymo One, which is the transporting people from a brand perspective."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And just in case we refer to it so people know."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And then there's Waymo Via, which is the trucking component."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "Why Via, by the way?"}, {"time": 4074, "text": "Is it just like a cool sounding name?"}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Is there an interesting story there?"}, {"time": 4094, "text": "It is a pretty cool sounding name."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "It's a cool sounding name."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "I mean, when you think about it, it's just like, well, we're going to transport it via this and that."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "So it's just kind of like an allusion to the mechanics of transporting something."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And it is a pretty good grouping."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And the interesting thing is that even the groupings kind of blur where Waymo One is like human transportation and there's a fully autonomous service in the Phoenix area that like every day is transporting people."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And it's pretty incredible to like just see that operated reasonably large scale and just kind of happen."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "And then on the Via side, it doesn't even have to be like long haul trucking is a like a major focus of ours."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "But down the road, you can stitch together the vehicle transportation as well for local delivery."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "Also, and a lot of this requirements for local delivery overlap very heavily with consumer transportation."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Obviously, given that you're operating on a lot of the same roads and navigating the same safety challenges."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And Waymo very much is a multi product company that has ambitions in both."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "They have different challenges and both are tremendous opportunities."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But the cool thing is, is that there's a huge amount of leverage and this kind of core technology stack now gets pushed on by both sides."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And that adds its own unique challenges."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But the success case is that the challenges that you push on, they get leveraged across all platforms and all."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "From an engineer perspective, the teams are integrated."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "It's a mix."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "So there's a huge amount of centralized kind of core teams that support all applications."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And so you think of something like the hardware team that develops the lasers to compute integrates into vehicle platforms."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "This is an experience that carries over across, you know, any application that we'd have in a ebb and flow with both."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Then there's like really unique perception challenges, planning challenges, like other types of challenges where there's a huge amount of leverage on a core tech stack."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "But then there's like dedicated teams that think of how do you deal with a unique challenge, for example, an articulated trailer with varying loads that completely changes the physical dynamics of a vehicle that doesn't exist on a car, but it becomes one of the most important kind of unique new challenges on a truck."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "So what's the long term dream of Waymo via the autonomous trucking effort that Waymo is doing?"}, {"time": 4237, "text": "Yeah, so we're starting with developing L4 autonomy for class 8 trucks."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "These are 53 foot trailers that capture like a pretty sizable percentage of the goods transportation in the country."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Long term, the opportunity is obviously to expand to much more diverse types of vehicles, types of goods transportation and start to really expand in both the volume and the route feasibility that's possible."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "And so just like we did on the car side, you start with a single route with a very specific operating kind of domain and constraints that allow you to solve the problem."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "But then over time, you start to really try to push against those boundaries and open up deeper feasibility across routes, across surface streets, across environmental conditions, across the type of goods that you carry, the versatility of those goods and how little supervision is necessary to just start to scale this network."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "And long term, there's actually it's a pretty incredible enabler where today you have already a giant shortage of truck drivers."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "It's over 80,000 truck driver shortage that's expected to grow to hundreds of thousands in the years ahead."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "You have really, really quickly increasing demand from ecommerce and just distribution of where people are located."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "You have one of the deepest safety challenges of any profession in the US where there's a huge, huge, huge kind of challenge around fatigue and around kind of the long routes that are driven."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And even beyond kind of the cost and necessity of it, there are fundamental constraints built into our logistics network that are tied to the type of human constraints and regulatory constraints that are tied to trucking today."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "For example, our limits on how long a driver can be driving in a single day before they're not allowed to drive anymore, which is a very important safety constraint."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "What that does is it enforces limitations on how far jumps with a single driver could be and makes you very subject to availability of drivers, which influences where warehouses are built, which influences how goods are transported, which influences costs."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Yeah, I had to be published before this had a great conversation with Steve Vicelli, who we talked about the manual driving."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "He echoed many of the same things that you were talking about, but we talked about much of the fascinating human stories of truck drivers."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "He was also was a truck driver for a bit as a grad student to try to understand the depth of the problem."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "Fascinating lives."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "We have some drivers that have four million miles of lifetime driving experience."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "It's pretty incredible."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And yeah, it's learning from them, like some of them are on the road for 300 days a year."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "It's a very unique type of lifestyle."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "So there's fascinating stuff there."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "Just like you said, there's a shortage of actually people, truck drivers taking the job, counter to what I think is publicly believed."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "So there's an excess of jobs and a shortage of people to take up those jobs."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And just like you said, it's such a difficult problem."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "And these are experts at driving and solving this particular problem."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "And it's fascinating to learn from them to understand, you know, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 4461, "text": "And that's the question I want to ask you from a perception, from a robotics perspective."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "What's your sense of how difficult is autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 4469, "text": "Maybe you can comment on which scenarios are super difficult, which are more manageable."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "Is there is there a way to kind of convert into words how difficult the problem is?"}, {"time": 4480, "text": "So there's and as you can expect, it's a mix."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Some things become a lot easier or at least more flexible."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "Some things are harder."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so, you know, on the things that are like the tailwinds, the benefits, a big focus of automating trucking, especially initially, is really focusing on the long haul freeway stretch of it, where that's where a majority of the value is captured."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "On a freeway, you have a lot more structure and a lot more consistency across freeways across the U.S. compared to surface streets where you have a way higher dimensionality of what can happen, lack of structure, lack of consistency and variability across cities."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "So you can leverage that consistency to tackle, at least in that respect, a more constrained problem, which has some benefits to it."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "You can itemize much more of the sort of things you might encounter and so forth."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "And so those are benefits."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Is there a canonical freeway and city we should be thinking about?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Like, is there is there a standard thing that's brought up in conversation often?"}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Like, here's a stretch of road."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "What is it like when people talk about traveling across country, they'll talk about New York, San Francisco."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Is that the route?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Like, is there a stretch of road that's like nice and clean and then there's like cities with difficulties in them that you kind of think of as the canonical problem to solve here?"}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So starting with the car side."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "Well, Waymo very intentionally picked the Phoenix area and the San Francisco area as a follow."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "Once we hit driverless, where when you think of consumer transportation and ride sharing kind of economy, a big percentage of that market is captured in the densest cities in the United States."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And so really pushing out and solving San Francisco becomes a really huge opportunity and importance and places one dot on kind of like the spectrum of complexity."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "The Phoenix area, starting with Chandler and then expanding more broadly in the Phoenix metropolitan area, it's I believe the fastest growing city in the US."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It's a kind of a higher medium sized city, but growing quickly and still captures a really wide range of kind of complexities."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "And so getting to driverless there actually exposes you to a lot of the building blocks you need for the more complicated environments."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, there's a thesis that if you start to kind of place a few of these kind of dots where San Francisco has these types of unique challenges, dense pedestrians, all this like complexity, especially when you get into the downtown areas and so forth."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "And Phoenix has like a really interesting kind of spectrum of challenges, maybe other ones like LA kind of add freeway focus and so forth."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "You start to kind of cover the full set of features that you might expect and it becomes faster and faster if you have the right systems and the right organization to then open up the fifth city and the 10th city and the 20th city."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "On trucking, there's similar properties where obviously there's uniquenesses and freeways when you get into really dense environments and then the real opportunity to then get even more valuous to think about how you expand with like some of the surface free challenges."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "But for example, right now we're looking we have a big facility that we're finishing building in Q1 in Dallas area."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "That'll allow us to do testing from the Dallas area on routes like Dallas to Houston, Dallas to Phoenix, going out east."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Dallas to Austin."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Austin to that triangle."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "Waymo should come to Austin."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Well, Waymo the car side wasn't Austin for a while."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "Come back."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "But trucking is actually, Texas is one of the best places to start because of both volume, regulatory weather, there's a lot of benefits."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "On trucking, a huge opportunity is Port of LA going east."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "So in a lot of ways, a lot of the work is to start to stitch together a network and converge to Port of LA where you have the biggest port in the United States."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And the amount of goods going east from there is pretty tremendous."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And then obviously, there's, you know, kind of channels everywhere."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And then you have extra complexities as you get into like snow and increment weather and so forth."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "But what's interesting about trucking is every single route segment that you add increases the value of the whole network."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And so it has this kind of network effect and cumulative effect that's very unique."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And so there's all these dimensions that we think about."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, Dallas is a really unique hub that opens up a lot of options has become a really valuable lever."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So the million questions I could ask you, first of all, you mentioned level four."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "For people who totally don't know, there's these levels of automation that level four refers to kind of the first step that you could recognize as fully autonomous driving."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "Level five is really fully autonomous driving and level four is kind of fully autonomous driving."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "And then there are specific definitions, depending on who you ask what that actually means."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "But for you, what does the level four mean?"}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And you mentioned freeway."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "Let's say like there's three parts of long haul trucking."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Maybe I'm wrong in this, but there's freeway driving."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "There's like truck stop."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "And then there's more urban type of area."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "So which of those do you want to tackle?"}, {"time": 4794, "text": "Which of them do you include under level four?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "Like how do you think about this problem?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "What do you focus on?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "What is the biggest impact to be had in the short term?"}, {"time": 4805, "text": "So the goal is that we got to get to market as fast as we can, because the moment you get to market, you just learn so much and it influences everything that you do."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "And it is one of the experiences I carried over from before is that you add constraints."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "You figure out the right compromises."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "You do whatever it takes because getting to market is so critical."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "But here with autonomous driving, you can get to market in so many different ways."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "And so one of the simplifications that we intentionally have put on is using what we call transfer hubs, where you can imagine depots that are at the entry points to metropolitan areas, like let's say Dallas, like the hub that we're building, which does a few things that are very valuable."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "So from a first product standpoint, you can automate transfer hub to transfer hub."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "And that path from the transfer hub to the full freeway route can be a very intentional single route that you can select for the features that you feel you want to handle at that point in time."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "And you build the hub specifically designed for autonomous trucking."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And that's what's going to happen, actually."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And you need to come out in January and check it out because it's going to be really cool."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Not only is it our main operating headquarters for our fleet there, but it will be the first fully ground up designed driverless hub for autonomous trucks in terms of where do they enter, where do they depart, how do you think about the flow of people, goods, everything."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "It's quite cool and it's really beautiful on how it's thought through."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "And so early on, it is totally reasonable to do the last five miles manually to get to the final kind of depot to avoid having to solve the general surface street problem, which is obviously very complex."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "Now, when the time comes and we are increasingly, already we're pushing on some of this, but we will increasingly be pushing on surface street capabilities to build out the value chain to go all the way depot to depot instead of transfer hub to transfer hub."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "And we have probably the best advantages in the world because of all the Waymo experience on surface streets, but that's not the highest ROI right now where the highest ROI is hub to hub and get the routes going."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And so when you ask what's L4, L4 can be applied to any operating domain or scope, but it's effectively for the places where we say we're ready for autonomous operation."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "We are 100% operating as a self driving truck with no human behind the wheel."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "That is L4 autonomy."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And it doesn't mean that you operate in every condition, it doesn't mean you operate on every road, but for a particularly well defined area, operating conditions, routes, kind of domain, you are fully autonomous."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And that's the difference between L4 and L5."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And most people would agree that at least anytime in the foreseeable future, L5 is just not even really worth thinking about because there's always going to be these extremes."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "And so it's a race and almost like a game where you think of what is the sequence of expanded capabilities that create the most value and teach us the most and create this feedback loop where we're building out and unlocking more and more capability over time."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "I gotta ask you, just curious."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "So first of all, I have to, when I'm allowed, visit the Dallas facility because it's super cool."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "It's like robot on the giving and the receiving end."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "The truck is a robot and the hub is a robot."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Yeah, it's got to be very robot friendly."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "I will feel at home."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "What's the sensor suite like on the hub if you can just high level mention it?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Does the hub have like lidars?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Is the truck doing most of the intelligence or is the hub also intelligent?"}, {"time": 5020, "text": "Yeah, so most of it will be the truck and everything is like connected."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "So we have our servers where we know exactly where every truck is."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "We know exactly what's happening at a hub."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "And so you can imagine like a large backend system that over time starts to manage timings, goods, delivery, windows, all these sort of things."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "And so you don't actually need to, there might be special cases where that is valuable to equip some sensors in the hub, but a majority of the intelligence is going to be on the truck because whatever's relevant to the truck, relevant should be seen by the truck and can be relayed remotely for any sort of kind of cognizance or decision making."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "But there's a distinct type of workflow where do you check trucks?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Where do you want them to enter?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "What if there's many operating at once?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Where's the staging area to depart?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "How do you set up the flow of humans and human cars and traffic so that you minimize the interaction between humans and kind of self driving trucks?"}, {"time": 5078, "text": "And then how do you even intelligently select the locations of these transfer hubs that are both really great service locations for a metropolitan area?"}, {"time": 5078, "text": "And there could be over time, many of them for a metropolitan area while at the same time leaning into the path of least resistance to lean into your current capabilities and strengths so that you minimize the amount of work that's necessary to unlock the next kind of big bar."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "I have a million questions."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So first, is the goal to have no human in the truck?"}, {"time": 5106, "text": "The goal is to have no human in the truck."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "Now, of course, right now we're testing with expert operators and so forth."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But the goal is to... Now, there might be circumstances where it makes sense to have a human or... And obviously, these trucks can also be manually driven."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So sometimes we talk with our fleet partners about how you can buy a Waymo equipped Dymor truck down the road and on the routes that are autonomous, it's autonomous."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "On the routes that are not, it's human driven."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "Maybe there's L2 functionality that adds safety systems and so forth."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "But as soon as they become, as soon as we expand in software, the availability of driverless routes, the hardware is forward compatible to just now start using them in real time."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And so you can imagine this mixed use."}, {"time": 5151, "text": "But at the end of the day, the largest value proposition is where you're able to have no constraints on how you can operate this truck."}, {"time": 5151, "text": "And it's 100% autonomous with nobody inside."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So the... Let me ask on the logistics front, because you mentioned that also opportunity to revamp or for build from scratch some of the ideas around logistics."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "I don't want to throw too much shade, but from talking to Steve, my understanding is logistics is not perhaps as great as it could be in the current trucking environment."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "I'm not, maybe you can break down why, but there's probably competing companies."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "There's just a mess."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "Maybe some of it is literally just, it's old school."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "Like they, it's just like, it's not computer, it's not computerized."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "Like truckers are almost like contractors."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "There's an independence and there's not a nice interface where they can communicate where they're going, where they're at, you know, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "And so there, it just feels like there's so much opportunity to digitize everything to where you could optimize the use of human time, optimize the use of all kinds of resources."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "How much are you thinking about that problem?"}, {"time": 5217, "text": "How fascinating is that problem?"}, {"time": 5223, "text": "How much opportunity is there to revolutionize the space of logistics in autonomous trucking, in trucking period?"}, {"time": 5229, "text": "It's pretty fascinating."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "It's one of the most motivating aspects of all this where like, yes, there's like a mountain of problems that are like you want to, you have to solve to get to like the first checkpoints and first drivers and so forth."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "And inevitably, like in a space like this, you plug in initially into the existing kind of system and start to kind of, you know, learn and iterate."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "But that opportunity is massive."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "And so, you know, a couple of the factors that play into it."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "So first of all, there's obviously just the physical constraints of driving time, driver availability."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "Some fleets have a 95% attrition rate, you know, right now because of just this demands and like, you know, kind of gaps in competition and so forth."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "And then it's also incredibly fragmented where you would be shocked at like when you look at industries, like when you think of the top 10 players, like the biggest fleets, like the Walmarts and FedExes and so forth."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "The percentage of the overall trucking market that's captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is surprisingly small."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "The average kind of truck operation is like a one to five truck, you know, family business."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "And so and so there's just like a huge amount of like fragmentation, which makes for really interesting challenges in kind of stitching together through like bulletin boards and brokerages and some people run their own fleets."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "And this world's kind of like evolving, but it is one of the less digitized and optimized worlds that there is."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "And the part that is optimized is optimized to the constraints of today."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "And even within the constraints of today, this is a 900 billion dollar industry in the US and it's continuing to grow."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "It feels like from a business perspective, if I were to predict that while trying to solve the autonomous trucking problem, Waymo might solve first the logistics problem because that would already be a huge impact."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So on the way to solving autonomous trucking, the human driven, like there's so much opportunity to significantly improve the human driven trucking, the timing, the logistics."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So you use humans optimally."}, {"time": 5354, "text": "You use handoffs to like, you know, well, even you get really ambitious, you start to expand this beyond like how does the fulfillment center work and like how does the transfer hub work, how does the warehouse work?"}, {"time": 5369, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of opportunities to start to automate these chains."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "And a lot of the inefficiency today is because like you have a delay, like Port of LA has a bunch of ships right now waiting outside of it because they can't dock because there's not enough labor inside of the Port of LA."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "There's a big backlog of trucks, which means there's a big backlog of deliveries, which means the drivers aren't where they need to be."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "And so you have this like huge chain reaction and your feasibility of readjusting in this network is low because everything's tied to humans and manual kind of processes or distributed processes across a whole bunch of players."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "And so one of the biggest enablers is, yes, we have to solve autonomous trucking first."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "And that, by the way, that's not like an overnight thing."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "That's decades of continued kind of expansion and work."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "But the first checkpoint in the first route is like is not that far off."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "But once you start enabling and you start to learn about how the constraints of autonomous trucking, which are very, very different than the constraints of human trucking and again, strengths and weaknesses, how do you then start to leverage that and rethink a flow of goods more broadly?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And this is where like the learnings of like really partnering with some of the largest fleets in the US and the sort of learnings that they have about the industry and the sort of needs that they have."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And what would change if you just like really broke this one constraint that like holds up the whole network?"}, {"time": 5450, "text": "Or what if you enable this other constraint?"}, {"time": 5450, "text": "That actually drives the roadmap in a lot of ways because this is not like an all or nothing problem."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "You start to kind of unlock more and more functionality over time, which functionality most enables this optimization ends up being kind of part of the discussion."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "But you're totally right."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "Like you fast forward to like five years, 10 years, 15 years, and you think about like very generalized capability of automation and logistics, as well as the ability to like poke into how those handoffs work."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "The efficiency goes far beyond just direct cost of today's like unit economics of a truck."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "They go towards reinventing the entire system in the same way that you see these other industries that like when you get to enough scale, you can really rethink how you build around your new set of capabilities, not the old set of capabilities."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "Yeah, use the analogy metaphor or whatever that autonomous trucking is like email versus mail."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "And then with email, you're still doing the communication, but it opens up all kinds of communities, varieties of communication that you didn't anticipate."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "Constraints are just completely different."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "And yeah, there's a definitely a property of that here."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "And we're also still learning about it because there is a lot of really fascinating and sometimes really elegant things that the industry has done where there's companies whose entire existence is around, despite the constraints, optimizing as much as they can out of it."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "And those lessons do carry over."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "But it's an interesting kind of merger of worlds to think about like, well, what if this was completely different?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "How would we approach it?"}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And the interesting thing is that for a really, really, really long time, it's actually going to be the merger between how to use autonomy and how to use humans that leans into each of their strengths."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "And then we're back to Cosmo, human robot interaction."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "So and the interesting thing about Waymo is because there's the passenger vehicle, the human, the transportation of humans and transportation of goods, you could see over time, they may kind of meld together more because you'll probably have like zero occupancy vehicles moving around."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "So you have transportation of goods for short distances and then for slightly longer distances and then slightly longer and then there'll be this, then you just see the difference between a passenger vehicle and a truck is just size and you can have different sizes and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "And at the core, you can have a Waymo driver that doesn't, as long as you have the same sense of suite, you can just think of it as one problem."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "And that's why over time, these do kind of converge where in a lot of ways, a lot of the challenges we're solving are freeway driving, which are going to carry over very well to the vehicles, to the car side."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "But there are like then unique challenges like you have a very different dynamics in your vehicle where you have to see much further out in order to have the proper response time because you have an 80,000 pound fully loaded truck."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "That's a very, very different type of breaking profile than a car."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "You have a really interesting kind of dynamic limits because of the trailer where you actually, it's very, very hard to like physically like flip a car or do something like physically like most risk in a car is from just collisions."}, {"time": 5638, "text": "It's very hard to like in any normal operation to do something other than like unless you hit something to actually kind of like roll over something on a truck, you actually have to drive much closer to the physical bounds of the safety limits."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "But you actually have like real constraints because you could have really interesting interactions between the cabin and the trailer."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "There's something called jackknifing if you turn too quickly, you have roll risk and so forth."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "And so we spent a huge amount of time understanding those boundaries and those boundaries change based on the load that you have, which is also an interesting difference."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "You have to propagate that through the algorithm so that you're leveraging your dynamic range, but always staying within the safety bounds, but understanding what those safety bounds are."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "And so we have this like really cool test facility where we like take it to the max and actually imagine a truck with these giant training wheels on the back of the trailer and you're pushing it past the safety limits in order to like try to actually see where it rolls."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "And so you define this high dimensional boundary, which then gets captured in software to stay safe and actually do the right thing."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "But it's kind of fascinating the sort of kind of challenges you have there."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "But then all of these things drive really interesting challenges from perception to unique behavior prediction challenges."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "And obviously in Planner where you have to think about merging and creating gaps with a 53 foot trailer and so forth."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "And then obviously the platform itself is very different."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "We have different numbers of sensors, sometimes types of sensors, and you also have unique blind spots that you have because of the trailer, which you have to think about."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And so it's a really interesting spectrum."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And in the end, you try to capture these special cases in a way that is cleanly augmentations of the existing tech stack because a majority of what we're solving is actually generalizable to freeway driving and different platforms."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "And over time, they all start to kind of merge ideally where the things that are unique are as minimal as possible."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And that's where you get the most leverage."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And that's why Waymo can take on two trillion dollar opportunities and have been nowhere near 2x the cost or investment or size."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "In fact, it's much, much smaller than that because of the high degree of leverage."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "So what kind of sensor suite they can speak to that a long haul truck needs to have?"}, {"time": 5770, "text": "Lidar, vision, how many?"}, {"time": 5781, "text": "Yeah, so it's more than the car."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "So very loosely you can think of it as like 2x, but it varies depending on the sensor."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "And so we have like dozens of cameras, radar, and then multiple Lidar as well."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "You'll see one difference where the cars have a central main sensor pod on the roof in the middle and then some kind of hood sensors for blind spots."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "The truck moves to two main sensor pods on the outsides where you would typically have the mirrors next to the driver."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "They effectively go as far out as possible, kind of up to the front, kind of on the cabin, not all the way in the front, but like kind of where the mirrors for the driver would be."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "And so those are the main sensor pods."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "And the reason they're there is because if you had one in the middle, the trailer is higher than the cabin and you would be occluded with this like awkward wedge."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Too much occlusion."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And so then you would add a lot of complexity to the software to make up for that and just unnecessary complexity."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "There's so many probably fascinating design choices here."}, {"time": 5838, "text": "Because you can probably bring up a Lidar higher and have it in the center or something."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "You could have all kinds of choices to make the decisions here that ultimately probably will define the industry."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "But by having two on the side, there's actually multiple benefits."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "So one is like you're just beyond the trailer so you can see fully flush with the trailer."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And so you eliminate most of your blind spot except for right behind the trailer, which is great because now the software carries over really well."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "And the same perception system you use on the car side, largely that architecture can carry over and you can retrain some models and so forth that you leverage it a lot."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "It also actually helps with redundancy where there's a really not nice built in redundancy for all the Lidar cameras and radar where you can afford to have any one of them fail and you're still OK. And at scale, every one of them will fail."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "And you will be able to detect when one of them fails because they don't because the redundancy that they're giving you the data that's inconsistent with the rest of that's right."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And it's not just like they no longer give data."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "It could be like they're fouled or they stop giving data where some electrical thing gets cut or part of your compute goes down."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "So what's neat is that like you have way more sensors."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Part of his field of view and occlusions, part of its redundancy and part of it is new use cases."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So there's new types of sensors to optimize for long range and kind of the sensing horizon that we look for on our vehicles that is unique to trucks because it actually is like kind of much like further out than than a car."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "But a majority are actually used across both cars and trucks."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "And so we use the same compute, the same fundamental baseline sensors, cameras, radar, IMUs."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "And so you get a great leverage from all of the infrastructure and the hardware development as a result."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So what about cameras?"}, {"time": 5941, "text": "What role does."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So LIDAR is this rich set of information that has its strengths, has some weaknesses."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Camera is this rich source of information that has some strengths, has its weaknesses."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "What role does LIDAR play?"}, {"time": 5956, "text": "What role does vision cameras play in this beautiful problem of autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "There's like so much that comes together."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And how much and at which point do they come together?"}, {"time": 5971, "text": "So I'll start with LIDAR."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "So LIDAR has been like Waymo's, one of Waymo's big strengths and advantages where we developed our own LIDAR in house where many generations in both in cost and functionality."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "It is the best in this space."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Which generation?"}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Because I know there's this there's this cool."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "I mean, I love versions that are increasing."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "Which version of the hardware stack is it currently, officially, publicly?"}, {"time": 6001, "text": "So some parts iterate more than others."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "I'm trying to remember on the sensor side."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "So the entire self driving system, which includes sensors and compute, is fifth generation."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "I can't wait until there's like iPhone style like announcements for like new versions of the Waymo hardware."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Well, we try to be careful because, man, when you change the hardware, it takes a lot to like retrain the models and everything."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "So we just went through that and going from the Pacificus to the Jaguars."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "And so the Jaguars and then the trucks are, you know, have the same generation now."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "But yeah, the LIDAR is it's incredible."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And so Waymo has leaned into that as a strength."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "And so a lot of the near range perception system that obviously kind of carries over a lot from the car side uses LIDAR as a very prominent kind of like primary sensor."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "But then obviously everything has its strengths and weaknesses."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "And so in the near range, LIDAR is a gigantic advantage and it has its weaknesses on when it comes to occlusions in certain areas, rain and weather, like things like that."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "But it's an incredible sensor and it gives you incredible density, perfect location precision and consistency, which is a very valuable property to be able to kind of apply ML approaches."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "Can you elaborate consistency?"}, {"time": 6075, "text": "When you have a camera, the position of the sun, the time of the day, various of the properties can have a big impact, whether there's glare, the field of view, things like that."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "So consistent in the face of a changing external environment, the signal."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "Daytime, nighttime."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "It's about 3D physical existence, in effect, like you're seeing beams of light that physically bounce off of something and come back."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And so whatever the conditional conditions are, like the shape of a human sensor reading from a human or from a car or from an animal, like you have a reliability there, which ends up being valuable for kind of like the long tail of challenges."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "So LIDAR is the first sensor to drop off in terms of range and ours has a really good range, but at the end of the day, it drops off."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "Now, cameras have the incredible range where you get a high density, high resolution camera, you can get data, you know, well past a kilometer and it's like really potentially a huge value."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Now, the signal drops off, the noise is higher, detecting is harder, classifying is harder and one that you may not think about localizing is harder because you can be off by like two meters and where something's located a kilometer away."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And that's the difference between being on the shoulder and being in your lane."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And so you have like interesting challenges there that you have to solve, which have a bunch of approaches that come into it."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "Radar is interesting because it also has longer range than LIDAR and it gives you speed information."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So it becomes very, very useful for dynamic information of traffic flow, vehicle motions, animals, pedestrians, like just things that might be useful signals."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "And it helps with weather conditions where radar actually penetrates weather conditions in a better way than other sensors."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "And so it's kind of interesting where we've kind of started to converge towards not thinking about a problem as a LIDAR problem or a camera problem or radar problem, but it's a fusion problem where these are all like large scale ML problems where you put data into the system."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "And in many cases, you just look for the signals that might be present in the union of all of these and leave it to the system as much as possible to start to really identify how to how to extract that."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "And then there's places we have to intervene and actually include more."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "But no single sensor is in a great position to really solve this problem and then without a huge extra challenge."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "There's a question that's probably still an open question is at which point do you fuse them?"}, {"time": 6248, "text": "Do you solve the perception problem for each sensor suite individually, the LIDAR suite and the camera suite?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Or do you do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or do you fuse at the very beginning?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Is there a good answer or at least an inkling of intuitions you can come up with?"}, {"time": 6275, "text": "Yeah, so people refer to this as early fusion or late fusion."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "So late fusion might be that you have the camera pipeline, the LIDAR pipeline, and then you fuse them and when it gets to final semantics and classification and tracking, you fuse them together and figure out which one's best."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "There's more and more evidence that early fusion is important, and that is because late fusion does not allow you to pick up on the complementary strengths and weaknesses of the sensors."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "Weather is a great example where if you do early fusion, you have an incredibly hard problem for any single sensor in rain to solve that problem because you have reflections from the LIDAR, you have weird kind of noise from the camera, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "But the combination of all of them can help you filter and help you get to the real signal that then gets you as close as possible to the original stack."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "And be much more fluid about the strengths and weaknesses where your camera is much more susceptible to fouling on the actual lens from rain or random stuff, whereas you might be a little bit more resilient in other sensors."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "So there's an element of logic that always happens late in the game, but that fusion early on, especially as you move towards ML and large scale data driven approaches, just maximizes your ability to pull out the best signal you can out of each modality before you start making constraining decisions that end up being hard to unwind late in the stack."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "So how much of this is a machine learning problem?"}, {"time": 6366, "text": "What role does ML, machine learning, play in this whole problem of autonomous driving, autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 6376, "text": "It's massive, and it's increasing over time."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "If you go back to the grand challenge days and the early days of AV development, there was ML, but it was not in the mass scale data style of ML."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "It was like learning models, but in a more structured kind of way."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "And it was a lot of heuristic and search based approaches and planning and so forth."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "You can make a lot of progress with these types of approaches kind of across the board and almost deceptive amount of progress."}, {"time": 6406, "text": "We can get pretty far, but then you start to really grind the further you get in some parts of the stack if you don't have an ability to absorb a massive amount of experience in a way that scales very sublinearly in terms of human labor and human attention."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And so when you look at the stack, the perception side is probably the first to get really revolutionized by ML, and it goes back many years because ML for computer vision and these types of approaches kind of took off with a lot of the early kind of push in deep learning."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "And so there's always a debate on the spectrum between end to end ML, which is a little bit too far to how you architect it to where you have modules, but enough ability to think about long tail problems and so forth."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And that has been one of the realizations as you drive tens of millions of miles and try to solve new expansions of domains without regressing your old ones, it becomes intractable for a human to approach that in the way that traditionally robotics has kind of approached some elements of the tech stack."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "So are you trying to create a data pipeline specifically for the trucking problem?"}, {"time": 6492, "text": "How much leveraging of the autonomous driving is there in terms of data collection?"}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And how unique is the data required for the trucking problem?"}, {"time": 6510, "text": "So we reuse all the same infrastructure, so labeling workflows, ML workflows, everything, so that actually carries over quite well."}, {"time": 6510, "text": "We heavily reuse the data even, where almost every model that we have on a truck, we started with the latest car model."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "So it's almost like a good back arm model."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "Yeah, it's like you can think of like, despite the different domain and different numbers of sensors and position of sensors, there's a lot of signals that carry over across driving."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "And so it's almost like pre training and getting a big boost out of the gate where you can reduce the amount of data you need by a lot."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And it goes both ways, actually."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And so we're increasingly thinking about our data strategy on how we leverage both of these."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "So you think about, you know, how other agents react to a truck."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Yeah, it's a little bit different, but the fundamentals are actually like, what will other vehicles in the road do?"}, {"time": 6549, "text": "There's a lot of carry over that's possible."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "And in fact, just to give you an example, we're constantly kind of like adding more data from the trucking side."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "But as of right now, when we think of our, like one of our models, behavior prediction for other agents on the road, like vehicles, 85% of that data comes from cars."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And a lot of that 85% comes from surface streets, because we just had so much of it, and it was really valuable."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And so we're adding in more and more, particularly in the areas where we need more data, but you get a huge boost out of the gate."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "Just all different visual characteristics of roads, lane markings, pedestrians, all that that's still relevant."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "It's all still relevant."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "And then just the fundamentals of how, you know, you detect the car."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "Does it really change that much, whether you're detecting it from a car or a truck?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "The fundamentals of how a person will walk around your vehicle is that it'll change a little bit."}, {"time": 6610, "text": "But the basics, like there's a lot of signal in there that as a starting point to a network can actually be very valuable."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "Now, we do have some very unique challenges where there's a sparsity of events on a freeway."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "The frequency of events happening on a freeway, whether it's interesting objects in the road or incidents or even like from a human benchmark, like how often does a human have an accident on a freeway is far more sparse than on a surface street."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "And so that leads to really interesting data problems where you can't just drive infinitely to encounter all the different permutations of things you might encounter."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "And so there you get into interesting tools like structure testing and data collection, data augmentation and so forth."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And so there's really interesting kind of technical challenges that push some of the research that enables these new new suites of approaches."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "What role does simulation play?"}, {"time": 6659, "text": "Really good question."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "So Waymo simulates about a thousand miles for every mile it drives."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So you think of in both."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So across the board, across the board."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So you think of, for example, well, if we've driven over 20 million miles, that's over 20 billion miles in simulation."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Now, how do you use simulation?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "It's a multipurpose."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So you use it for basic development."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "So you want to do make sure you have regression, prevention and protection of everything you're doing."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "When you encounter something interesting in the world, let's say there was an issue with how the vehicle behaved versus an ideal human."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "You can play that back in simulation and start augmenting your system and seeing how you would have reacted to that scenario with this improvement or this new area."}, {"time": 6706, "text": "You can create scenarios that become part of your regression set after that point."}, {"time": 6711, "text": "Then you start getting into like really, really kind of hill climbing where you say, hey, I need to improve this system."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "I have these metrics are really correlated with final performance."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "How do I know how well I'm doing operation?"}, {"time": 6724, "text": "The actual physical driving is the least efficient form of testing and it's expensive."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "It's time consuming."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "So grabbing a large scale batch of historical data and simulating it to get a signal of over these last or just random sample of one hundred thousand miles."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "How has this metric changed versus where we are today?"}, {"time": 6740, "text": "You can do that far more efficiently in simulation than just driving with that new system on board."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "And then you go all the way to the validation phase where to actually see your human relative safety of like how well are you performing on the car side or the trucking side relative to a human."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "A lot of that safety case is actually driven by taking all of the physical operational driving, which probably includes a lot of interventions where the driver took over just in case."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And then you simulate those forward and see if would anything have happened."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And in most cases, the answer is no."}, {"time": 6779, "text": "But you can simulate it forward and you can even start to do really interesting things where you add virtual agents to create harder environments."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "You can fuzz the locations of physical agents."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "You can muck with the scene and stress test the scenario from a whole bunch of different dimensions."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "And effectively, you're trying to like more efficiently sample this like infinite dimensional space, but try to encounter the problems as fast as possible."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Because what most people don't realize is the hardest problem in autonomous driving is actually the evaluation problem in many ways, not the actual autonomy problem."}, {"time": 6811, "text": "And so if you could, in theory, evaluate perfectly and instantaneously, you can solve that problem in a really fast feedback loop quite well."}, {"time": 6819, "text": "But the hardest part is being really smart about this suite of approaches on how can you get an accurate signal on how well you're doing as quickly as possible in a way that correlates to physical driving."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Can you explain the evaluation problem?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Which metric are you evaluating towards?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Are we talking about safety?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "What are the performance metrics that we're talking about?"}, {"time": 6840, "text": "So in the end, you care about end safety."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "That's what's deceptive where there's a lot of companies that have a great demo."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "The path from a really great demo to being able to go driverless can be deceptively long, even when that demo looks like it's driverless quality."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "And the difference is that the thing that keeps you from going driverless is not the stuff you encounter in a demo."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "It's the stuff that you encounter once at 100,000 miles or 500,000 miles."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And so that is at the root of what is most challenging about going driverless because any issue you encounter, you can go and fix it."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "But how do you know you didn't create five other issues that you haven't encountered yet?"}, {"time": 6880, "text": "So those were painful learnings in Waymo's history that Waymo went through and led to us then finally being able to go driverless in Phoenix and now are at the heart of how we develop."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "Evaluation is simultaneously evaluating final kind of end safety of how ready are you to go driverless, which may be as direct as what is your collision, human relative kind of collision rate for all these types of scenarios and and severities to make sure that you're better than a human bar by a good amount."}, {"time": 6917, "text": "But that's not actually the most useful for development."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "For development, it's much more kind of analog metrics that are part of the art of finding how, what are the properties of driving that give you a way quicker signal that's more sensitive than a collision that can correlate to the quality you care about and push the feedback loop to all of your development?"}, {"time": 6940, "text": "A lot of these are, for example, comparisons to human drivers, like manual drivers."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "How do you do relative to a human driver in various dimensions of various circumstances?"}, {"time": 6949, "text": "Can I ask you a tricky question?"}, {"time": 6949, "text": "So if I brought you a truck, how would you test it?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "Okay, Alan Turing came along and you said, This one can't tell if it's a human driver or autonomous driver."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "But not the human because, you know, humans are flawed."}, {"time": 6966, "text": "How do you actually know you're ready, basically?"}, {"time": 6966, "text": "How do you know it's good enough?"}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And by the way, this is the reason why Waymo released the safety framework for the car side, because one, it sets the bar so nobody cuts below it and does something bad for the field that causes an accident."}, {"time": 6982, "text": "And two, it's to start the conversation on framing what does this need to look like?"}, {"time": 6982, "text": "Same thing we'll end up doing for the trucking side."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "It ends up being different portfolio of approaches."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "There's easy things like, are you compliant with all these fundamental rules of the road?"}, {"time": 6999, "text": "Like you never drive above the speed limit."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "That's actually pretty easy."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "You can fundamentally prove that it's either impossible to violate that rule or that you can itemize the scenarios where that comes up and you can do a test and show that you pass that test and therefore you can handle that scenario."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "And so those are like traditional structure testing kind of system engineering approaches where you can just, like fault rates is another example where when something fails, how do you deal with it?"}, {"time": 7029, "text": "You're not going to drive and randomly wait for it to fail."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "You're going to force a failure and make sure that you can handle it and close courses and simulation or on the road and run through all the permutations of failures, which you can oftentimes for some parts of the system itemize like hardware."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "The hardest part is behavioral where you have just infinite situations that could in theory happen and you want to figure out the combinations of approaches that can work there."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "You can probably pass the Turing test pretty quickly, even if you're not like completely ready for driverless because the events that are really kind of like hard will not happen that often."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "Just to give you a perspective, a human has a serious accident on a freeway, like a truck driver on a freeway."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "There's a serious event happens once every 1.3 million miles and something that actually has like really serious injuries, 28 million miles."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And so those are really rare."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And so you could have a driver that looks like it's ready to go, but you have no signal on what happens there."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "And so that's where you start to get creative on combinations of sampling and statistical arguments, focused structured arguments where you can kind of simulate those scenarios and show that you can handle them and metrics that are correlated with what you care about, but you can measure much more quickly and get to a right answer."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "And that's what makes it pretty hard."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "And in the end, you end up borrowing a lot of properties from aerospace and like space shuttles and so forth where you don't get the chance to launch it a million times just to say you're ready because it's too expensive to fail."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "And so you go through a huge amount of kind of structured approaches in order to validate it."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "And then by thoroughness, you can make a strong argument that you're ready to go."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "This is actually a harder problem in a lot of ways, though, because you can think of a space shuttle as getting to a fixed point and then you kind of like or an airplane and you like freeze the software and then you like prove it and you're good to go."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "Here you have to get to a driverless quality bar, but then continue to aggressively change the software even while you're driverless."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "And also the full range of environment that you there's an external environment where the shuttle is you're basically testing the like the systems, the internal stuff."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "And you have a lot of control in the external stuff."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "And the hard part is how do you know you didn't get worse in something that you just changed?"}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And so so in a lot of ways, like the Turing test starts to fail pretty quickly because you start to feel driverless quality pretty early in that curve."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "And if you think about it, right, like in most most kind of, you know, really good A.V."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "demos, maybe you'll sit there for 30 minutes."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "So you've driven, you know, 15 miles or something like that to go driverless."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Like what's the sort of rate of issues that you need to have?"}, {"time": 7197, "text": "You won't even encounter."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "So let's try something different then."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "Let's try a different version of the Turing test, which is like an IQ test."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "So there's these difficult questions of increasing difficulty."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "They're very they're they're designed."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "You don't know them ahead of time."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "Nobody knows the answer to them."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "And so is it possible to in the future orchestrate basically really difficult course almost of like."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "That maybe change every year."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "And that represent if you can pass these, they don't necessarily represent the full spectrum."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "They won't be conclusive, but you can at least get a really quick read and filter."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "Like you're able to."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "Because you didn't know them ahead of time."}, {"time": 7242, "text": "Probably like construction zones, failures or or driving anywhere in Russia."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "Snow, weather, cut ins, dense traffic, kind of merging, lane closures, animal foreign objects on a road that pop out on short notice, mechanical failures, sensor breaking, tire popped, weird behaviors by other vehicles like a heartbreak, something reckless that they've done, fouling of sensors like bugs or birds, you know, poop or something."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So but yeah, like you have these like kind of like extreme conditions where like you have a nasty construction zone where everything shuts down and you have to like, you know, get pulled to the other side of the freeway with a temporary lane like that."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "Those are sort of conditions where we do that to ourselves."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "We itemize everything that could possibly happen to give you a starting point to how to think about what you need to develop."}, {"time": 7293, "text": "And at the end of the day, there's no substitute for real miles."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "Like if you think of traditional ML, like, you know how there's like a validation set where you hold out some data and like real world driving is the ultimate validation set."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "That's the in the end, like the cleanest signal."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But you can do a really good job on creating an obstacle course."}, {"time": 7309, "text": "And you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 7309, "text": "Like at the end, if there was such a thing as automating and kind of a readiness, it would be these extreme conditions like a red light runner."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "A really reckless pedestrian that's jaywalking, a cyclist that, you know, makes like a really awkward maneuver."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "That's actually what keeps you from going driverless."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "Like in the end, that is the long tail."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "And it's interesting to think about that."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "That to me is the Turing test."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Turing test means a lot of things."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "But to me, in driving, the Turing test is exactly this validation set that is handcrafted."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "There's a guy named Francois Chollet."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "He thinks about like how to design a test for general intelligence."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "He designs these IQ tests for machines."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And the validation set for him is handcrafted."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And that it requires like human genius or ingenuity to create a really good test."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "And you hold, you truly hold it out."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "It's an interesting perspective on the validation set, which is like, make that as hard as possible."}, {"time": 7374, "text": "Not a generic representation of the data, but this is the hardest."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "The hardest."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "You know, it's like go."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "Like you'll never fully itemize like all the world states that you'll expand."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And so you have to come up with different approaches."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And this is where you start hitting the struggles of ML, where ML is fantastic at optimizing the average case."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "It's a really unique craft to think about how you deal with the worst case, which is what we care about in the AV space when using an ML system on something that occurs like super infrequently."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "So like you don't care about the worst case really on ads because if you miss a few, it's not a big deal."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "But you do care about it on the driving side."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "And so typically like you'll never fully enumerate the world."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "And so you have to take a step back and abstract away what are the signals that you care about and the properties of a driver that correlate to defensive driving and avoiding nasty situations."}, {"time": 7429, "text": "That even though you'll always be surprised by things you'll encounter, you feel good about your ability to generalize from what you've learned."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "Let me ask you a tricky question."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "So to me, the two companies that are building at scale some of the most incredible robots ever built is Waymo and Tesla."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "So there's very distinct approaches technically, philosophically in these two systems."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "Let me ask you to play sort of devil's advocate and then the devil's advocate to the devil's advocate."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "It's a bit of a race."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "Of course, everyone can win."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "But if Waymo wins this race to level four, why would they win?"}, {"time": 7483, "text": "What aspect of the approach do you think would be the winning aspect?"}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And if Tesla wins, why would they win and which aspect of their approach would be the reason?"}, {"time": 7495, "text": "Just building some intuition, almost not from a business perspective, from any of that, just technically."}, {"time": 7501, "text": "And we could summarize, I think maybe you can correct me, one of the more distinct aspects is Waymo has a richer suite of sensors as LIDAR and vision."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Tesla now removed radar."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "They do vision only."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Tesla has a larger fleet of vehicles operated by humans."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "So it's already deployed on the field and it's a larger, what do you call it, operational domain."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "And then Waymo is more focused on a specific domain and growing it with fewer vehicles."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "So both are fascinating approaches."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "I think there's a lot of brilliant ideas."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Nobody knows the answer."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "So I'd love to get your comments on this lay of the land."}, {"time": 7548, "text": "So maybe I'll start with Waymo."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "And you're right, both incredible companies and just a gigantic respect to everything Tesla has accomplished and how they pushed the field forward as well."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "So on the Waymo side, there is a fundamental advantage in the fact that it is focused and geared towards L4 from the very beginning."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "We've customized the sensor suite for it, the hardware, the compute, the infrastructure, the tech stack and all of the investment inside the company."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "That's deceptively important because there's like a giant spectrum of problems you have to solve in order to really do this from infrastructure to hardware to autonomy stack to the safety framework."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "And that's an advantage because there's a reason why it's the fifth generation hardware and why all of those learnings went into the Dimore program."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "It becomes such an advantage because you learn a lot as you drive and you optimize for the best information you have."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "But fundamentally, like there's a big, big jump, like every order of magnitude that you drive in numbers of miles and what you learn and the gap from really kind of like decent progress for L2 and so forth to what it takes to actually go L4."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And at the end of the day, there's a feeling that Waymo has there's a long way to go."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "Nobody's won, but there's a lot of advantages in all of these buckets where it's the only company that has shipped a fully driverless service where you can go and you can use it and it's at a decently sizable scale."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And those learnings can feed forward to how to solve the more general problems."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "And you see this process you've deployed in Chandler."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "You don't know the timeline exactly, but you could see the steps."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "They seem almost incremental."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "It's become more engineering than totally blind R&D."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "It works in one place and then you move to another place and you grow it this way."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "And so those learnings you just can't shortcut."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "And so that's an advantage."}, {"time": 7691, "text": "And so there's a lot of open challenges to kind of get through, technical, organizational, like how do you solve problems that are increasingly broad and complex like this, work on multiple products."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "But there's the feeling that, okay, like balls in our court, there's a head start there."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "Now we've got to go and solve it."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And I think that focus on L4, it's a fundamentally different problem."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "If you think about it, like let's say we were designing an L2 truck that was meant to be safer and help a human."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "You could do that with far less sensors, far less complexity and provide value very quickly, arguably what we already have today just packaged up in a good product."}, {"time": 7725, "text": "But you would take a huge risk in having a gap from even the like compute and sensors, not to mention the software, to then jump from that system to an L4 system."}, {"time": 7735, "text": "So it's a huge risk basically."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "So again, allow me to be the person that plays the devil's advocate and argue for the Tesla approach."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "So what you just laid out makes perfect sense and is exactly right."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "I have some open questions here, which is it's possible that investing more in faster data collection, which is essentially what Tesla is doing, will get us there faster if the sensor suite doesn't matter as much and machine learning can do a lot of the work."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "My question is, how much is the thing you mentioned before, how much of driving can be end to end learned?"}, {"time": 7779, "text": "Obviously, the Waymo and the vision only machine learning approach will solve driving eventually, both."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "The question is of timeline, what's faster?"}, {"time": 7791, "text": "And what you mentioned, like if I were to make the opposite argument, like what puts Tesla in the strongest position, it's data."}, {"time": 7797, "text": "That is their superpower where they have an access to real world data effectively with a safety driver."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "They found a way to get paid by safety drivers versus safer safety drivers."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "But all joking aside, one, it is incredible that they've built a business that's incredibly successful that can now be a foundation and bootstrap really aggressive investment in the autonomy space."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "If you can do it, that's always like an incredible kind of advantage."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "And in the data aspect of it, it is a giant amount of data if you can use it the right way to then solve the problem."}, {"time": 7834, "text": "But the ability to collect and filter through to the things that matter at real world scale, like a large distribution, that is huge."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "Like it's a big advantage."}, {"time": 7845, "text": "And so then the question becomes, can you use it in the right way?"}, {"time": 7848, "text": "And do you have the right software systems and hardware systems in order to solve the problem?"}, {"time": 7853, "text": "And you're right that in the long term, there's no reason to believe that pure camera systems can't solve the problem that humans obviously are solving with vision systems."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "But it's a risk."}, {"time": 7866, "text": "So there's no argument that it's not a risk."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "And it's already such a hard problem."}, {"time": 7872, "text": "And so much of that problem, by the way, is even beyond the perception side, some of the hardest elements of the problem on the behavioral side and decision making and the long tail safety case."}, {"time": 7882, "text": "If you are adding risk and complexity on the input side from perception, you're now making a really, really hard problem, which on its own is still almost insurmountably hard, even harder."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "And so the question is just how much."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "And this is where you can easily get into a little bit of a kind of a trap where similar to how you how do you evaluate how good an AV company's product is."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "Like you go and you do a trial kind of a test run with them, a demo run, which they've kind of optimized like crazy and so forth and like and it feels good."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "Do you do you put any weight in that?"}, {"time": 7915, "text": "You know that that gap is kind of like, you know, pretty large still."}, {"time": 7919, "text": "Same thing on the like perception case, like the long tail of computer vision is really, really hard."}, {"time": 7924, "text": "And there's a lot of ways that that can come up."}, {"time":

people suffer and that human suffering is really important to think about."}, {"time": 8838, "text": "But trucking is, I mean, there's a lot written on this is I would say far from the thing that will cause the most pain."}, {"time": 8848, "text": "Yeah, there's even more positive properties about trucking where not only is there just a huge shortage which is going to increase, the average age of truck drivers is getting closer to 50 because the younger people aren't wanting to come into it."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "They're trying to like incentivize, lower the age limit, like all these sort of things."}, {"time": 8864, "text": "And the demand is just going to increase."}, {"time": 8866, "text": "And the least favorable, I mean, it depends on the person, but in most cases, the least favorable types of routes are the massive long haul routes where you're on the road away from your family 300 plus days a year."}, {"time": 8876, "text": "Steve talked about the pain of those kinds of routes from a family perspective."}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You're basically away from family."}, {"time": 8883, "text": "It's not just hours, you work insane hours, but it's also just time away from

also where like the biggest kind of safety risk is because of fatigue."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "And so when you think of the gradual evolution of how trucking comes in, first of all, it's not overnight."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "It's going to take decades to kind of phase in all the like, there's just a long, long, long road ahead."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But the routes and the portions of trucking that are going to require humans the longest and benefit the most from humans are the short haul and most complicated kind of more urban routes, which are also the more pleasant ones, which are less continual driving time, more flexibility on like geography and location, and you get to kind of sleep at your own home."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "And very importantly, if you optimize the logistics, you're going to use humans much better and thereby pay them much better."}, {"time": 8945, "text": "Because like one of the biggest problems is truck drivers currently are paid by like how much they drive."}, {"time": 8951, "text": "So they really feel the pain of inefficient logistics because like if they're just sitting around for hours, which they often do not driving, waiting, they're not getting paid for that time."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "So like logistics has a significant impact on the quality of life of a truck driver."}, {"time": 8967, "text": "And a high percentage of trucks are like empty because of inefficiencies in the system."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "Yeah, it's one of those things where like, and the other thing is when you increase the efficiency of a system like this, the overall net like volume of the system tends to increase, right?"}, {"time": 8980, "text": "Like the entire market cap of trucking is going to go up when the efficiency improves and facilitates both growth in industries and better utilization of trucking."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "Yeah, so this is true for trucking, but if we zoom out broader, automation and AI does technology broadly, I would say."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "But you know, automation is a thing that has a potential in the next couple of decades to shift the kind of jobs available to humans."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "And so that results in, like I said, human suffering because people lose their jobs, there's economic pain there, and there's also a pain of meaning."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "So for a lot of people, work is a source of meaning, it's a source of identity, of pride, of pride in getting good at the job, pride in craftsmanship and excellence, which is what truck drivers talk about."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "But this is true for a lot of jobs."}, {"time": 9068, "text": "And is that something you think about as a sort of a roboticist zooming out from the trucking thing?"}, {"time": 9073, "text": "Like where do you think it would be harder to find activity and work that's a source of identity, a source of meaning in the future?"}, {"time": 9084, "text": "I do think about it because you want to make sure that you worry about the entire system, like not just like the part of the economy plays in it, but what are the ripple effects of it down the road."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "And on enough of a time window, there's a lot of opportunity to put in the right policies, the right opportunities to kind of reshape and retrain and find those openings."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "And so just to give you a few examples, both trucking and cars, we have remote assistance facilities that are there to interface with customers and monitor vehicles and provide like very focused kind of assistance on kind of areas where the vehicle may want to request help in understanding an environment."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "So those are jobs that kind of get created and supported."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "I remember like taking a tour of one of the Amazon facilities where you've probably seen the Kiva systems robots where you have these orange robots that have automated the warehouse, like kind of picking and collecting of items."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "And it's like really elegant and beautiful way."}, {"time": 9142, "text": "It's actually one of my favorite applications of robotics of all time."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "You know, like I think it kind of came across a company like 2006 was just amazing."}, {"time": 9150, "text": "And what was the warehouse robots that transport little things?"}, {"time": 9153, "text": "So basically, instead of a person going and walking around and picking the seven items in your order, these robots go and pick up a shelf and move it over in a row where like the seven shelves that contain the seven items are lined up in a laser or whatever points to what you need to get."}, {"time": 9168, "text": "And you go and pick it and you place it to fill the order."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "And so the people are fulfilling the final orders."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "What was interesting about that is that when I was asking them about like kind of the impact on labor when they transitioned that warehouse, the throughput increased so much that the jobs shifted towards the final fulfillment, even though the robots took over entirely the search of the items themselves."}, {"time": 9189, "text": "And the labor, the job stayed like nobody like that was actually the same amount of jobs, roughly they were necessary."}, {"time": 9196, "text": "But the throughput increased by I think over 2x or some amount."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "So you have these situations that are not zero sum games in this really interesting way."}, {"time": 9204, "text": "And the optimist in me thinks that there's these types of solutions in almost any industry where the growth that's enabled creates opportunities that you can then leverage."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "But you got to be intentional about finding those and really helping make those links because even if you make the argument that like there's a net positive, locally there's always tough hits that you got to be very careful about."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "You have to have an understanding of that link because there's a short period of time whether training is acquired or just mental transition or physical or whatever is acquired, that's still going to be short term pain."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "The uncertainty of it, there's families involved."}, {"time": 9240, "text": "It's exceptionally is difficult on a human level and you have to really think about that."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "You can't just look at economic metrics always, it's human beings."}, {"time": 9253, "text": "And you can't even just take it as like, okay, well, we need to like subsidize or whatever because like there is an element of just personal pride where majority of people, like people don't want to just be okay, but like they want to actually like have a craft like you said and have a mission and feel like they're having a really positive impact."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "And so my personal belief is that there's a lot of transferability and skill set that is possible, especially if you create a bridge and an investment to enable it."}, {"time": 9283, "text": "And to some degree, that's our responsibility as well in this process."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "You mentioned Kiva robots, Amazon."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "Let me ask you about the Astro robot, which is, I don't know if you've seen it, it's Amazon has announced that it's a home robot that they have a screen looks awfully a lot like Cosmo has I think different vision probably."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "What are your thoughts about like home robotics in this kind of space?"}, {"time": 9313, "text": "There's been quite a bunch of home robots, social robots that very unfortunately have closed their doors that for various reasons, perhaps it were too expensive, there's manufacturing challenges, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9327, "text": "What are your thoughts about Amazon getting into this space?"}, {"time": 9330, "text": "Yeah, we had some signs that they're getting into it like long, long, long ago."}, {"time": 9334, "text": "Maybe they were a little bit too interested in Cosmo during our conversations, but they're also very good partners actually for us as we kind of just integrated a lot of shared technology."}, {"time": 9344, "text": "If I could also get your thoughts on, you could think of Alexa as a robot as well, Echo."}, {"time": 9353, "text": "Do you see those as fundamentally different just because you can move and look around?"}, {"time": 9358, "text": "Is that fundamentally different than the thing that just sits in place?"}, {"time": 9361, "text": "It opens up options, but my first reaction is I have my doubts that this one's going to hit the mark because I think for the price point that it's at and the kind of functionality and value propositions that they're trying to put out, it's still searching for the killer application that justifies I think it was like a $1,500 price point or kind of somewhere on there."}, {"time": 9430, "text": "I think that's in the end one of the biggest challenges for robotics, especially consumer robotics where you have to kind of meet that bar."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "It becomes very, very hard."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "And there's also the higher bar, just like you were saying with Cosmo, of a thing that can look one way and then turn around and look at you."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "That's either a super desirable quality or a super undesirable quality depending on how much you trust the thing."}, {"time": 9458, "text": "And so there's a problem of trust to solve there."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "There's a problem of personality."}, {"time": 9463, "text": "It's the quote unquote problem that Cosmo solved so well is that you trust the thing, and that has to do with the company, with the leadership, with the intent that's communicated by the device and the company and everything together."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "Yeah, exactly right."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "And I think they also have to retrace some of the learnings on the character side where, as usual, I think that's the place where a lot of companies are great at the hardware side of it and think about those elements."}, {"time": 9490, "text":

10023, "text": "Is it big?"}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Is it little, right?"}, {"time": 10027, "text": "So you would customize it and make it customizable for the different needs if that was the

changes over time, but there's ways to make really approachable and natural interfaces for robotic kind of characters and, you know, kind of deployments in these applications that do not at all look

I'm still confused by the magic I see in legged robots."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "Yeah, so there is a magic."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "So I'm absolutely amazed at it from a technical curiosity standpoint and like the magic that like the Boston Dynamics team can do from, you know, like from walking and jumping and so forth."}, {"time": 10104, "text": "Now, like there's been a long journey to try to find an application for that sort of technology."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "But wow, that's incredible technology, right?"}, {"time": 10112, "text": "So then you kind of go towards, OK, are you working back from a goal of what you're trying to solve?"}, {"time": 10117, "text": "Are you working forward from a technology and I'm looking for a solution?"}, {"time": 10119, "text": "And I think that's where it's a kind of a bi directional search oftentimes, but you got the two have to meet."}, {"time": 10125, "text": "And that's where humanoid robots is kind of close to that."}, {"time": 10129, "text": "And that like it is a decision about a form factor and a technology that it forces that doesn't have a clear justification on why that's the killer app for, you know, from the other end."}, {"time": 10140, "text": "But I think the core fascinating idea with the Tesla bot is the one that's carried by Waymo as well, is when you're solving the general robotics problem of perception control where there's the very clear applications of driving."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "It's as you get better and better at it when you have like Waymo driver."}, {"time": 10159, "text":

goods."}, {"time": 10180, "text": "There's no reason transformer like this thing couldn't, you know, take the goods up an elevator, you know, like that, like slowly expand what it means to move goods and expand more and more of the world into a robotics problem."}, {"time": 10199, "text": "And you start to like think of it as an end end robotics problem from like loading from, you know, from everything else."}, {"time": 10205, "text": "And even like the truck itself, you know, today's generation is integrating into today's understanding of what a vehicle is, right?"}, {"time": 10213, "text": "The Pacifica Jaguar, the Freightliners from Daimler."}, {"time": 10217, "text": "There's nothing that stops these us from like down the road after like starting to get to scale to like expand these partnerships to really rethink what would the next generation of a truck look like that is actually optimized for autonomy, not for today's world."}, {"time": 10234, "text": "And maybe that means a very different type of trailer."}, {"time": 10237, "text": "Maybe that like there's a lot of things you could rethink on that front, which is on its own very, very exciting."}, {"time": 10242, "text": "Let me ask you, like I said, you went to the Mecca of robotics, which is CMU, Carnegie Mellon University."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "You got a PhD there."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "So maybe by way of advice and maybe by way of story and memories, what does it take to get a PhD in robotics at CMU?"}, {"time": 10263, "text": "And maybe you can throw in there some advice for people who are thinking about doing work in artificial intelligence and robotics and are thinking about whether to get a PhD."}, {"time": 10275, "text": "I actually went, I was at CMU for undergrad as well and didn't know anything about robotics coming in and was doing electrical computer engineering, computer science, and really got more and more into kind of AI and then fell in love with autonomous driving."}, {"time": 10288, "text": "And at that point, that was just by a big margin, such an incredible central spot of investment in that area."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "And so what I would say is that robotics, for all the progress that's happened, is still a really young field."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "There's a huge amount of opportunity."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "Now that opportunity shifted where something like autonomous driving has moved from being very research and academics driven to being commercial driven where you see the investments happening in commercial."}, {"time": 10313, "text": "Now there's other areas that are much younger and you see like kind of grasping and manipulation, making kind of the same sort of journey that like autonomy made and there's other areas as well."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "What I would say is the space moves very quickly."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "Anything you do a PhD in, like it is in most areas, will evolve and change as technology changes and constraints change and hardware changes and the world changes."}, {"time": 10335, "text": "And so the beautiful thing about robotics is it's super broad."}, {"time": 10335, "text": "It's not a narrow space at all and it could be a million different things in a million different industries."}, {"time": 10344, "text": "And so it's a great opportunity to come in and get a broad foundation on AI, machine learning, computer vision, systems, hardware, sensors, all these separate things."}, {"time": 10354, "text": "You do need to go deep and find something that you're really, really passionate about."}, {"time": 10354, "text": "Obviously, just like any PhD, this is like a five, six year kind of endeavor."}, {"time": 10366, "text": "And you have to love it enough to go super deep to learn all the things necessary to be super deeply functioning in that area and then contribute to it in a way that hasn't been done before."}, {"time": 10377, "text": "And in robotics, that probably means more breadth because robotics is rarely kind of like one particular kind of narrow technology."}, {"time": 10385, "text": "And it means being able to collaborate with teams where like one of the coolest aspects of like the experience that I kind of cherish in our PhD is that we actually had a pretty large AV project that for that time was like a pretty serious initiative where you got to like partner with a larger team."}, {"time": 10403, "text": "And you had the experts in perception and the experts in planning and the staff and the mechanical engineers."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "So I was working on a project called UPI back then, which was basically the off road version of the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 10415, "text": "It was a DARPA funded project for basically like a large off road vehicle that you would like drop and then give it a waypoint 10 kilometers away and it would have to navigate a completely unstructured environment."}, {"time": 10424, "text": "In an off road environment."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "So like forests, ditches, rocks, vegetation, and so it was like a really, really interesting kind of a hard problem where like wheels would be off to my shoulders."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "It's like gigantic, right?"}, {"time": 10434, "text": "By the way, AV for people stands for autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 10436, "text": "Autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 10439, "text": "And so what I think is like the beauty of robotics, but also kind of like the expectation is that there's spaces in computer science where you can be very, very narrow and deep."}, {"time": 10449, "text": "Robotics, the necessity, but also the beauty of it is that it forces you to be excited about that breadth and that partnership across different disciplines that enable it."}, {"time": 10458, "text": "But that also opens up so many more doors where you can go and you can do robotics and almost any category where robotics isn't really an industry."}, {"time": 10467, "text": "It's like AI, right?"}, {"time": 10469, "text": "It's like the application of physical automation to all these other worlds."}, {"time": 10469, "text": "And so you can do robotic surgery, you can do vehicles, you can do factory automation, you can do health care, you can do like leverage the AI around the sensing to think about static sensors and scene understanding."}, {"time": 10487, "text": "So I think that's got to be the expectation and the excitement and it breeds people that are probably a little bit more collaborative and more excited about working in teams."}, {"time": 10498, "text": "If I could briefly comment on the fact that the robotics people I've met in my life from CMU and MIT, they're really happy people."}, {"time": 10510, "text": "Because I think it's the collaborative thing."}, {"time": 10513, "text": "I think I think you don't."}, {"time": 10516, "text": "You're not like sitting in like the fourth basement."}, {"time": 10519, "text": "Which when you're doing machine learning purely software, it's very tempting to just disappear into your own hole and never collaborate."}, {"time": 10529, "text": "And that breeds a little bit more of the silo mentality of like, I have a problem."}, {"time": 10536, "text": "It's almost like negative to talk to somebody else or something like that."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "But robotics folks are just very collaborative, very friendly."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "And there's also an energy of like you get to confront the physics of reality often, which is humbling and also exciting."}, {"time": 10553, "text": "So it's humbling when it fails and exciting when it finally works."}, {"time": 10557, "text": "It's like a purity of the passion."}, {"time": 10558, "text": "And you've got to remember that like right now, like robotics and AI is like just all the rage and autonomous vehicles and all this, like 15 years ago and 20 years ago, like it wasn't that deeply lucrative."}, {"time": 10571, "text": "People that went into robotics, they did it because they were like thought it was just the coolest thing in the world to like make physical things intelligent in the real world."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "And so there's like a raw passion where they went into it for the right reasons and so forth."}, {"time": 10582, "text": "And so it's really great space."}, {"time": 10582, "text": "And that organizational challenge, by the way, like when you think about the challenges in AV, we talk a lot about the technical challenges."}, {"time": 10590, "text": "The organizational challenges through the roof where you think about what it takes to build an AV system and you have companies that are now thousands of people."}, {"time": 10602, "text": "And you look at other really hard technical problems like an operating system."}, {"time": 10607, "text": "It's pretty well established."}, {"time": 10608, "text": "Like you kind of know that there's a file system, there's virtual memory, there's this, there's that, there's like caching and like and there's like a really reasonably well established modularity and APIs and so forth."}, {"time": 10620, "text": "And so you can kind of like scale it in an efficient fashion."}, {"time": 10623, "text": "That doesn't exist anywhere near to that level of maturity in autonomous driving right now."}, {"time": 10628, "text": "And tech stacks are being reinvented, organizational structures are being reinvented."}, {"time": 10632, "text": "You have problems like pedestrians that are not isolated problems."}, {"time": 10632, "text": "They're part sensing, part behavior prediction, part planning, part evaluation."}, {"time": 10640, "text": "And like one of the biggest challenges is actually how do you solve these problems where the mental capacity of a human is starting to get strained on how do you organize it and think about it where you have this like multidimensional matrix that needs to all work together."}, {"time": 10656, "text": "And so that makes it kind of cool as well because it's not like solved at all from like what does it take to actually scale this, right?"}, {"time": 10665, "text": "And then you look at like other gigantic challenges that have been successful and are way more mature, there's a stability to it."}, {"time": 10673, "text": "And like maybe the autonomous vehicle space will get there."}, {"time": 10676, "text": "But right now, just as many technical challenges as they are, they're like organizational

second, I thought perhaps mapping like a continuous space to a discrete space, like functions over a continuous space, because yeah."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Well, I mean, you can take, if somebody gives you a space, you can ask, you can say, well, let's, and this is also, this is part of the same idea."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "The part of the same idea is that if you try and do geometry and somebody tells you, here's a space, that what you should do is you should wait, so say, wait a minute, maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And so if I do that, the way to start is, you give me the space, I start to think about the functions of the space, okay?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "So for each point in the space, I associate a number."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "I can take different kinds of functions and different kinds of values, but basically functions on a space."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "So what this insight is telling you is that if

side of the algebra start to require you to think about the other side, about geometry in a new way."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea about geometry, or if

beautiful for different reasons."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty, I think really is just kind of an idea is beautiful if it's packages a huge amount of kind of power and information into something very simple."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "What non trivial things does it tell you versus how simply can you express the idea?"}, {"time": 1567, "text": "So the level of compression, what is it correlates with beauty?"}, {"time": 1572, "text": "Yeah, that's one aspect of it."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And so you can start to tell that an idea is becoming uglier and uglier as you start kind of having to, it doesn't quite do what you want."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So you throw in something else to the idea and you keep doing that until you get what you want."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "But that's how you know you're doing something uglier and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding and more into what was originally a fairly simple idea and making it more and more complicated to get what you

biased and we just kind of convince ourselves that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Or is there something about our actual universe that at the core is simple?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "My own belief is that there is something about a universe that's simple and as I was trying to say that, there is some kind of fundamental thing about math, physics and all this picture, which is in some sense simple."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "It's true that, it's of course true that our minds have certain, are very limited and can certainly do certain things and not others."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "So it's in principle possible that there's some great insight in, there are a lot of insights into the way the world works, which just aren't accessible to us because that's not the way our minds work, we don't."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And that what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity is just because that's all we ever have any hope of seeing."},

you disagree with her agreement?"}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And agree with the agreement and so on."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Anyway, yes, I found it was really fascinating reading her book and anyway, I was finding disagreeing with a lot, but then at the end when she says yes, when we find, when we actually figure this out, it will be simple and okay, so we agree in the end."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "But does beauty lead us astray, which is the core thesis of her work in that book."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "I don't think, and especially, and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her about sometimes the way she'll refer to math."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And so the problem is, physicists and people in general just refer to it as math and they're often meaning not what I would call math, which is the interesting ideas of math, but just some complicated calculation."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very, the problem with talking about simplicity and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very, it's very easy to fool yourself and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great and you fall in love with it."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And it's like any kind of love affair, it's very easy to believe that the object of your affections is much more beautiful than the others might think and that they really are."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "And that's very, very easy to do."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So if you say, I'm just gonna pursue ideas about beauty and this and mathematics and this, it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "I see, so it's not that the simplicity of beauty leads us astray, it's just people are people and they fall in love with whatever idea they have and then they weave narratives around that idea or they present it in such a way that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "Yeah, that's part of it."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "I think her emphasis is more, that I don't really disagree with, is that people should be concentrating on when they're trying to develop better theories on more on self consistency, not so much on beauty, but not is this idea beautiful, but is there something about the theory which is not quite consistent and use that as a guide that there's something wrong there which needs fixing."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "And so I think that part of her argument, I think we're on the same page about."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "What is consistency and inconsistencies?"}, {"time": 1968, "text": "What exactly, do you have examples in mind?"}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Well, it can be just simple inconsistency between theory and an experiment that if you, so we have this great fundamental theory, but there are some things that we see out there which don't seem to fit in it, like dark energy and dark matter, for instance."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "But if there's something which you can't test experimentally, I think she would argue and I would agree that, for instance, if you're trying to think about gravity and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, you should kind of test any of your ideas with kind of a thought experiment."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "Does this actually give a consistent picture of what's gonna happen, of what happens in this particular situation or not?"}, {"time": 2013, "text": "You've written about this."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Since quantum gravitational effects are really small, super small, arguably unobservably small, should we have

interested in that effort because basically, yes, you cannot have ways to scientifically validate it given the tools of today."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Yeah, I've actually, you know, I've over the years certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn't been that much in the past the focus of what I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "But I mean, my feeling was always, you know, as I think Sabina would agree that the, you know, one way you can pursue this if you can't do experiments is just this kind of search for consistency."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "You know, it can be remarkably hard to come up with a completely consistent model of this in a way that brings together quantum mechanics and general relativity."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way that people who have pursued quantum gravity have often pursued, you know, we have the best route to finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity and string theorists will tell you this, other people will tell you it, it's kind of what people argue about."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "But the problem with all of that is that you end up, you know, the danger is that you end up with, that everybody could be successful."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Everybody's program for how to find a theory of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something that is consistent."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "And so, and in some sense you could argue this is what happened to the string theorists."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "They solved their problem of finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity and they ended up, but they found 10 to the 500 solutions."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So you, you know, if you believe that everything that they would like to be true is true, well, okay, you've got a theory, but it ends up being kind of useless because it's just one of an infinite, essentially infinite number of things which you have no way to experimentally distinguish."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "And so this is just a depressing situation."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "But I do think that there is a, so again, I think pursuing ideas about what, more about beauty and how can you integrate and unify these issues about gravity with other things we know about physics."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "And can you find a theory where these fit together in a way that makes sense and hopefully predict something."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "That's much more promising."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "Well, it makes sense and hopefully, I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things which is like, it's nice to have a theory that's consistent, but then if the theory is consistent, it doesn't necessarily mean anything."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "It's not enough, it's not enough."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "It's not enough and that's the problem."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "So it's like, it keeps coming back to, okay, there should be some experimental validation."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "So, okay, let's talk a little bit about strength theory."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of strength theory."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Maybe one question first to ask is what is strength theory?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And beyond that, why is it wrong?"}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Or rather as the title of your blog says, not even wrong."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Well, one interesting thing about the current state of strength theory is that, I think it, I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult to at this point to say what strength theory means."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "If people say they're a strength theorist, what they mean and what they're doing is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "But the initial meaning I think goes back to, there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984 in which people felt that they had found a unified theory of our so called standard model of all the standard, well known kind of particle interactions and gravity and it all fit together in a quantum theory."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "And that you could do this in a very specific way by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory of particles moving around in space time, think about a quantum theory of kind of one dimensional loops moving around in space time, so called strings."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And so instead of one degree of freedom, these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "It's a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine, okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of loops moving around in space time."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And what they found is that you could do this and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly make sense of such a quantum theory, but only if space and time together were 10 dimensional."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And so then you had this problem, again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of, okay, now once you make that move, you gotta get rid of six dimensions."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And so the hope was that you could get rid of the six dimensions by making them very small and that consistency of the theory would require that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition called being a Calabi out manifold."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And that we knew very, very few examples of this."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85 was the hope that you could just take this 10 dimensional string theory and find one of a limited number of possible ways of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small and then you would end up with an effective four dimensional theory, which looked like the real world."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "This was the hope."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "So then there's then a very long story about what happened to that hope over the years."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "But it was kind of in the realm of ideas which initially looked good, but the more you look at them, they just, they don't work out the way you want and they don't actually end up carrying the power or that you originally had this vision of."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And yes, the book title is not even wrong."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "What are the different flavors of ideas that came, like that branched out?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "You mentioned 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "You mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "What other interesting ideas to you that kind of emerged from this world?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, the problem with talking about the whole subject and part of the reason I wrote the book is that it gets very, very complicated."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "I mean, there's a huge amount, a lot of people got very interested in this, a lot of people worked on it."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And in some sense, I think what happened is exactly because the idea didn't really work that this caused people to, instead of focusing on this one idea and digging in and working on that, they just kind of kept trying new things."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "And so people, I think, ended up wandering around in a very, very rich space of ideas about mathematics and physics and discovering all sorts of really interesting things."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "It's just the problem is there tended to be an inverse relationship between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful this new idea that they were trying to pursue was and how much it looked like the real world."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "I think one of the most spectacular is what the physicists call two dimensional conformal field theory."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "And so these are basically quantum field theories and kind of think of it as one space and one time dimension, which have just this huge amount of symmetry and a huge amount of structure, which there's some totally fantastic mathematics behind it."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And again, and some of that mathematics is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics around the Langlands program has been around these two dimensional conformal field theories."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "Is there something you could say about what are the major problems are with string theory?"}, {"time": 2538, "text": "So like, besides that there's no experimental validation, you've written that a big hole in string theory has been its perturbative definition."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "Perhaps that's one, can you explain what that means?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Well, maybe to begin with, I think the simplest thing to say is, the initial idea really was that, okay, we have this, instead of what's great is we have this thing that only works, it's very structured and has to work in a certain way for it to make sense."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "But then you ended up in 10 space time dimensions."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And so to get back to physics, you had to get rid of five of the dimensions, six of the dimensions."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "And the bottom line I would say in some sense is very simple that what people just discovered is just, there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this, there's an infinite number of ways of doing it and you can get whatever you want depending on how you do it."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So you end up the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions and getting to four just kind of collapses out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want because you can get anything."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "The hope around that problem has always been that the standard formulation that we have of string theory, which is, you can go by the name perturbative, but it's kind of, there's a standard way we know of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory and working with it, which is the so called perturbation theory that we know how to do."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "And that by itself just doesn't give you any hint as to what to do about the six dimensions."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "So actual perturbed string theory by itself really only works in 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions about how I'm gonna go beyond this formulation that we really understand of string theory and get rid of these six dimensions."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So kind of the simplest one was the Klabiau postulate, but when that didn't really work out, people have tried more and more different things."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "And the hope has always been that the solution, this problem would be that you would find a deeper and better understanding of what string theory is that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion and which would generalize this."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "And that once you had that, it would solve this problem of, it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "So if I could restate the problem, it seems like there's a very consistent physical world operating in four dimensions."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "And how do you map a consistent physical world in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world in four dimensions?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And how difficult is this problem?"}, {"time": 2723, "text": "Is that something you can even answer?"}, {"time": 2727, "text": "Just in terms of physics intuition, in terms of mathematics, mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid of the six of the dimensions."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "So there's kind of two ways of doing it."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "One is what we called compactification."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "You say that there really are 10 dimensions, but for whatever reason, six of them are so, so small, we can't see them."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "So you basically start out with 10 dimensions and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity, but just kind of a finite extent and then make that size go down so small, it's unobservable."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "But that's like, that's a math trick."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "So can you also help me build an intuition about how rich and interesting the world in those six dimensions is?"}, {"time": 2777, "text": "So compactification seems to imply... Well, it's not very interesting."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn if you start doing mathematics and looking at geometry and topology and more and more dimensions is that, I mean, asking the question like, what are all possible six dimensional spaces?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "It's just, it's kind of an unnatural question."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "It's just, I mean, it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "There are too many things you can do with all these, if you start trying to make, if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces, it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle, you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But as you go to higher and higher dimensions, there are just so many ways you can put things together of and get something of that dimensionality."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "And so unless you have some very, very strong principle, we're just gonna pick out some very specific ones of these six dimensional spaces."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And there are just too many of them and you can get anything you want."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "So if you have 10 dimensions, the kind of things that happen, say that's actually the way, that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "There's a limited set of behaviors of objects."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I don't know even know what the right terminology to use that can occur within those dimensions, like in reality."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "And so like what I'm getting at is like, is there some consistent constraints?"}, {"time": 2867, "text": "So if you have some constraints that map to reality, then you can start saying like, dimension number seven is kind of boring."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions, one, two, three."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And time is also kind of boring."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And like some are more exciting than others, or we can use our metric of beauty."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Some dimensions are more beautiful than others."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Once you have an actual understanding of what actually happens in those dimensions in our physical world, as opposed to sort of all the possible things that could happen."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "In some sense, I mean, just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "We don't see them."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "So you need to somehow explain them."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "The main thing you're trying to do is to explain why we're not seeing them."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "And so you have to come up with some theory of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And string theory gives you some ideas about how to do that."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "But the bottom line is where you're trying to go with this whole theory you're creating is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So it's not a really, it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing that you're trying to do there."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Why are you just adding in all this stuff and then trying to explain why we don't see it?"}, {"time": 2943, "text": "This may be a dumb question, but is this an obvious thing to state that those six dimensions are unobservable or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Or do you leave a little door open to saying the current tools of physics, and obviously our brains aren't unable to observe them, but we may need to come up with methodologies for observing them."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory into four dimensions, leaving the door open a little bit too, maybe we need to come up with tools that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask, assume that we've got model, look at models with more dimensions and ask, what would the observable effects, how would we know this?"}, {"time": 2994, "text": "And you go out and do experiments."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "So for instance, you have a, like gravitationally you have an inverse square law of forces."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "If you had more dimensions, that inverse square law would change to something else."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law and say, okay, inverse square law is working, but maybe if I get, and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard to measure gravitational effects and even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances because they're so small."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "So you can start looking at the inverse square law and say, start trying to measure it at shorter and shorter distances and see if there were extra dimensions at those distance scales, you would start to see the inverse square law fail."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "And so people look for that and again, you don't see it, but you can, I mean, there's all sorts of experiments of this kind you can imagine which test for effects of extra dimensions at different distance scales, but none of them, I mean, they all just don't work."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Nothing yet."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Nothing yet, but you could say, ah, but it's just much, much smaller, you can say that."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "Which by the way makes LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves quite an incredible project."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Ed Witten is often brought up as one of the most brilliant mathematicians and physicists

strange thing about him in some sense is that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So there's a very large number of people who are nowhere near as smart as he is and don't work anywhere near as hard who have Nobel Prizes."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "I think he just had the misfortune of coming into the field at a time when things had gotten much, much, much tougher and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were, it was very hard to come up with a new idea that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "But he got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did in mathematics, and that's just completely unheard of."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "For mathematicians to give a Fields Medal to someone outside their field in physics is really,

of parameters and a few integers which tell you what the theory is."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "To make this work as a theory of the real world, you need a Higgs field and you need to, it needs to do something."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "And once you introduce that Higgs field, all sorts of parameters make an appearance."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "So now we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are and what's gonna happen."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing with a couple of parameters to this thing, which the minute you put it in, you had to add all this extra, all these extra parameters to make things work."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And so that, it may be one argument as well, that's just the way the world is, and the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse and those numbers are just different in every universe."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "But another reasonable conjecture is just that, well, this is just telling us that there's something we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper way, which would explain those numbers."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And there's some kind of deeper idea about where the Higgs field comes from and what's going on, which we haven't figured out yet."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "And that's what we should look for."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But to stick on string theory a little bit longer, could you play devil's advocate and try to argue for string theory, why it is something that deserved the effort that it got, and still, like if you think of it as a flame, still should be a little flame that keeps burning?"}, {"time": 3434, "text": "Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument for it is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics and about parts of physics really emerge from it."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "That was very a fruitful source of ideas."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And I think this is actually one argument you'll definitely, which I kind of agree with, I'll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists, say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea and it's led to so many other different things coming out of it that there must be something right about this."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And that's, okay, anyway, I think that's probably the strongest thing that they've got."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "But you don't think there's aspects to it that could be neighboring to a theory that does unify everything, to a theory of everything."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Like it could, it may not be exactly, exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer might get us closer to the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "Well, the problem with it now really is that you really don't know what it is now."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up with this nonperturbative theory."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "So it's become more and more frustrating and an odd activity to try to argue with a string theorist about string theory because it's become less and less well defined what it is."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And it's become actually more and more kind of a, whether you have this weird phenomenon of people calling themselves string theorists when they've never actually worked on any theory where there are any strings anywhere."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So what has actually happened kind of sociologically is that you started out with this fairly well defined proposal."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And then I would argue because that didn't work, people branched out in all sorts of directions doing all sorts of things."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "It became farther and farther removed from that."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "And for sociological reasons, the ones who kind of started out or now or were trained by the people who worked on that have now become this string theorists."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "And, but it's becoming almost more kind of a tribal denominator than a, I think so it's very hard to know what you're arguing about when you're arguing about string theory these days."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Well, to push back on that a little bit, I mean, string theory is just a term, right?"}, {"time": 3574, "text": "It doesn't, like you could, like this is the way language evolves is it could start to represent something more than just the theory that involves strings."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?"}, {"time": 3594, "text": "Or something like that."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "So for example, neural networks in the space of machine learning, there was a time when they were extremely popular."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "They became much, much less popular to a point where if you mentioned neural networks, you're getting no funding and you're not going to be respected at conferences."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "And then once again, neural networks became all the rage about 10, 15 years ago."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "And as it goes up and down and a lot of people would argue that using terminology like machine learning and deep learning is often misused over general, everything that works is deep learning, everything that doesn't, isn't something like that."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "That's just the way, again, we're back to sociological things, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is if we leave the sociological mess aside, do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?"}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas from the Ed Wittons of the world, is there some core truths there that we should stick by in the full beautiful mess of a space that we call string theory, that people call string theory?"}, {"time": 3671, "text": "You're right, it is kind of a common problem that how what you call some field changes and evolves and in interesting ways as the field changes."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "But I mean, I guess what I would argue is the initial understanding of string theory that was quite specific, we're talking about a specific idea, 10 dimensional super strings compactified to six dimensions."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "That to my mind, the really bad thing has happened to the subject is that it's hard to get people to admit, at least publicly, that that was a failure, that this really didn't work."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that and they start doing more interesting things, but they keep talking to the public about string theory and referring back to that idea and using that as kind of the starting point and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts and everything else comes from."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So you're continually pointing back to this idea which never worked out as your guiding inspiration."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And it really kind of deforms your whole way of your hopes of making progress."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing that's happened in this field."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "Okay, sure, so there's a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity about communicating the things that failed in the past."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so you don't have a clear picture of like firm ground that you're standing on."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "But again, those are sociological things."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "And there's a bunch of questions I want to ask you."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "So one, what's your intuition about why the original idea failed?"}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So what can you say about why you're pretty sure it has failed?"}, {"time": 3812, "text": "I mean, the initial idea was, as I try to explain it, it was quite seductive in that you could see why Whitten and others got excited by it."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "It was, you know, at the time it looked like there were only a few of these possible clobby owls that would work."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand this very specific model and these very specific six dimensional spaces, and we're going to get everything."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just, you know, as people learned, worked more and more about it, it just didn't, they just kind of realized that there are just more and more things you can do with these six dimensions and you can't, and this is just not going to work."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Meaning like, it's, I mean, what was the failure mode here?"}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Is it, you could just have an infinite number of possibilities that you could do so you can come up with any theory you want, you can fit quantum mechanics, you can explain gravity, you can explain anything you want with it."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "Is that the basic failure mode?"}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea ended up being kind of being essentially empty, that it just doesn't, ends up not telling you anything because it's consistent with just about anything."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "And so, I mean, there's a complex, if you try and talk with string theorists about this now, I mean, there's an argument, there's a long argument over this about whether, oh no, no, no, maybe there still are constraints coming out of this idea or not."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "Or maybe we live in a multiverse and everything is true anyway, so you can, there are various ways you can kind of, that string theorists have kind of react to this kind of argument that I'm making, but I try to hold onto it."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "What about experimental validation?"}, {"time": 3918, "text": "Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory of everything that's trying to unify quantum mechanics and gravity?"}, {"time": 3928, "text": "Yeah, I mean, ultimately, to be really convinced that some new idea about unification really works, you need some kind of, you need to look at the real world and see that this is telling you something true about it."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "I mean, either telling you that if you do some experiment and go out and do it, you'll get some unexpected result and that's the kind of gold standard, or it may be just that like all those numbers that are, we don't know how to explain, it will show you how to calculate them."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation, but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "How tough is this, do you think, for a theory of everything, not just string theory, for something that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics, so the very big and the very small?"}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Is this, let me ask you one way, is it a physics problem, a math problem, or an engineering problem?"}, {"time": 3987, "text": "My guess is it's a combination of a physics and a math problem that you really need."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "It's not really engineering, it's not like there's some kind of well defined thing you can write down and we just don't have enough computer power to do the calculation."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "That's not the kind of problem it is at all."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "But the question is, what mathematical tools you need to properly formulate the problem is unclear."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "So one reasonable conjecture is the way, the reason that we haven't had any success yet is just that we're missing, either we're missing certain physical ideas or we're missing certain mathematical tools, which there are some combination of them, which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem and see that it has a solution that looks like the real world."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "But those you need, I guess you don't, but there's a sense that you need both gravity, like all the laws of physics to be operating on the same level."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So it feels like you need an object like a black hole or something like that in order to make predictions about."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Otherwise, you're always making predictions about this joint phenomena or can you do that as long as the theory is consistent and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?"}, {"time": 4068, "text": "Well, your theory should, I mean, if your theory is gonna include gravity, our current understanding of gravity is that you should have, there should be black hole states in it."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "You should be able to describe black holes in this theory."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And just one aspect that people have concentrated a lot on is just this kind of questions about if your theory includes black holes like it's supposed to and it includes quantum mechanics, then there's certain kinds of paradoxes which come up."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And so that's been a huge focus of kind of quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "So stepping outside of string theory, can you just say first at a high level, what is the theory of everything?"}, {"time": 4108, "text": "What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?"}, {"time": 4112, "text": "Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist point of view in the sense that, so it's not a theory."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "This is not gonna explain to you anything."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "It doesn't really, this kind of theory, this kind of theory of everything we're talking about doesn't say anything interesting, particularly about like macroscopic objects, about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow, or things are happening at this scale."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "But just what we've discovered is that as you look at the universe that kind of, if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart into, and you end up with some fairly simple pieces, quanta, if you like, and which are doing, which are interacting in some fairly simple way."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "And it's, so what we mean by theory of everything is a theory that describes all the object, all the correct objects you need to describe what's happening in the world and describes how they're interacting with each other at our most fundamental level."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "How you get from that theory to describing some macroscopic, incredibly complicated thing is, there that becomes, again, more of an engineering problem and you may need machine learning, or you may, you know, a lot of very different things to do it, but."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "Well, I don't even think it's just engineering."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "It's also science."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "One thing that I find kind of interesting talking to physicists is a little bit, there's a, a little bit of hubris."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "Some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists, both philosophy and just in terms of mathematics, in terms of understanding the world."},

everything."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "Like this is the deepest thing to understand."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?"}, {"time": 4229, "text": "That's the old Rutherford thing."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "But to me, there's like, this is like a cake or something."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "There's layers to this thing and each one has a theory of everything."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Like at every level from biology, like how life originates, that itself, like complex systems."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing that requires a theory of everything."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "And then there's the, in the space of humans, psychology, like intelligence, collective intelligence, the way it emerges among species, that feels like a complex system that requires its own theory of everything."}, {"time": 4271, "text": "On top of that is things like in the computing space, artificial intelligence systems, like that feels like it needs a theory of everything."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And it's almost like once we solve, once we come up with a theory of everything that explains the basic laws of physics that gave us the universe, even stuff that's super complex, like how the universe might be able to originate, even explaining something that you're not a big fan of, like multiverses or stuff that we don't have any evidence of yet."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "Still, we won't be able to have a strong explanation of why food tastes delicious."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong with this terminology of theory of everything."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "And as you go to different levels of explanation, you're gonna need to develop new, different, completely different ideas, completely different ways of thinking."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Anderson's slogan is that, you know, more is different."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "And so it's just, even once you understand how, what a couple of things, if you have a collection of stuff and you understand perfectly well how each thing is interacting with the others, what the whole thing is gonna do is just a completely different problem."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "It's just not, and you need completely different ways of thinking about it."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "I got to ask you at a few different attempts that a theory of everything, especially recently."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "So I've been for many years, a big fan of cellular automata of complex systems."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "And obviously because of that, a fan of Stephen Wolfram's work in that space, but he's recently been talking about a theory of everything through his physics project, essentially."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "What do you think about this kind of discreet theory of everything like from simple rules and simple objects on the hypergraphs emerges all of our reality where time and space are emergent."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "Basically everything we see around us is emergent."},

don't see, it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And it really is just really, really doesn't agree at all with what I'm seeing, this kind of unification of math and physics that I'm kind of talking about around certain kinds of very deep ideas about geometry and stuff."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "This, if you want to believe that your things are really coming out of cellular automata at the most fundamental level, you have to believe that everything that I've seen my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas, that that's all just kind of a mirage, which just kind of randomly is emerging from these more basic, very, very simple minded things."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "And you have to give me some serious evidence for that and I'm seeing nothing."},

systems."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "I think from the point of view of certain mathematical point of view, quantum mechanics is already mathematically as simple as it gets."}, {"time": 4507, "text":

levels of mathematics that you're working with, they're exactly the same."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "So, and cellular automata are something completely different which don't fit into these structures."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And so I just don't see why, anyway, I don't see it as a promising thing to do."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "And then just looking at it and saying, does this go anywhere?"}, {"time": 4539, "text": "Does this solve any problem that I've ever, that I didn't, does this solve any problem of any kind?"}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs, I'm not sure solving a problem is even the standard to apply here at this moment."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks have no good answers."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So there's not good math explaining, forget the physics of it, math explaining the behavior of complex systems."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "Like we're at the very early days of understanding how complicated and fascinating things emerge from simple rules."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Yeah, and I agree."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "I think that is a truly great problem."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "And depending where it goes, it may be, it may start to develop some kind of connections to the things that I've kind of found more fruitful and hard to know."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "It just, I think a lot of that area, I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it because I just, I don't know too much about it."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "And again, we're back to this original problem that your time in life is limited."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "You have to figure out

kinds of objects that it feels like we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs on."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "And so it's like, you have to pick the problems that are solvable today."},

powerful computational tools to crack these problems open."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "That's if our approach to science, our ability to understand science, our ability to understand physics will become more and more computational, or there'll be a whole field that's computational in nature, which currently is not the case."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Currently, computation is the thing that

bit dramatic, but you know, if computers could do science on their own, computational systems, perhaps that's the way they would do the science."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "They would try to understand the cellular automata, and that feels like we're decades away."}, {"time": 4719, "text": "So perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets of this physics problem, but it's very far away."},

know how well you know Eric Weinstein."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Oh, quite well, yeah."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "What are your thoughts about his geometric community and the space of ideas that he's playing with in his proposal for theory of everything?"}, {"time": 4749, "text": "Well, I think that he has, he fundamentally has, I think, the same problems that everybody has had trying to do this, and there are really versions of the same problem that you try to get unity by putting everything into some bigger structure."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "So I just, anyway, it's the same, and there's another interesting example of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Leasy's theory of everything."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "And, because we don't see those symmetries in the real world, and so

is good, that should quite naturally lead to you being able to build a system that's intelligent."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "So you don't need to get approval from somebody that's saying you have a good idea here."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "You can just utilize that idea in an engineer system, like naturally leads to engineering."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "With physics here, if you have a

dimensions."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "So four dimensions behaves very, very specially unlike other dimensions."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "And in four dimensions, there is a way of thinking about space and time geometry, as well as just thinking about points in space and time."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "You can also think about different objects, these so called twisters."}, {"time": 5186,

terms of points of space and time, and you can reformulate in this Twister language."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And in this Twister language, it's the fundamental objects actually are more kind of

sphere."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And that what you're looking at is you're looking at, a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "And what Penrose says is that, well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere, that sphere of all the light rays coming in."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "And he says, and you should formulate your, instead of thinking about points, you should think about the space of those spheres, if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom as physics as living on those spheres, living on, so you're kind of living on, your degrees of freedom are living on light rays, not on points."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "And it's a very different way of thinking about physics."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "And he and others working with him

"There are some more technical ones."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "I should mean, I think it's also very convincing what it tells you about spinners, for instance, but that's a more technical."},

which you're operating."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "How that, I mean, first of all, like philosophically that's weird and beautiful, maybe because it maps, it feels like it moves us so much closer to the way human brains perceive reality."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "So it's almost like our perception is like the content of our perception is the fundamental object of reality."}, {"time": 5394,

to, for mathematicians, that's fine."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "We love doing that."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "But for most people, that makes it harder to think about."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "I think perhaps the most, the way that there is something you can say very specifically about it in terms of spinners, which I don't know if you want to, I think at some point you want to talk, so maybe you can."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "What are spinners?"}, {"time": 5453, "text": "Let's start with spinners, because I think that if we can introduce that, then I can say it."}, {"time": 5457, "text":

starting point."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "I don't know what is a good starting point for twister theory."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "Well, one thing you say about Penrose, I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer and also a very good draftsman."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "He's a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable, he actually has done some very nice drawings."}, {"time": 5483,

the, so spinners are something that independently came out of mathematics and out of physics."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "And to say where they came out of physics, I mean, what people realized when they started looking at elementary particles like electrons or whatever, that there seem to be some kind of doubling of the degrees of freedom going on."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "If you counted what was there in some sense in the way you would expect it and when you started doing quantum mechanics and started looking at elementary particles, there were seen to be two degrees of freedom, they're not one."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "And one way of seeing it was that if you put your electron in a strong magnetic field and asked what was the energy of it, instead of it having one energy, it would have two energies, there'd be two energy levels."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "And as you increase magnetic field, the splitting would increase."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "So we thought when we were doing, first started doing quantum mechanics, that the way to describe particles was in terms of wave functions and these wave functions were complex to complex values."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Well, if we actually look at particles, that that's not right."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "They're pairs of complex numbers."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "So one of the kind of fundamental, from the physics point of view, the fundamental question is why are all our kind of fundamental particles described by pairs of complex numbers?"}, {"time": 5575, "text": "Just weird."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "And then you can ask, well, what happens if you like take an electron and rotate it?"}, {"time": 5583, "text": "So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?"}, {"time": 5588, "text": "Well, now, if you go back to mathematics, what had been understood in mathematics, some years earlier, not that many years earlier, was that if you ask very, very generally, think about geometry of three dimensions and ask, and if you think about things that are happening in three dimensions in the standard way, everything, the standard way of doing geometry, everything is about vectors, right?"}, {"time": 5612, "text": "So if you've taken any mathematics classes, you probably see vectors at some point."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "They're just triplets of numbers tell you what a direction is or how far you're going in three dimensional space."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "And most of everything we teach in most standard courses in mathematics is about vectors and things you build out of vectors."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "So you express everything about geometry in terms of vectors or how they're changing or how you put two of them together and get planes and whatever."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "But what had been realized that, Rianna, is that if you ask very, very generally, what are the, if you have, what are the things that you can kind of consistently think about rotating?"}, {"time": 5653, "text": "And so you ask a technical question, what are the representations of the rotation group?"}, {"time": 5658, "text": "Well, you find that one answer is they're vectors and everything you build out of vectors, but then people found, but wait a minute, there's also these other things, which you can build out of vectors, but which you can consistently rotate."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "And they're described by pairs of complex numbers, by two complex numbers."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "And they're the spinners also."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "And to make a lot, and to make, and you can think of spinners in some sense as more fundamental than vectors because you can build vectors out of spinners."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You can take two spinners and make a vector, but you can't, if you only have vectors, you can't get spinners."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "So they're in some sense, there's some kind of level of lower level of geometry beyond what we thought it was, which was kind of spinner geometry."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "And this is something which even to this day, when we teach graduate courses in geometry, we mostly don't talk about this because it's a bit hard to do correctly."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "If you start with your whole setup is in terms of vectors, describing things in terms of spinners is a whole different ball game."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "But anyway, it was just this amazing fact that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry, spinners, and what we were actually seeing, if you look at electron, are one and the same."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So it's, I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing, but it's very counterintuitive."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "What are some weird properties of spinners that are counterintuitive?"}, {"time": 5750, "text": "That there are some things that they do, for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees, it doesn't come back towards, it becomes minus what it was."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "Or, so it's, anyway, so the way rotations work, there's a kind of a funny sign you have to keep track of in some sense."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "So they're kind of too valued in another weird way."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "But the fundamental problem is that it's just not, if you're used to visualizing vectors, you just, there's nothing you can do visualizing in terms of vectors that will ever give you a spinner."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "It just is not gonna ever work."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector walking along a Mobius strip, and it ends up being upside down."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "But you're saying that doesn't really capture."}, {"time": 5794, "text": "So, I mean, what really captures it?"}, {"time": 5796, "text": "The problem is that it's really, the simplest way to describe it is in terms of two complex numbers."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "And your problem with two complex numbers is that's four real numbers."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "So you, that makes it hard to visualize."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions."}, {"time": 5817, "text": "It's just, it's actually complex numbers."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "You're really gonna use the fact that these are two complex numbers."}, {"time": 5823, "text": "So it's very hard to visualize."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "But to get back to what I think is mind blowing about twisters is that the, another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres, another way of saying the fundamental idea of twister theory is in some sense, the fundamental idea of twister theory is that a point is a two complex dimensional space."}, {"time": 5848, "text": "So that every, and that it lives inside, the space that it lies inside is twister space."}, {"time": 5854, "text": "So in the simplest case, it's four, twister space is four dimensional and a point in space time is a two complex dimensional subspace of all the four complex dimensions."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And as you move around in space time, you're just moving, your planes are just moving around."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And that, but then the."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "So it's a plane in a four dimensional space."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "It's a plane."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "Complex."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "Complex plane."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "So it's two complex dimensions in four complex."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "But then to me, the mind blowing thing about this is this then kind of tautologically answers the question is what is a spinner?"}, {"time": 5890, "text": "Well, a spinner is a point."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "And you want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "So it's, you know, just your whole definition of what a point in space time was just told you what a spinner was."}, {"time": 5915, "text": "It's, they're just, it's the same thing."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "Yeah, but we're trying to project that into a three dimensional space and trying to intuit, but you can't."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult, but from, if you don't, not using twister theory, you have to kind of go through a certain fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners to describe electrons."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "Whereas using twister theory, it's just completely tautological."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "They're just what you want to describe."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "The electron is fundamentally the way that you're describing the point in space time already."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "It's just there, so."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "You mentioned that you found it appealing recently."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "Is it just because of certain aspects of its mathematical beauty, or do you actually have a hope that this might lead to a theory of everything?"}, {"time": 5962, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope because what I've found, I think the thing which I've done, which I don't think, as far as I can tell, no one had really looked at from this point of view before is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time in your quantum theory?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "And so there's another long story about how we do quantum theories and about how we treat time in quantum theories, which is a long story."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "But the short version of it is that what people have found when you try and write down a quantum theory, that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate, whatever you're using to your time coordinate, and multiply it by the square root of minus one and to make it purely imaginary."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "And so all these formulas, which you have in your standard theory, if you do that to those, I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior and they're kind of singular."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "If you ask even some simple questions, you have to take very delicate singular limits in order to get the correct answer, and you have to take them from the right direction, otherwise it doesn't work."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "Whereas if you just take time, and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one, wherever you see the time coordinate, you end up with much simpler formulas, which are much better behaved mathematically."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "And what I hadn't really appreciated until fairly recently is also how dramatically that changes the whole structure of the theory."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "You end up with a consistent way of talking about these quantum theories, but it has some very different flavor and very different aspects that I hadn't really appreciated."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "And in particular, the way symmetries act on it is not at all what I originally had expected."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "And so that's the new thing that I have, or I think gives you something, is to do this move, which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical trick that you're doing to make some formulas work out nicely, but to take that mathematical trick as really fundamental."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "And it turns out in Twister theory allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time and the time times the square root of minus one, they both fit very nicely into Twister theory."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And you end up with some structures which look a lot like the standard models."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "Do you think there will be, there was a bet between Michio Kaku and somebody else about."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "John Horgan."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "John Horgan about, by the way, maybe discover a cool website, longbets.com or.org."}, {"time":

and you make a bet about what's going to happen in 20 years."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "You don't realize 20 years just goes like this."}, {"time": 6151, "text": "And then you get to face out and you get to wonder what was that person?"}, {"time": 6159, "text": "What was I thinking?"}, {"time": 6161, "text": "That person 20 years ago was almost like a different person."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "What was I thinking back then to think that?"}, {"time": 6167, "text": "So let me ask you this on record, 20 years from now or some number of years from now, do you think there will be a Nobel Prize given for something directly connected to a first broadly theory of everything?"}, {"time": 6181, "text": "And second, of course, one of the possibilities, one of them, string theory?"}, {"time": 6190, "text": "String theory, definitely not."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Things have gone, yeah."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "So if you were giving financial advice, you would say not to bet on that?"}, {"time": 6199, "text": "No, do not."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "And even, I actually suspect if you ask string theorists that question, you're gonna get a few of them saying, I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20 years ago, again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever, I think some of them would have taken you up on it."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "And certainly back in 1984, a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "But now I get the impression that even they realize that things are not looking good for that particular idea."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "Again, it depends what you mean by string theory, whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else, which will work out."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "But I don't think that's not gonna like it to work out, whether something else."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "I mean, I still think it's relatively unlikely that you'll have any really successful theory of everything."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "And the main problem is just the, it's become so difficult to do experiments at higher energy that we've really lost this ability to kind of get unexpected input from experiment."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "And you can, while it's maybe hard to figure out what people's thinking is gonna be 20 years from now, looking at high energy particle, high energy colliders and their technology, it's actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess what you're gonna be doing 20 years from now."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "And I think actually, I would actually claim that it's pretty clear where you're gonna be 20 years from now."}, {"time": 6284, "text": "And what it's gonna be is you're gonna have the LHC, you're gonna have a lot more data, an order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,

learning or great sort of data science methodologies that process that data will not reveal any major shifts in our understanding of the underlying physics, you think?"}, {"time": 6320, "text": "I mean, I think that field, my understanding is they're starting to make a great use of those techniques, but it seems to look like it will help them solve certain technical problems and be able to do things somewhat better, but not completely change the way they're looking at things."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "What do you think about the potential quantum computers simulating quantum mechanical systems and through that sneak up to sort of through simulation, sneak up to a deep understanding of the fundamental physics?"}, {"time": 6351, "text": "The problem there is that that's promising more for this, for Phil Anderson's problem, that if you wanna, there's lots and lots of, you start putting together lots and lots of things and we think we know they're pair by pair interactions, but what this thing is gonna do, we don't have any good calculational techniques."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "Quantum computers may very well give you those."}, {"time": 6379, "text": "And so they may, what we

ridiculous sounding, but I don't think it's actually a ridiculous question of do you think we live in a simulation?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "Do you find that thought experiment at all useful or interesting?"}, {"time": 6420, "text": "Not really, I don't, it just doesn't."}, {"time": 6423, "text": "Yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn't actually lead to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere

stuff."}, {"time": 6522, "text": "You could just look at the basic physics and who cares what the computer it's running on is."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of, I mean,

full range of mysteries in our universe?"}, {"time": 6730, "text": "That's a complicated issue."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back and go back to like what inspired me and maybe to connect it a little bit to this question about books."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "I mean, certainly when the books, some books that I remember reading when I was a kid were about the early history of quantum mechanics, like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you know, kind of looking back at telling the history of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "It's just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic, great story, and those were very inspirational to me."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "And I would think maybe other people might also find them that, but the... And that's almost like the human story of the development of the ideas."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "Yeah, the human story, but yeah, just also how, you know, there are these very, very weird ideas that didn't seem to make sense, and how they were struggling with them and how, you know, they actually..."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "Anyway, it's, I think it's the period of physics kind of beginning, you know, 1905 with Planck and Einstein and ending up with the war when these things get used to, you know, make massively destructive weapons."}, {"time": 6794, "text": "It's just the truly amazing... And so many, so many new ideas."}, {"time": 6797, "text": "Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent on top of a tangent, ask, if we didn't have Einstein, so how does science progress?"},

form in some ways, but I think special relativity you would have had without Einstein fairly quickly."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "General relativity, that was a much, much harder thing to do and

serious work."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "And if he hadn't been around to do that, it would have taken a while before anyone else got around to it."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "On the other hand, there

this really intrinsic to our minds?"}, {"time": 6942, "text": "If you start out with a different kind of mind when you end up with a different ideas of what fundamental physics is or what the

would like throw miracles at them to like, to mess with them and stuff."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And then I would also like to run Earth from the very beginning to see if evolution will produce different kinds of brains that would then produce different kinds of mathematics and physics."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "And then finally, I would probably millions of times run the universe over to

books."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "Yeah, so and then, yeah, so that's one thing I'd recommend is the books about the, from the original people, especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened."},

I can say is that, so that book, I think, I forget when it was, late 80s, 90s."}, {"time": 7100, "text": "The problem is that there just hasn't been much that's actually worked out since then."},

are, which actually don't really work."}, {"time": 7115, "text": "And it's really, the argument people sometimes make in favor of these books as well, oh, they're really great because you want to do something that will get kids excited."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "And then, so they're getting excited about things, something that's not really quite working."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "It doesn't really matter, the main thing is get them excited."}, {"time": 7130, "text": "The other argument is, wait a minute, if you're getting people excited about ideas that are wrong, you're really kind of,

about expository stuff is, yeah, it's to the extent you can do it kind of honestly and, well, that's great."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "There are a lot of people doing that now, but to the extent that

chess."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "To me, that may not be intelligence, but it sure as heck seems like a few steps down the path towards intelligence."}, {"time": 7204, "text": "And so I think that's a very peculiar property of systems that can be engineered."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "So even if the idea is fuzzy, even if you're not really sure what intelligence is, or if you don't have a deep fundamental understanding or even a model what intelligence is, if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive and showing some of the signs of what previously thought impossible for a nonintelligent system, then that's impressive and that's inspiring and that's okay to celebrate."}, {"time": 7236, "text": "In physics, because you're not engineering anything, you're just now

well, the problem, I think physics is, I think it's actually hard for people even to believe or really understand how that this particular kind of physics has gotten itself into a really unusual and strange and historically unusual state, which is not really."}, {"time": 7266, "text": "I mean, I spent half my life among mathematicians and half of the physicists, and mathematics is kind of doing fine."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "People are making progress and it has all the usual problems, but also, so you could have a, but I just, I don't know, I've never seen anything at all happening in mathematics like what's happened in this specific area in physics."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "It's just the kind of sociology of this, the way this field works banging up against this harder problem without anything from experiment to help it."}, {"time": 7298, "text": "It's really, it's led to some really kind of problematic things."}, {"time": 7303, "text": "And those, so it's one thing to kind of oversimplify or to slightly misrepresent, to try to explain things in a way that's not quite right, but it's another thing to start promoting to people as a success as ideas, which really completely failed."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "And so, I mean, I've kind of a very, very specific, if you used to have people, I won't name any names, for instance, coming on certain podcasts like yours, telling the world, this is a huge success and this is really wonderful."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "And this is really problematic and it carries a serious danger of once, when people realize that this is what's going on, that the loss of credibility of science is a real, real problem for our society."}, {"time": 7354, "text": "And you don't want people to have an all too good reason to think that what they're being told by kind of some of the best institutions or a country or authorities is not true."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "You know, it's not true, it's a problem."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "That's obviously characteristic of not just physics, it's sociology."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics, it's the history of politics is you sell ideas to people, even when you don't have any proof that those ideas actually work in the US because if they've worked in that, that seems to be the case throughout history."}, {"time": 7403, "text": "And just like you said, it's human beings running up against a really hard problem."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "I'm not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory through the progress of physics that we're dealing with now or it's just a natural progress of science."}, {"time": 7420, "text": "You run up against a really difficult stage of a field and different people behave differently in the face of that."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "Some sell books and sort of tell narratives that are beautiful and so on."}, {"time": 7437, "text": "They're not necessarily grounded in solutions that have proven themselves."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "Others kind of put their head down quietly, keep doing the work."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "Others sort of pivot to different fields and that's kind of like, yeah, ants scattering."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And then you have fields like machine learning, which there was a few folks mostly scattered away from machine learning in the 90s, in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "But a few people kept their head down and now they're called the fathers of deep learning."}, {"time": 7467,

to a particular thing."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying that we should be careful over hyping things that have not proven themselves because people will lose trust in the scientific process."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "But unfortunately, there's been other ways in which people have lost trust in the scientific process."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "That

think in the sense that there's a lot of public fascination with it that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions about what is this physical reality?"}, {"time": 7527, "text": "Where do we come from?"}, {"time": 7528, "text": "And these kind of deep issues."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So there's this unusual fascination with it."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "Mathematics is very different."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "Nobody's that interested in mathematics."}, {"time": 7536, "text": "Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great, deep things about the world from mathematics that much."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "They don't ask mathematicians that."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "So it's a very unusual, it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "And it really is historically in a really unusual state."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "It's gotten itself way kind of down a blind alley in a way which it's hard to find other historical parallels to."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "But sort of to push back a little bit, there's power to inspiring people."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And if I just empirically look, physicists are really good at combining science and philosophy and communicating it."}, {"time": 7584, "text": "Like there's something about physics often that forces you to build a strong intuition about the way reality works, right?"}, {"time": 7591, "text": "And that allows you to think through sort of and communicate about all kinds of questions."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "Like if you see physicists, it's always fascinating to take on problems that have nothing to do with their particular discipline."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "They think in interesting ways and they're able to communicate their thinking in interesting ways."}, {"time": 7608, "text": "And so in some sense, they have a responsibility not just to do science, but to inspire."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "And not responsibility, but the opportunity."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "But I don't know, anyway, it's hard to say because there's many, many people doing this kind of thing with different degrees of success and whatever."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "Well, in general, for graduate students, for people who seek to be experts in the field, diversity of ideas is really powerful and is getting into this local pocket of ideas that people hold on to for several decades is not good, no matter what the idea."}, {"time": 7724, "text": "I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong, because there's no such thing as right in the long term, like it's right for now until somebody builds on something much bigger on top of it."}, {"time":

thing that I think it's very interesting that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things to say about it."}, {"time": 7763, "text": "And I think also Lee Smolin in his book, which is also about that very much in agreement with them that there's a really kind of important questions about how research in this field is organized and what can you do to kind of get more diversity of thought and
