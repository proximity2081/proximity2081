[{"title": "Chris Lattner: Compilers, LLVM, Swift, TPU, and ML Accelerators | Lex Fridman Podcast #21", "id": "yCd3CzGSte8", "quotes": [{"time": 262, "text": "Let's talk about LLVM, C lang, and compilers."}, {"time": 266, "text": "So can you tell me first what LLVM and C lang are?"}, {"time": 272, "text": "And how is it that you find yourself the creator and lead developer, one of the most powerful compiler optimization systems in use today?"}, {"time": 280, "text": "So I guess they're different things."}, {"time": 283, "text": "So let's start with what is a compiler?"}, {"time": 287, "text": "Is that a good place to start?"}, {"time": 288, "text": "What are the phases of a compiler?"}, {"time": 290, "text": "Where are the parts?"}, {"time": 290, "text": "Yeah, what is it?"}, {"time": 291, "text": "So what is even a compiler used for?"}, {"time": 293, "text": "So the way I look at this is you have a two sided problem of you have humans that need to write code."}, {"time": 300, "text": "And then you have machines that need to run the program that the human wrote."}, {"time": 303, "text": "And for lots of reasons, the humans don't want to be writing in binary and want to think about every piece of hardware."}, {"time": 309, "text": "And so at the same time that you have lots of humans, you also have lots of kinds of hardware."}, {"time": 314, "text": "And so compilers are the art of allowing humans to think at a level of abstraction that they want to think about."}, {"time": 320, "text": "And then get that program, get the thing that they wrote, to run on a specific piece of hardware."}, {"time": 326, "text": "And the interesting and exciting part of all this is that there's now lots of different kinds of hardware, chips like x86 and PowerPC and ARM and things like that."}, {"time": 335, "text": "But also high performance accelerators for machine learning and other things like that are also just different kinds of hardware, GPUs."}, {"time": 341, "text": "These are new kinds of hardware."}, {"time": 342, "text": "And at the same time, on the programming side of it, you have basic, you have C, you have JavaScript, you have Python, you have Swift."}, {"time": 350, "text": "You have lots of other languages that are all trying to talk to the human in a different way to make them more expressive and capable and powerful."}, {"time": 358, "text": "And so compilers are the thing that goes from one to the other."}, {"time": 363, "text": "End to end, from the very beginning to the very end."}, {"time": 365, "text": "End to end."}, {"time": 366, "text": "And so you go from what the human wrote and programming languages end up being about expressing intent, not just for the compiler and the hardware, but the programming language's job is really to capture an expression of what the programmer wanted that then can be maintained and adapted and evolved by other humans, as well as interpreted by the compiler."}, {"time": 389, "text": "So when you look at this problem, you have, on the one hand, humans, which are complicated."}, {"time": 394, "text": "And you have hardware, which is complicated."}, {"time": 396, "text": "And so compilers typically work in multiple phases."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And so the software engineering challenge that you have here is try to get maximum reuse out of the amount of code that you write, because these compilers are very complicated."}, {"time": 409, "text": "And so the way it typically works out is that you have something called a front end or a parser that is language specific."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And so you'll have a C parser, and that's what Clang is, or C++ or JavaScript or Python or whatever."}, {"time": 423, "text": "That's the front end."}, {"time": 425, "text": "Then you'll have a middle part, which is often the optimizer."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And then you'll have a late part, which is hardware specific."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And so compilers end up, there's many different layers often, but these three big groups are very common in compilers."}, {"time": 440, "text": "And what LLVM is trying to do is trying to standardize that middle and last part."}, {"time": 445, "text": "And so one of the cool things about LLVM is that there are a lot of different languages that compile through to it."}, {"time": 451, "text": "And so things like Swift, but also Julia, Rust, Clang for C, C++, Subjective C, like these are all very different languages and they can all use the same optimization infrastructure, which gets better performance, and the same code generation infrastructure for hardware support."}, {"time": 468, "text": "And so LLVM is really that layer that is common, that all these different specific compilers can use."}, {"time": 475, "text": "And is it a standard, like a specification, or is it literally an implementation?"}, {"time": 481, "text": "It's an implementation."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And so I think there's a couple of different ways of looking at it, right?"}, {"time": 486, "text": "Because it depends on which angle you're looking at it from."}, {"time": 489, "text": "LLVM ends up being a bunch of code, okay?"}, {"time": 492, "text": "So it's a bunch of code that people reuse and they build compilers with."}, {"time": 496, "text": "We call it a compiler infrastructure because it's kind of the underlying platform that you build a concrete compiler on top of."}, {"time": 502, "text": "But it's also a community."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And the LLVM community is hundreds of people that all collaborate."}, {"time": 507, "text": "And one of the most fascinating things about LLVM over the course of time is that we've managed somehow to successfully get harsh competitors in the commercial space to collaborate on shared infrastructure."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And so you have Google and Apple, you have AMD and Intel, you have Nvidia and AMD on the graphics side, you have Cray and everybody else doing these things."}, {"time": 532, "text": "And all these companies are collaborating together to make that shared infrastructure really, really great."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And they do this not out of the goodness of their heart, but they do it because it's in their commercial interest of having really great infrastructure that they can build on top of and facing the reality that it's so expensive that no one company, even the big companies, no one company really wants to implement it all themselves."}, {"time": 554, "text": "Expensive or difficult?"}, {"time": 556, "text": "That's a great point because it's also about the skill sets."}, {"time": 560, "text": "And the skill sets are very hard to find."}, {"time": 566, "text": "How big is the LLVM?"}, {"time": 567, "text": "It always seems like with open source projects, the kind, an LLVM is open source?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "Yes, it's open source."}, {"time": 574, "text": "It's about, it's 19 years old now, so it's fairly old."}, {"time": 578, "text": "It seems like the magic often happens within a very small circle of people."}, {"time": 583, "text": "At least their early birth and whatever."}, {"time": 586, "text": "Yes, so the LLVM came from a university project, and so I was at the University of Illinois."}, {"time": 591, "text": "And there it was myself, my advisor, and then a team of two or three research students in the research group, and we built many of the core pieces initially."}, {"time": 602, "text": "I then graduated and went to Apple, and at Apple brought it to the products, first in the OpenGL graphics stack, but eventually to the C compiler realm, and eventually built Clang, and eventually built Swift and these things."}, {"time": 614, "text": "Along the way, building a team of people that are really amazing compiler engineers that helped build a lot of that."}, {"time": 620, "text": "And so as it was gaining momentum and as Apple was using it, being open source and public and encouraging contribution, many others, for example, at Google, came in and started contributing."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And in some cases, Google effectively owns Clang now because it cares so much about C++ and the evolution of that ecosystem, and so it's investing a lot in the C++ world and the tooling and things like that."}, {"time": 642, "text": "And so likewise, NVIDIA cares a lot about CUDA."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And so CUDA uses Clang and uses LLVM for graphics and GPGPU."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And so when you first started as a master's project, I guess, did you think it was gonna go as far as it went?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "Were you crazy ambitious about it?"}, {"time": 667, "text": "It seems like a really difficult undertaking, a brave one."}, {"time": 669, "text": "Yeah, no, no, no, it was nothing like that."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So my goal when I went to the University of Illinois was to get in and out with a non thesis masters in a year and get back to work."}, {"time": 678, "text": "So I was not planning to stay for five years and build this massive infrastructure."}, {"time": 684, "text": "I got nerd sniped into staying."}, {"time": 687, "text": "And a lot of it was because LLVM was fun and I was building cool stuff and learning really interesting things and facing both software engineering challenges, but also learning how to work in a team and things like that."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I had worked at many companies as interns before that, but it was really a different thing to have a team of people that are working together and try and collaborate in version control."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And it was just a little bit different."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Like I said, I just talked to Don Knuth and he believes that 2% of the world population have something weird with their brain, that they're geeks, they understand computers, they're connected with computers."}, {"time": 722, "text": "He put it at exactly 2%."}, {"time": 725, "text": "He's a specific guy."}, {"time": 726, "text": "It's very specific."}, {"time": 728, "text": "Well, he says, I can't prove it, but it's very empirically there."}, {"time": 733, "text": "Is there something that attracts you to the idea of optimizing code?"}, {"time": 736, "text": "And he seems like that's one of the biggest, coolest things about LLVM."}, {"time": 740, "text": "Yeah, that's one of the major things it does."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So I got into that because of a person, actually."}, {"time": 746, "text": "So when I was in my undergraduate, I had an advisor, or a professor named Steve Vegdahl."}, {"time": 752, "text": "And he, I went to this little tiny private school."}, {"time": 755, "text": "There were like seven or nine people in my computer science department, students in my class."}, {"time": 763, "text": "So it was a very tiny, very small school."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It was kind of a wart on the side of the math department kind of a thing at the time."}, {"time": 771, "text": "I think it's evolved a lot in the many years since then."}, {"time": 773, "text": "But Steve Vegdahl was a compiler guy."}, {"time": 778, "text": "And he was super passionate."}, {"time": 779, "text": "And his passion rubbed off on me."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And one of the things I like about compilers is that they're large, complicated software pieces."}, {"time": 789, "text": "And so one of the culminating classes that many computer science departments, at least at the time, did was to say that you would take algorithms and data structures and all these core classes."}, {"time": 799, "text": "But then the compilers class was one of the last classes you take because it pulls everything together."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And then you work on one piece of code over the entire semester."}, {"time": 808, "text": "And so you keep building on your own work, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 813, "text": "And it's also very challenging because in many classes, if you don't get a project done, you just forget about it and move on to the next one and get your B or whatever it is."}, {"time": 821, "text": "But here you have to live with the decisions you make and continue to reinvest in it."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And I really like that."}, {"time": 828, "text": "And so I did an extra study project with him the following semester."}, {"time": 832, "text": "And he was just really great."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And he was also a great mentor in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 836, "text": "And so from him and from his advice, he encouraged me to go to graduate school."}, {"time": 841, "text": "I wasn't super excited about going to grad school."}, {"time": 843, "text": "I wanted the master's degree, but I didn't want to be an academic."}, {"time": 848, "text": "But like I said, I kind of got tricked into saying and was having a lot of fun."}, {"time": 852, "text": "And I definitely do not regret it."}, {"time": 854, "text": "What aspects of compilers were the things you connected with?"}, {"time": 857, "text": "So LLVM, there's also the other part that's really interesting if you're interested in languages is parsing and just analyzing the language, breaking it down, parsing, and so on."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Was that interesting to you, or were you more interested in optimization?"}, {"time": 874, "text": "For me, it was more so I'm not really a math person."}, {"time": 877, "text": "I could do math."}, {"time": 878, "text": "I understand some bits of it when I get into it."}, {"time": 881, "text": "But math is never the thing that attracted me."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And so a lot of the parser part of the compiler has a lot of good formal theories that Don, for example, knows quite well."}, {"time": 890, "text": "I'm still waiting for his book on that."}, {"time": 894, "text": "But I just like building a thing and seeing what it could do and exploring and getting it to do more things and then setting new goals and reaching for them."}, {"time": 904, "text": "And in the case of LLVM, when I started working on that, my research advisor that I was working for was a compiler guy."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And so he and I specifically found each other because we were both interested in compilers."}, {"time": 916, "text": "And so I started working with him and taking his class."}, {"time": 919, "text": "And a lot of LLVM initially was, it's fun implementing all the standard algorithms and all the things that people had been talking about and were well known."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And they were in the curricula for advanced studies and compilers."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And so just being able to build that was really fun."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And I was learning a lot by, instead of reading about it, just building."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And so I enjoyed that."}, {"time": 940, "text": "So you said compilers are these complicated systems."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Can you even just with language try to describe how you turn a C++ program into code?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "Like, what are the hard parts?"}, {"time": 953, "text": "Why is it so hard?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "So I'll give you examples of the hard parts along the way."}, {"time": 957, "text": "So C++ is a very complicated programming language."}, {"time": 961, "text": "It's something like 1,400 pages in the spec."}, {"time": 963, "text": "So C++ by itself is crazy complicated."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Can we just pause?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "What makes the language complicated in terms of what's syntactically?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "So it's what they call syntax."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So the actual how the characters are arranged, yes."}, {"time": 976, "text": "It's also semantics, how it behaves."}, {"time": 980, "text": "It's also, in the case of C++, there's a huge amount of history."}, {"time": 983, "text": "C++ is built on top of C. You play that forward."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And then a bunch of suboptimal, in some cases, decisions were made, and they compound."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And then more and more and more things keep getting added to C++, and it will probably never stop."}, {"time": 996, "text": "But the language is very complicated from that perspective."}, {"time": 999, "text": "And so the interactions between subsystems is very complicated."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "There's just a lot there."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And when you talk about the front end, one of the major challenges, which clang as a project, the C, C++ compiler that I built, I and many people built, one of the challenges we took on was we looked at GCC."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "GCC, at the time, was a really good industry standardized compiler that had really consolidated a lot of the other compilers in the world and was a standard."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "But it wasn't really great for research."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "The design was very difficult to work with."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And it was full of global variables and other things that made it very difficult to reuse in ways that it wasn't originally designed for."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "And so with clang, one of the things that we wanted to do is push forward on better user interface, so make error messages that are just better than GCC's."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "And that's actually hard, because you have to do a lot of bookkeeping in an efficient way to be able to do that."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "We want to make compile time better."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And so compile time is about making it efficient, which is also really hard when you're keeping track of extra information."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "We wanted to make new tools available, so refactoring tools and other analysis tools that GCC never supported, also leveraging the extra information we kept, but enabling those new classes of tools that then get built into IDEs."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And so that's been one of the areas that clang has really helped push the world forward in, is in the tooling for C and C++ and things like that."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "But C++ and the front end piece is complicated."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "And you have to build syntax trees."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "And you have to check every rule in the spec."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And you have to turn that back into an error message to the human that the human can understand when they do something wrong."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "But then you start doing what's called lowering, so going from C++ and the way that it represents code down to the machine."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And when you do that, there's many different phases you go through."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "Often, there are, I think LLVM has something like 150 different what are called passes in the compiler that the code passes through."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And these get organized in very complicated ways, which affect the generated code and the performance and compile time and many other things."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "What are they passing through?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So after you do the clang parsing, what's the graph?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "What does it look like?"}, {"time": 1134, "text": "What's the data structure here?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Yeah, so in the parser, it's usually a tree."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And it's called an abstract syntax tree."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And so the idea is you have a node for the plus that the human wrote in their code."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Or the function call, you'll have a node for call with the function that they call and the arguments they pass, things like that."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "This then gets lowered into what's called an intermediate representation."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "And intermediate representations are like LLVM has one."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "And there, it's what's called a control flow graph."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "And so you represent each operation in the program as a very simple, like this is going to add two numbers."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "This is going to multiply two things."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Maybe we'll do a call."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "But then they get put in what are called blocks."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And so you get blocks of these straight line operations, where instead of being nested like in a tree, it's straight line operations."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And so there's a sequence and an ordering to these operations."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So within the block or outside the block?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "That's within the block."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And so it's a straight line sequence of operations within the block."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And then you have branches, like conditional branches, between blocks."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And so when you write a loop, for example, in a syntax tree, you would have a for node, like for a for statement in a C like language, you'd have a for node."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And you have a pointer to the expression for the initializer, a pointer to the expression for the increment, a pointer to the expression for the comparison, a pointer to the body."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And these are all nested underneath it."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "In a control flow graph, you get a block for the code that runs before the loop, so the initializer code."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And you have a block for the body of the loop."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "And so the body of the loop code goes in there, but also the increment and other things like that."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "And then you have a branch that goes back to the top and a comparison and a branch that goes out."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And so it's more of an assembly level kind of representation."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "But the nice thing about this level of representation is it's much more language independent."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And so there's lots of different kinds of languages with different kinds of, you know, JavaScript has a lot of different ideas of what is false, for example."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And all that can stay in the front end."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "But then that middle part can be shared across all those."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "How close is that intermediate representation to neural networks, for example?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Are they, because everything you describe is a kind of echoes of a neural network graph."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Are they neighbors or what?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "They're quite different in details, but they're very similar in idea."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "So one of the things that neural networks do is they learn representations for data at different levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then they transform those through layers, right?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So the compiler does very similar things."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "But one of the things the compiler does is it has relatively few different representations."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Where a neural network often, as you get deeper, for example, you get many different representations in each layer or set of ops."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "It's transforming between these different representations."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "In a compiler, often you get one representation and they do many transformations to it."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And these transformations are often applied iteratively."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And for programmers, there's familiar types of things."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "For example, trying to find expressions inside of a loop and pulling them out of a loop so they execute for times."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "Or find redundant computation."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Or find constant folding or other simplifications, turning two times x into x shift left by one."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And things like this are all the examples of the things that happen."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "But compilers end up getting a lot of theorem proving and other kinds of algorithms that try to find higher level properties of the program that then can be used by the optimizer."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So what's the biggest bang for the buck with optimization?"}, {"time": 1358, "text": "Today?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Well, no, not even today."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "At the very beginning, the 80s, I don't know."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Yeah, so for the 80s, a lot of it was things like register allocation."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "So the idea of in a modern microprocessor, what you'll end up having is you'll end up having memory, which is relatively slow."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And then you have registers that are relatively fast."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "But registers, you don't have very many of them."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "And so when you're writing a bunch of code, you're just saying, compute this, put in a temporary variable, compute this, compute this, compute this, put in a temporary variable."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "I have a loop."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I have some other stuff going on."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Well, now you're running on an x86, like a desktop PC or something."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Well, it only has, in some cases, some modes, eight registers."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And so now the compiler has to choose what values get put in what registers at what points in the program."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And this is actually a really big deal."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "So if you think about, you have a loop, an inner loop that executes millions of times maybe."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "If you're doing loads and stores inside that loop, then it's going to be really slow."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "But if you can somehow fit all the values inside that loop in registers, now it's really fast."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And so getting that right requires a lot of work, because there's many different ways to do that."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And often what the compiler ends up doing is it ends up thinking about things in a different representation than what the human wrote."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "You wrote into x."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Well, the compiler thinks about that as four different values, each which have different lifetimes across the function that it's in."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "And each of those could be put in a register or memory or different memory or maybe in some parts of the code recomputed instead of stored and reloaded."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "And there are many of these different kinds of techniques that can be used."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So it's adding almost like a time dimension to it's trying to optimize across time."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So it's considering when you're programming, you're not thinking in that way."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And so the RISC era made things."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So RISC chips, R I S C. The RISC chips, as opposed to CISC chips."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "The RISC chips made things more complicated for the compiler, because what they ended up doing is ending up adding pipelines to the processor, where the processor can do more than one thing at a time."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "But this means that the order of operations matters a lot."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "So one of the classical compiler techniques that you use is called scheduling."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And so moving the instructions around so that the processor can keep its pipelines full instead of stalling and getting blocked."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And so there's a lot of things like that that are kind of bread and butter compiler techniques that have been studied a lot over the course of decades now."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "But the engineering side of making them real is also still quite hard."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "And you talk about machine learning."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "This is a huge opportunity for machine learning, because many of these algorithms are full of these hokey, hand rolled heuristics, which work well on specific benchmarks that don't generalize, and full of magic numbers."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "And I hear there's some techniques that are good at handling that."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So what would be the, if you were to apply machine learning to this, what's the thing you're trying to optimize?"}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Is it ultimately the running time?"}, {"time": 1539, "text": "You can pick your metric, and there's running time, there's memory use, there's lots of different things that you can optimize for."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Code size is another one that some people care about in the embedded space."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Is this like the thinking into the future, or has somebody actually been crazy enough to try to have machine learning based parameter tuning for the optimization of compilers?"}, {"time": 1561, "text": "So this is something that is, I would say, research right now."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "There are a lot of research systems that have been applying search in various forms."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And using reinforcement learning is one form, but also brute force search has been tried for quite a while."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And usually, these are in small problem spaces."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So find the optimal way to code generate a matrix multiply for a GPU, something like that, where you say, there, there's a lot of design space of, do you unroll loops a lot?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "Do you execute multiple things in parallel?"}, {"time": 1592, "text": "And there's many different confounding factors here because graphics cards have different numbers of threads and registers and execution ports and memory bandwidth and many different constraints that interact in nonlinear ways."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And so search is very powerful for that."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And it gets used in certain ways, but it's not very structured."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "This is something that we need, we as an industry need to fix."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So you said 80s, but like, so have there been like big jumps in improvement and optimization?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Yeah, since then, what's the coolest thing?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "It's largely been driven by hardware."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "So, well, it's hardware and software."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "So in the mid nineties, Java totally changed the world, right?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And I'm still amazed by how much change was introduced by the way or in a good way."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So like reflecting back, Java introduced things like, all at once introduced things like JIT compilation."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "None of these were novel, but it pulled it together and made it mainstream and made people invest in it."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "JIT compilation, garbage collection, portable code, safe code, like memory safe code, like a very dynamic dispatch execution model."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Like many of these things, which had been done in research systems and had been done in small ways in various places, really came to the forefront, really changed how things worked and therefore changed the way people thought about the problem."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "JavaScript was another major world change based on the way it works."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "But also on the hardware side of things, multi core and vector instructions really change the problem space and are very, they don't remove any of the problems that compilers faced in the past, but they add new kinds of problems of how do you find enough work to keep a four wide vector busy, right?"}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Or if you're doing a matrix multiplication, how do you do different columns out of that matrix at the same time?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "And how do you maximally utilize the arithmetic compute that one core has?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "And then how do you take it to multiple cores?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "How did the whole virtual machine thing change the compilation pipeline?"}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Yeah, so what the Java virtual machine does is it splits, just like I was talking about before, where you have a front end that parses the code, and then you have an intermediate representation that gets transformed."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "What Java did was they said, we will parse the code and then compile to what's known as Java byte code."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And that byte code is now a portable code representation that is industry standard and locked down and can't change."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "And then the back part of the compiler that does optimization and code generation can now be built by different vendors."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And Java byte code can be shipped around across the wire."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "It's memory safe and relatively trusted."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And because of that, it can run in the browser."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And that's why it runs in the browser, right?"}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And so that way you can be in, again, back in the day, you would write a Java applet and as a web developer, you'd build this mini app that would run on a webpage."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "Well, a user of that is running a web browser on their computer."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "You download that Java byte code, which can be trusted, and then you do all the compiler stuff on your machine so that you know that you trust that."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Now, is that a good idea or a bad idea?"}, {"time": 1784, "text": "I mean, it's a great idea for certain problems."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And I'm very much a believer that technology is itself neither good nor bad."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "It's how you apply it."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "You know, this would be a very, very bad thing for very low levels of the software stack."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "But in terms of solving some of these software portability and transparency, or portability problems, I think it's been really good."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "Now, Java ultimately didn't win out on the desktop."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And like, there are good reasons for that."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "But it's been very successful on servers and in many places, it's been a very successful thing over decades."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So what has been LLVMs and C langs improvements and optimization that throughout its history, what are some moments we had set back and really proud of what's been accomplished?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "Yeah, I think that the interesting thing about LLVM is not the innovations and compiler research."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "It has very good implementations of various important algorithms, no doubt."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "And a lot of really smart people have worked on it."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "But I think that the thing that's most profound about LLVM is that through standardization, it made things possible that otherwise wouldn't have happened, okay?"}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And so interesting things that have happened with LLVM, for example, Sony has picked up LLVM and used it to do all the graphics compilation in their movie production pipeline."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And so now they're able to have better special effects because of LLVM."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "That's kind of cool."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "That's not what it was designed for, right?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "But that's the sign of good infrastructure when it can be used in ways it was never designed for because it has good layering and software engineering and it's composable and things like that."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "Which is where, as you said, it differs from GCC."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Yes, GCC is also great in various ways, but it's not as good as infrastructure technology."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "It's really a C compiler, or it's a Fortran compiler."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "It's not infrastructure in the same way."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Now you can tell I don't know what I'm talking about because I keep saying C lang."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "You can always tell when a person has clues, by the way, to pronounce something."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "I don't think, have I ever used C lang?"}, {"time": 1912, "text": "Entirely possible, have you?"}, {"time": 1914, "text": "Well, so you've used code, it's generated probably."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So C lang and LLVM are used to compile all the apps on the iPhone effectively and the OSs."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "It compiles Google's production server applications."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "It's used to build GameCube games and PlayStation 4 and things like that."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So as a user, I have, but just everything I've done that I experienced with Linux has been, I believe, always GCC."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Yeah, I think Linux still defaults to GCC."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "And is there a reason for that?"}, {"time": 1947, "text": "Or is it because, I mean, is there a reason for that?"}, {"time": 1949, "text": "It's a combination of technical and social reasons."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "Many Linux developers do use C lang, but the distributions, for lots of reasons, use GCC historically, and they've not switched, yeah."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "Because it's just anecdotally online, it seems that LLVM has either reached the level of GCC or superseded on different features or whatever."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "The way I would say it is that they're so close, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "Like, they're slightly better in some ways, slightly worse than otherwise, but it doesn't actually really matter anymore, that level."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So in terms of optimization breakthroughs, it's just been solid incremental work."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "Yeah, yeah, which describes a lot of compilers."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "The hard thing about compilers, in my experience, is the engineering, the software engineering, making it so that you can have hundreds of people collaborating on really detailed, low level work and scaling that."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "And that's really hard."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "And that's one of the things I think LLVM has done well."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And that kind of goes back to the original design goals with it to be modular and things like that."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And incidentally, I don't want to take all the credit for this, right?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "I mean, some of the best parts about LLVM is that it was designed to be modular."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "And when I started, I would write, for example, a register allocator, and then somebody much smarter than me would come in and pull it out and replace it with something else that they would come up with."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And because it's modular, they were able to do that."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And that's one of the challenges with GCC, for example, is replacing subsystems is incredibly difficult."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "It can be done, but it wasn't designed for that."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And that's one of the reasons that LLVM's been very successful in the research world as well."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "But in a community sense, Guido van Rossum, right, from Python, just retired from, what is it?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "Benevolent Dictator for Life, right?"}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So in managing this community of brilliant compiler folks, is there, did it, for a time at least, fall on you to approve things?"}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Oh yeah, so I mean, I still have something like an order of magnitude more patches in LLVM than anybody else, and many of those I wrote myself."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "But you still write, I mean, you're still close to the, to the, I don't know what the expression is, to the metal, you still write code."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "Yeah, I still write code."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "Not as much as I was able to in grad school, but that's an important part of my identity."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "But the way that LLVM has worked over time is that when I was a grad student, I could do all the work and steer everything and review every patch and make sure everything was done exactly the way my opinionated sense felt like it should be done, and that was fine."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "But as things scale, you can't do that, right?"}, {"time": 2114, "text": "And so what ends up happening is LLVM has a hierarchical system of what's called code owners."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "These code owners are given the responsibility not to do all the work, not necessarily to review all the patches, but to make sure that the patches do get reviewed and make sure that the right thing's happening architecturally in their area."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "And so what you'll see is you'll see that, for example, hardware manufacturers end up owning the hardware specific parts of their hardware."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "That's very common."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "Leaders in the community that have done really good work naturally become the de facto owner of something."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "And then usually somebody else is like, how about we make them the official code owner?"}, {"time": 2155, "text": "And then we'll have somebody to make sure that all the patches get reviewed in a timely manner."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And then everybody's like, yes, that's obvious."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And then it happens, right?"}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And usually this is a very organic thing, which is great."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "And so I'm nominally the top of that stack still, but I don't spend a lot of time reviewing patches."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "What I do is I help negotiate a lot of the technical disagreements that end up happening and making sure that the community as a whole makes progress and is moving in the right direction and doing that."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "So we also started a nonprofit six years ago, seven years ago, time's gone away."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And the LLVM Foundation nonprofit helps oversee all the business sides of things and make sure that the events that the LLVM community has are funded and set up and run correctly and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "But the foundation is very much stays out of the technical side of where the project is going."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "Right, so it sounds like a lot of it is just organic."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "Yeah, well, LLVM is almost 20 years old, which is hard to believe."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "Somebody pointed out to me recently that LLVM is now older than GCC was when LLVM started, right?"}, {"time": 2224, "text": "So time has a way of getting away from you."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "But the good thing about that is it has a really robust, really amazing community of people that are in their professional lives, spread across lots of different companies, but it's a community of people that are interested in similar kinds of problems and have been working together effectively for years and have a lot of trust and respect for each other."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And even if they don't always agree that we're able to find a path forward."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So then in a slightly different flavor of effort, you started at Apple in 2005 with the task of making, I guess, LLVM production ready."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And then eventually 2013 through 2017, leading the entire developer tools department."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "We're talking about LLVM, Xcode, Objective C to Swift."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "So in a quick overview of your time there, what were the challenges?"}, {"time": 2279, "text": "First of all, leading such a huge group of developers, what was the big motivator, dream, mission behind creating Swift, the early birth of it from Objective C and so on, and Xcode, what are some challenges?"}, {"time": 2294, "text": "So these are different questions."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "Yeah, I know, but I wanna talk about the other stuff too."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "I'll stay on the technical side, then we can talk about the big team pieces, if that's okay."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So it's to really oversimplify many years of hard work."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "LLVM started, joined Apple, became a thing, became successful and became deployed."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "But then there's a question about how do we actually parse the source code?"}, {"time": 2318, "text": "So LLVM is that back part, the optimizer and the code generator."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And LLVM was really good for Apple as it went through a couple of harder transitions."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "I joined right at the time of the Intel transition, for example, and 64 bit transitions, and then the transition to ARM with the iPhone."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "And so LLVM was very useful for some of these kinds of things."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "But at the same time, there's a lot of questions around developer experience."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And so if you're a programmer pounding out at the time Objective C code, the error message you get, the compile time, the turnaround cycle, the tooling and the IDE, were not great, were not as good as they could be."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "And so, as I occasionally do, I'm like, well, okay, how hard is it to write a C compiler?"}, {"time": 2360, "text": "And so I'm not gonna commit to anybody, I'm not gonna tell anybody, I'm just gonna just do it nights and weekends and start working on it."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And then I built up in C, there's this thing called the preprocessor, which people don't like, but it's actually really hard and complicated and includes a bunch of really weird things like trigraphs and other stuff like that that are really nasty, and it's the crux of a bunch of the performance issues in the compiler."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "Started working on the parser and kind of got to the point where I'm like, ah, you know what, we could actually do this."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Everybody's saying that this is impossible to do, but it's actually just hard, it's not impossible."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "And eventually told my manager about it, and he's like, oh, wow, this is great, we do need to solve this problem."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "Oh, this is great, we can get you one other person to work with you on this, you know?"}, {"time": 2404, "text": "And slowly a team is formed and it starts taking off."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "And C++, for example, huge, complicated language."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "People always assume that it's impossible to implement and it's very nearly impossible, but it's just really, really hard."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "And the way to get there is to build it one piece at a time incrementally."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And that was only possible because we were lucky to hire some really exceptional engineers that knew various parts of it very well and could do great things."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Swift was kind of a similar thing."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So Swift came from, we were just finishing off the first version of C++ support in Clang."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And C++ is a very formidable and very important language, but it's also ugly in lots of ways."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "And you can't influence C++ without thinking there has to be a better thing, right?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And so I started working on Swift, again, with no hope or ambition that would go anywhere, just let's see what could be done, let's play around with this thing."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "It was me in my spare time, not telling anybody about it, kind of a thing, and it made some good progress."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "I'm like, actually, it would make sense to do this."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "At the same time, I started talking with the senior VP of software at the time, a guy named Bertrand Serlet."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "And Bertrand was very encouraging."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "He was like, well, let's have fun, let's talk about this."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "And he was a little bit of a language guy, and so he helped guide some of the early work and encouraged me and got things off the ground."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And eventually told my manager and told other people, and it started making progress."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "The complicating thing with Swift was that the idea of doing a new language was not obvious to anybody, including myself."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "And the tone at the time was that the iPhone was successful because of Objective C. Oh, interesting."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Not despite of or just because of."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And you have to understand that at the time, Apple was hiring software people that loved Objective C. And it wasn't that they came despite Objective C. They loved Objective C, and that's why they got hired."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And so you had a software team that the leadership, in many cases, went all the way back to Next, where Objective C really became real."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And so they, quote unquote, grew up writing Objective C. And many of the individual engineers all were hired because they loved Objective C. And so this notion of, OK, let's do new language was kind of heretical in many ways."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "Meanwhile, my sense was that the outside community wasn't really in love with Objective C. Some people were, and some of the most outspoken people were."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "But other people were hitting challenges because it has very sharp corners and it's difficult to learn."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And so one of the challenges of making Swift happen that was totally non technical is the social part of what do we do?"}, {"time": 2577, "text": "If we do a new language, which at Apple, many things happen that don't ship."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So if we ship it, what is the metrics of success?"}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Why would we do this?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Why wouldn't we make Objective C better?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "If Objective C has problems, let's file off those rough corners and edges."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "And one of the major things that became the reason to do this was this notion of safety, memory safety."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And the way Objective C works is that a lot of the object system and everything else is built on top of pointers in C. Objective C is an extension on top of C. And so pointers are unsafe."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "And if you get rid of the pointers, it's not Objective C anymore."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And so fundamentally, that was an issue that you could not fix safety or memory safety without fundamentally changing the language."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And so once we got through that part of the mental process and the thought process, it became a design process of saying, OK, well, if we're going to do something new, what is good?"}, {"time": 2636, "text": "How do we think about this?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "And what do we like?"}, {"time": 2638, "text": "And what are we looking for?"}, {"time": 2640, "text": "And that was a very different phase of it."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So what are some design choices early on in Swift?"}, {"time": 2645, "text": "Like we're talking about braces, are you making a typed language or not, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Yeah, so some of those were obvious given the context."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So a typed language, for example, Objective C is a typed language."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "And going with an untyped language wasn't really seriously considered."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "We wanted the performance, and we wanted refactoring tools and other things like that that go with typed languages."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Quick, dumb question."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Was it obvious, I think this would be a dumb question, but was it obvious that the language has to be a compiled language?"}, {"time": 2680, "text": "Yes, that's not a dumb question."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "Earlier, I think late 90s, Apple had seriously considered moving its development experience to Java."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "But Swift started in 2010, which was several years after the iPhone."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "It was when the iPhone was definitely on an upward trajectory."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "And the iPhone was still extremely, and is still a bit memory constrained."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And so being able to compile the code and then ship it and then having standalone code that is not JIT compiled is a very big deal and is very much part of the Apple value system."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Now, JavaScript's also a thing."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "I mean, it's not that this is exclusive, and technologies are good depending on how they're applied."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "But in the design of Swift, saying, how can we make Objective C better?"}, {"time": 2728, "text": "Objective C is statically compiled, and that was the contiguous, natural thing to do."}, {"time": 2732, "text": "Just skip ahead a little bit, and we'll go right back."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "Just as a question, as you think about today in 2019 in your work at Google, TensorFlow and so on, is, again, compilations, static compilation still the right thing?"}, {"time": 2749, "text": "Yeah, so the funny thing after working on compilers for a really long time is that, and this is one of the things that LLVM has helped with, is that I don't look at compilations being static or dynamic or interpreted or not."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "This is a spectrum."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And one of the cool things about Swift is that Swift is not just statically compiled."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "It's actually dynamically compiled as well, and it can also be interpreted."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "Though, nobody's actually done that."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And so what ends up happening when you use Swift in a workbook, for example in Colab or in Jupyter, is it's actually dynamically compiling the statements as you execute them."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "And so this gets back to the software engineering problems, where if you layer the stack properly, you can actually completely change how and when things get compiled because you have the right abstractions there."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And so the way that a Colab workbook works with Swift is that when you start typing into it, it creates a process, a Unix process."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "And then each line of code you type in, it compiles it through the Swift compiler, the front end part, and then sends it through the optimizer, JIT compiles machine code, and then injects it into that process."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And so as you're typing new stuff, it's like squirting in new code and overwriting and replacing and updating code in place."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "And the fact that it can do this is not an accident."}, {"time": 2833, "text": "Swift was designed for this."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "But it's an important part of how the language was set up and how it's layered, and this is a nonobvious piece."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "And one of the things with Swift that was, for me, a very strong design point is to make it so that you can learn it very quickly."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And so from a language design perspective, the thing that I always come back to is this UI principle of progressive disclosure of complexity."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And so in Swift, you can start by saying print, quote, hello world, quote."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And there's no slash n, just like Python, one line of code, no main, no header files, no public static class void, blah, blah, blah, string like Java has, one line of code."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And you can teach that, and it works great."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "Then you can say, well, let's introduce variables."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And so you can declare a variable with var."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "So var x equals 4."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "What is a variable?"}, {"time": 2884, "text": "You can use x, x plus 1."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "This is what it means."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "Then you can say, well, how about control flow?"}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Well, this is what an if statement is."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "This is what a for statement is."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "This is what a while statement is."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Then you can say, let's introduce functions."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And many languages like Python have had this kind of notion of let's introduce small things, and then you can add complexity."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Then you can introduce classes."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And then you can add generics, in the case of Swift."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "And then you can build in modules and build out in terms of the things that you're expressing."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "But this is not very typical for compiled languages."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And so this was a very strong design point, and one of the reasons that Swift, in general, is designed with this factoring of complexity in mind so that the language can express powerful things."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "You can write firmware in Swift if you want to."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "But it has a very high level feel, which is really this perfect blend, because often you have very advanced library writers that want to be able to use the nitty gritty details."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "But then other people just want to use the libraries and work at a higher abstraction level."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "It's kind of cool that I saw that you can just interoperability."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "I don't think I pronounced that word enough."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "But you can just drag in Python."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "It's just strange."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "You can import, like I saw this in the demo."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "How do you make that happen?"}, {"time": 2961, "text": "What's up with that?"}, {"time": 2963, "text": "Is that as easy as it looks, or is it?"}, {"time": 2965, "text": "Yes, as easy as it looks."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "That's not a stage magic hack or anything like that."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "I don't mean from the user perspective."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "I mean from the implementation perspective to make it happen."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "So it's easy once all the pieces are in place."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "The way it works, so if you think about a dynamically typed language like Python, you can think about it in two different ways."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "You can say it has no types, which is what most people would say."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Or you can say it has one type."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And you can say it has one type, and it's the Python object."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "And the Python object gets passed around."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And because there's only one type, it's implicit."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "And so what happens with Swift and Python talking to each other, Swift has lots of types."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "It has arrays, and it has strings, and all classes, and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "But it now has a Python object type."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So there is one Python object type."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And so when you say import NumPy, what you get is a Python object, which is the NumPy module."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "And then you say np.array."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "It says, OK, hey, Python object, I have no idea what you are."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Give me your array member."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "OK, cool."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "And it just uses dynamic stuff, talks to the Python interpreter, and says, hey, Python, what's the.array member in that Python object?"}, {"time": 3035, "text": "It gives you back another Python object."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "And now you say parentheses for the call and the arguments you're going to pass."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "And so then it says, hey, a Python object that is the result of np.array, call with these arguments."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "Again, calling into the Python interpreter to do that work."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "And so right now, this is all really simple."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "And if you dive into the code, what you'll see is that the Python module in Swift is something like 1,200 lines of code or something."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "It's written in pure Swift."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "It's super simple."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "And it's built on top of the C interoperability because it just talks to the Python interpreter."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "But making that possible required us to add two major language features to Swift to be able to express these dynamic calls and the dynamic member lookups."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "And so what we've done over the last year is we've proposed, implement, standardized, and contributed new language features to the Swift language in order to make it so it is really trivial."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And this is one of the things about Swift that is critical to the Swift for TensorFlow work, which is that we can actually add new language features."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And the bar for adding those is high, but it's what makes it possible."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "So you're now at Google doing incredible work on several things, including TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So TensorFlow 2.0 or whatever leading up to 2.0 has, by default, in 2.0, has eager execution."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "And yet, in order to make code optimized for GPU or TPU or some of these systems, computation needs to be converted to a graph."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "So what's that process like?"}, {"time": 3127, "text": "What are the challenges there?"}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Yeah, so I am tangentially involved in this."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "But the way that it works with Autograph is that you mark your function with a decorator."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "And when Python calls it, that decorator is invoked."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And then it says, before I call this function, you can transform it."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "And so the way Autograph works is, as far as I understand, is it actually uses the Python parser to go parse that, turn it into a syntax tree, and now apply compiler techniques to, again, transform this down into TensorFlow graphs."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "And so you can think of it as saying, hey, I have an if statement."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "I'm going to create an if node in the graph, like you say tf.cond."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "You have a multiply."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "Well, I'll turn that into a multiply node in the graph."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "And it becomes this tree transformation."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So where does the Swift for TensorFlow come in, which is parallels?"}, {"time": 3184, "text": "For one, Swift is an interface."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Like, Python is an interface to TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "But it seems like there's a lot more going on in just a different language interface."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "There's optimization methodology."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So the TensorFlow world has a couple of different what I'd call front end technologies."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "And so Swift and Python and Go and Rust and Julia and all these things share the TensorFlow graphs and all the runtime and everything that's later."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "And so Swift for TensorFlow is merely another front end for TensorFlow, just like any of these other systems are."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "There's a major difference between, I would say, three camps of technologies here."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "There's Python, which is a special case, because the vast majority of the community effort is going to the Python interface."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And Python has its own approaches for automatic differentiation."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "It has its own APIs and all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "There's Swift, which I'll talk about in a second."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "And then there's kind of everything else."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And so the everything else are effectively language bindings."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "So they call into the TensorFlow runtime, but they usually don't have automatic differentiation or they usually don't provide anything other than APIs that call the C APIs in TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "And so they're kind of wrappers for that."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "Swift is really kind of special."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And it's a very different approach."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "Swift for TensorFlow, that is, is a very different approach."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "Because there we're saying, let's look at all the problems that need to be solved in the full stack of the TensorFlow compilation process, if you think about it that way."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "Because TensorFlow is fundamentally a compiler."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "It takes models, and then it makes them go fast on hardware."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "That's what a compiler does."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And it has a front end, it has an optimizer, and it has many back ends."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "And so if you think about it the right way, or if you look at it in a particular way, it is a compiler."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "And so Swift is merely another front end."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "But it's saying, and the design principle is saying, let's look at all the problems that we face as machine learning practitioners and what is the best possible way we can do that, given the fact that we can change literally anything in this entire stack."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And Python, for example, where the vast majority of the engineering and effort has gone into, is constrained by being the best possible thing you can do with a Python library."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "There are no Python language features that are added because of machine learning that I'm aware of."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "They added a matrix multiplication operator with that, but that's as close as you get."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And so with Swift, it's hard, but you can add language features to the language."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "And there's a community process for that."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And so we look at these things and say, well, what is the right division of labor between the human programmer and the compiler?"}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And Swift has a number of things that shift that balance."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "So because it has a type system, for example, that makes certain things possible for analysis of the code, and the compiler can automatically build graphs for you without you thinking about them."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "That's a big deal for a programmer."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "You just get free performance."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "You get clustering and fusion and optimization, things like that, without you as a programmer having to manually do it because the compiler can do it for you."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Automatic differentiation is another big deal."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "And I think one of the key contributions of the Swift TensorFlow project is that there's this entire body of work on automatic differentiation that dates back to the Fortran days."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "People doing a tremendous amount of numerical computing in Fortran used to write these what they call source to source translators, where you take a bunch of code, shove it into a mini compiler, and it would push out more Fortran code."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "But it would generate the backwards passes for your functions for you, the derivatives."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And so in that work in the 70s, a tremendous number of optimizations, a tremendous number of techniques for fixing numerical instability, and other kinds of problems were developed."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "But they're very difficult to port into a world where, in eager execution, you get an op by op at a time."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "You need to be able to look at an entire function and be able to reason about what's going on."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And so when you have a language integrated automatic differentiation, which is one of the things that the Swift project is focusing on, you can open all these techniques and reuse them in familiar ways."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "But the language integration piece has a bunch of design room in it, and it's also complicated."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "The other piece of the puzzle here that's kind of interesting is TPUs at Google."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "So we're in a new world with deep learning."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "It constantly is changing, and I imagine, without disclosing anything, I imagine you're still innovating on the TPU front, too."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So how much interplay is there between software and hardware in trying to figure out how to together move towards an optimized solution?"}, {"time": 3476, "text": "There's an incredible amount."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "So we're on our third generation of TPUs, which are now 100 petaflops in a very large liquid cooled box, virtual box with no cover."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "And as you might imagine, we're not out of ideas yet."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "The great thing about TPUs is that they're a perfect example of hardware software co design."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And so it's about saying, what hardware do we build to solve certain classes of machine learning problems?"}, {"time": 3503, "text": "Well, the algorithms are changing."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "The hardware takes some cases years to produce."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "And so you have to make bets and decide what is going to happen and what is the best way to spend the transistors to get the maximum performance per watt or area per cost or whatever it is that you're optimizing for."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "And so one of the amazing things about TPUs is this numeric format called bfloat16."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "bfloat16 is a compressed 16 bit floating point format, but it puts the bits in different places."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "And in numeric terms, it has a smaller mantissa and a larger exponent."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "That means that it's less precise, but it can represent larger ranges of values, which in the machine learning context is really important and useful because sometimes you have very small gradients you want to accumulate and very, very small numbers that are important to move things as you're learning."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "But sometimes you have very large magnitude numbers as well."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "And bfloat16 is not as precise."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "The mantissa is small."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "But it turns out the machine learning algorithms actually want to generalize."}, {"time": 3571, "text": "And so there's theories that this actually increases the ability for the network to generalize across data sets."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "And regardless of whether it's good or bad, it's much cheaper at the hardware level to implement because the area and time of a multiplier is n squared in the number of bits in the mantissa, but it's linear with size of the exponent."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "And you're connected to both efforts here both on the hardware and the software side?"}, {"time": 3597, "text": "Yeah, and so that was a breakthrough coming from the research side and people working on optimizing network transport of weights across the network originally and trying to find ways to compress that."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "But then it got burned into silicon."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "And it's a key part of what makes TPU performance so amazing and great."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "Now, TPUs have many different aspects that are important."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "But the co design between the low level compiler bits and the software bits and the algorithms is all super important."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "And it's this amazing trifecta that only Google can do."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "Yeah, that's super exciting."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "So can you tell me about MLIR project, previously the secretive one?"}, {"time": 3641, "text": "Yeah, so MLIR is a project that we announced at a compiler conference three weeks ago or something at the Compilers for Machine Learning conference."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "Basically, again, if you look at TensorFlow as a compiler stack, it has a number of compiler algorithms within it."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "It also has a number of compilers that get embedded into it."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "And they're made by different vendors."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "For example, Google has XLA, which is a great compiler system."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "NVIDIA has TensorRT."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "Intel has NGRAPH."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "There's a number of these different compiler systems."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And they're very hardware specific."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "And they're trying to solve different parts of the problems."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "But they're all kind of similar in a sense of they want to integrate with TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "Now, TensorFlow has an optimizer."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "And it has these different code generation technologies built in."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "The idea of MLIR is to build a common infrastructure to support all these different subsystems."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "And initially, it's to be able to make it so that they all plug in together and they can share a lot more code and can be reusable."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "But over time, we hope that the industry will start collaborating and sharing code."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And instead of reinventing the same things over and over again, that we can actually foster some of that working together to solve common problem energy that has been useful in the compiler field before."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Beyond that, MLIR is some people have joked that it's kind of LLVM too."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "It learns a lot about what LLVM has been good and what LLVM has done wrong."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "And it's a chance to fix that."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "And also, there are challenges in the LLVM ecosystem as well, where LLVM is very good at the thing it was designed to do."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "But 20 years later, the world has changed."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And people are trying to solve higher level problems."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "And we need some new technology."}, {"time": 3740, "text": "And what's the future of open source in this context?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "Very soon."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "So it is not yet open source."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "But it will be hopefully in the next couple months."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "So you still believe in the value of open source in these kinds of contexts?"}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And I think that the TensorFlow community at large fully believes in open source."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "So I mean, there is a difference between Apple, where you were previously, and Google now, in spirit and culture."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "And I would say the open source in TensorFlow was a seminal moment in the history of software, because here's this large company releasing a very large code base that's open sourcing."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "What are your thoughts on that?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Happy or not, were you to see that kind of degree of open sourcing?"}, {"time": 3782, "text": "So between the two, I prefer the Google approach, if that's what you're saying."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "The Apple approach makes sense, given the historical context that Apple came from."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "But that's been 35 years ago."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And I think that Apple is definitely adapting."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And the way I look at it is that there's different kinds of concerns in the space."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "It is very rational for a business to care about making money."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "That fundamentally is what a business is about."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "But I think it's also incredibly realistic to say, it's not your string library that's the thing that's going to make you money."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "It's going to be the amazing UI product differentiating features and other things like that that you built on top of your string library."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "And so keeping your string library proprietary and secret and things like that is maybe not the important thing anymore."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "Where before, platforms were different."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And even 15 years ago, things were a little bit different."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "But the world is changing."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "So Google strikes a very good balance, I think."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "And I think that TensorFlow being open source really changed the entire machine learning field and caused a revolution in its own right."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "And so I think it's amazingly forward looking because I could have imagined, and I wasn't at Google at the time, but I could imagine a different context and different world where a company says, machine learning is critical to what we're doing."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "We're not going to give it to other people."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And so that decision is a profoundly brilliant insight that I think has really led to the world being better and better for Google as well."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And has all kinds of ripple effects."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "I think it is really, I mean, you can't understate Google deciding how profound that is for software."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "Well, and again, I can understand the concern about if we release our machine learning software, our competitors could go faster."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "But on the other hand, I think that open sourcing TensorFlow has been fantastic for Google."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "And I'm sure that decision was very nonobvious at the time, but I think it's worked out very well."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "So let's try this real quick."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "You were at Tesla for five months as the VP of autopilot software."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "You led the team during the transition from H hardware one to hardware two."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "I have a couple of questions."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "So one, first of all, to me, that's one of the bravest engineering decisions undertaking really ever in the automotive industry to me, software wise, starting from scratch."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "It's a really brave engineering decision."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So my one question there is, what was that like?"}, {"time": 3942, "text": "What was the challenge of that?"}, {"time": 3943, "text": "Do you mean the career decision of jumping from a comfortable good job into the unknown, or?"}, {"time": 3948, "text": "That combined, so at the individual level, you making that decision."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "And then when you show up, it's a really hard engineering problem."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "So you could just stay, maybe slow down, say hardware one, or those kinds of decisions."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "Just taking it full on, let's do this from scratch."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "What was that like?"}, {"time": 3971, "text": "Well, so I mean, I don't think Tesla has a culture of taking things slow and seeing how it goes."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And one of the things that attracted me about Tesla is it's very

an agent's ability to perform well in a wide range of environments."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "So that doesn't sound very impressive."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And these words have been very carefully chosen and there is a mathematical theory behind that and we come back to that later."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And if you look at this definition by itself, it seems like, yeah, okay, but it seems a lot of things are missing."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But if you think it through, then you realize that most, and I claim all of the other traits, at least of rational intelligence, which we usually associate with intelligence, are emergent phenomena from this definition."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Like creativity, memorization, planning, knowledge."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "You all need that in order to perform well in a wide range of environments."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So you don't have to explicitly mention that in a definition."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So yeah, so the consciousness, abstract reasoning, all these kinds of things are just emergent phenomena that help you in towards, can you say the definition again?"}, {"time": 1661, "text": "So multiple environments."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "Did you mention the word goals?"}, {"time": 1665, "text": "No, but we have an alternative definition."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "Instead of performing well, you can just replace it by goals."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "That's more or less equal."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "But interesting, because in there, there's an injection of the word goals."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So we want to specify there should be a goal."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Yeah, but perform well is sort of, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "There's a little bit gray area, but it's much closer to something that could be formalized."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "In your view, are humans, where do humans fit into that definition?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Are they general intelligence systems that are able to perform in, like how good are they at fulfilling that definition at performing well in multiple environments?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Yeah, that's a big question."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "I mean, the humans are performing best among all species."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "We know of, yeah."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Depends."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "You could say that trees and plants are doing a better job."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "They'll probably outlast us."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Yeah, but they are in a much more narrow environment, right?"}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I mean, you just have a little bit of air pollutions and these trees die and we can adapt, right?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "We build houses, we build filters, we do geoengineering."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So the multiple environment part."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Yeah, that is very important, yeah."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So that distinguish narrow intelligence from wide intelligence, also in the AI research."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So let me ask the Allentourian question."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Can machines be intelligent?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So in your view, I have to kind of ask, the answer is probably yes, but I want to kind of hear what your thoughts on it."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "Can machines be made to fulfill this definition of intelligence, to achieve intelligence?"}, {"time": 1770, "text": "Well, we are sort of getting there and on a small scale, we are already there."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "The wide range of environments are missing, but we have self driving cars, we have programs which play Go and chess, we have speech recognition."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So that's pretty amazing, but these are narrow environments."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "But if you look at AlphaZero, that was also developed by DeepMind."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "I mean, got famous with AlphaGo and then came AlphaZero a year later."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "That was truly amazing."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "So reinforcement learning algorithm, which is able just by self play, to play chess and then also Go."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And I mean, yes, they're both games, but they're quite different games."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "And you didn't don't feed them the rules of the game."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And the most remarkable thing, which is still a mystery to me, that usually for any decent chess program, I don't know much about Go, you need opening books and end game tables and so on too."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And nothing in there, nothing was put in there."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Especially with AlphaZero, the self playing mechanism starting from scratch, being able to learn actually new strategies is... Yeah, it rediscovered all these famous openings within four hours by itself."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "What I was really happy about, I'm a terrible chess player, but I like Queen Gumby."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "And AlphaZero figured out that this is the best opening."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "Finally, somebody proved you correct."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "So yes, to answer your question, yes, I believe that general intelligence is possible."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And it also, I mean, it depends how you define it."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Do you say AGI with general intelligence, artificial intelligence, only refers to if you achieve human level or a subhuman level, but quite broad, is it also general intelligence?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "So we have to distinguish, or it's only super human intelligence, general artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Is there a test in your mind, like the Turing test for natural language or some other test that would impress the heck out of you that would kind of cross the line of your sense of intelligence within the framework that you said?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Well, the Turing test has been criticized a lot, but I think it's not as bad as some people think."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And some people think it's too strong."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So it tests not just for system to be intelligent, but it also has to fake human deception, which is much harder."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And on the other hand, they say it's too weak because it just maybe fakes emotions or intelligent behavior."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "It's not real."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "But I don't think that's the problem or a big problem."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So if you would pass the Turing test, so a conversation over terminal with a bot for an hour, or maybe a day or so, and you can fool a human into not knowing whether this is a human or not, so that's the Turing test, I would be truly impressed."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "And I mean, it started with ELISA, that was the first conversational program."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And what is it called?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "The Japanese Mitsuko or so."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "That's the winner of the last couple of years."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "And well."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Quite impressive."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Yeah, it's quite impressive."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And then Google has developed Mina, right?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Just recently, that's an open domain conversational bot, just a couple of weeks ago, I think."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "Yeah, I kind of like the metric that sort of the Alexa Prize has proposed."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "I mean, maybe it's obvious to you."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "It wasn't to me of setting sort of a length of a conversation."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "Like you want the bot to be sufficiently interesting that you would want to keep talking to it for like 20 minutes."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "And that's a surprisingly effective in aggregate metric, because really, like nobody has the patience to be able to talk to a bot that's not interesting and intelligent and witty, and is able to go on to different tangents, jump domains, be able to say something interesting to maintain your attention."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "And maybe many humans will also fail this test."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "That's the, unfortunately, we set, just like with autonomous vehicles, with chatbots, we also set a bar that's way too high to reach."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "I said, you know, the Turing test is not as bad as some people believe, but what is really not useful about the Turing test, it gives us no guidance how to develop these systems in the first place."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "Of course, you know, we can develop them by trial and error and, you know, do whatever and then run the test and see whether it works or not."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "But a mathematical definition of intelligence gives us, you know, an objective, which we can then analyze by theoretical tools or computational, and, you know, maybe even prove how close we are."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And we will come back to that later with the iXe model."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So, I mentioned the compression, right?"}, {"time": 2071, "text": "So in natural language processing, they have achieved amazing results."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "And one way to test this, of course, you know, take the system, you train it, and then you see how well it performs on the task."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "But a lot of performance measurement is done by so called perplexity, which is essentially the same as complexity or compression length."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "So the NLP community develops new systems and then they measure the compression length and then they have ranking and leaks because there's a strong correlation between compressing well, and then the system's performing well at the task at hand."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "It's not perfect, but it's good enough for them as an intermediate aim."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So you mean a measure, so this is kind of almost returning to the common goal of complexity."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "So you're saying good compression usually means good intelligence."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "So you mentioned you're one of the only people who dared boldly to try to formalize the idea of artificial general intelligence, to have a mathematical

We don't have to put them now."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Scratch it, scratch it, dumb question, okay."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "So the simplest form of prediction is that you just have data which you passively observe, and you want to predict what happens without interfering, as I said, weather forecasting, stock market, IQ sequences, or just anything, okay?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "Of course, if there's a prediction task, or a task which is unpredictable, like, you know, you have fair coin flips."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Yeah, I cannot predict the next fair coin flip."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "What Solomonov does is says, okay, next head is probably 50%."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "It's the best you can do."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "So if something is unpredictable, Solomonov will also not magically predict it."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "But if there is some pattern and predictability, then Solomonov induction will figure that out eventually, and not just eventually, but rather quickly, and you can have proof convergence rates, whatever your data is."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So there's pure magic in a sense."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "What's the catch?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "Well, the catch is that it's not computable, and we come back to that later."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "You cannot just implement it even with Google resources here, and run it and predict the stock market and become rich."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "I mean, Ray Solomonov already tried it at the time."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "But so the basic task is you're in the environment, and you're interacting with the environment to try to learn to model that environment, and the model is in the space of all these programs, and your goal is to get a bunch of programs that are simple."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "Yeah, so let's go to the actions now."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "But actually, good that you asked."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "Usually I skip this part, although there is also a minor contribution which I did, so the action part, but I usually sort of just jump to the decision part."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "So let me explain the action part now."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "Thanks for asking."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So you have to modify it a little bit by now not just predicting a sequence which just comes to you, but you have an observation, then you act somehow, and then you want to predict the next observation based on the past observation and your action."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Then you take the next action."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "You don't care about predicting it because you're doing it."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Then you get the next observation, and you want, well, before you get it, you want to predict it, again, based on your past action and observation sequence."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "You just condition extra on your actions."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "There's an interesting alternative that you also try to predict your own actions."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "If you want."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "In the past or the future?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "In your future actions."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "Wait, let me wrap."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "I think my brain just broke."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "We should maybe discuss that later after I've explained the IXE model."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "That's an interesting variation."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "But that is a really interesting variation, and a quick comment."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "I don't know if you want to insert that in here, but you're looking at the, in terms of observations, you're looking at the entire, the big history, the long history of the observations."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "That's very important."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "The whole history from birth sort of of the agent, and we can come back to that."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And also why this is important."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "Often, you know, in RL, you have MDPs, micro decision processes, which are much more limiting."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "So now we can predict conditioned on actions."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So even if you influence environment, but prediction is not all we want to do, right?"}, {"time": 2604, "text": "We also want to act really in the world."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And the question is how to choose the actions."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And we don't want to greedily choose the actions, you know, just, you know, what is best in the next time step."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And we first, I should say, you know, what is, you know, how do we measure performance?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So we measure performance by giving the agent reward."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "That's the so called reinforcement learning framework."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So every time step, you can give it a positive reward or negative reward, or maybe no reward."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "It could be a very scarce, right?"}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Like if you play chess, just at the end of the game, you give plus one for winning or minus one for losing."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "So in the RxC framework, that's completely sufficient."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "So occasionally you give a reward signal and you ask the agent to maximize reward, but not greedily sort of, you know, the next one, next one, because that's very bad in the long run if you're greedy."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So, but over the lifetime of the agent."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So let's assume the agent lives for M time steps, or say dies in sort of a hundred years sharp."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "That's just, you know, the simplest model to explain."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "So it looks at the future reward sum and ask what is my action sequence, or actually more precisely my policy, which leads in expectation, because I don't know the world, to the maximum reward sum."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Let me give you an analogy."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "In chess, for instance, we know how to play optimally in theory."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "It's just a mini max strategy."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "I play the move which seems best to me under the assumption that the opponent plays the move which is best for him."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So best, so worst for me under the assumption that he, I play again, the best move."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And then you have this expecting max three to the end of the game, and then you back propagate, and then you get the best possible move."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "So that is the optimal strategy, which von Neumann already figured out a long time ago, for playing adversarial games."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Luckily, or maybe unluckily for the theory, it becomes harder."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "The world is not always adversarial."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "So it can be, if there are other humans, even cooperative, or nature is usually, I mean, the dead nature is stochastic, you know, things just happen randomly, or don't care about you."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "So what you have to take into account is the noise, and not necessarily adversarialty."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "So you replace the minimum on the opponent's side by an expectation, which is general enough to include also adversarial cases."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "So now instead of a mini max strategy, you have an expected max strategy."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "So far, so good."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "So that is well known."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "It's called sequential decision theory."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "But the question is, on which probability distribution do you base that?"}, {"time": 2752, "text": "If I have the true probability distribution, like say I play backgammon, right?"}, {"time": 2756, "text": "There's dice, and there's certain randomness involved."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "Yeah, I can calculate probabilities and feed it in the expected max, or the sequential decision tree, come up with the optimal decision if I have enough compute."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "But for the real world, we don't know that, you know, what is the probability the driver in front of me breaks?"}, {"time": 2774, "text": "So depends on all kinds of things, and especially new situations, I don't know."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "So this is this unknown thing about prediction, and there's where Solomonov comes in."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So what you do is in sequential decision tree, you just replace the true distribution, which we don't know, by this universal distribution."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "I didn't explicitly talk about it, but this is used for universal prediction and plug it into the sequential decision tree mechanism."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "And then you get the best of both worlds."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "You have a long term planning agent, but it doesn't need to know anything about the world because the Solomonov induction part learns."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "Can you explicitly try to describe the universal distribution and how Solomonov induction plays a role here?"}, {"time": 2819, "text": "I'm trying to understand."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "So what it does it, so in the simplest case, I said, take the shortest program, describing your data, run it, have a prediction which would be deterministic."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "But you should not just take the shortest program, but also consider the longer ones, but give it lower a priori probability."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "So in the Bayesian framework, you say a priori, any distribution, which is a model or a stochastic program, has a certain a priori probability, which is two to the minus, and why two to the minus length?"}, {"time": 2853, "text": "You know, I could explain length of this program."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So longer programs are punished a priori."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "And then you multiply it with the so called likelihood function, which is, as the name suggests, is how likely is this model given the data at hand."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So if you have a very wrong model, it's very unlikely that this model is true."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And so it is very small number."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So even if the model is simple, it gets penalized by that."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And what you do is then you take just the sum, or this is the average over it."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "And this gives you a probability distribution."}, {"time":

kind of a nice idea."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "So okay, and then you said there's you're playing N or M or forgot the letter steps into the future."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So how difficult is that problem?"}, {"time": 2908, "text": "What's involved there?"}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Okay, so basic optimization problem."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "What are we talking about?"}, {"time": 2912, "text": "Yeah, so you have a planning problem up to horizon M, and that's exponential time in the horizon M, which is, I mean, it's computable, but intractable."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I mean, even for chess, it's already intractable to do that exactly."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And you know, for goal."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "But it could be also discounted kind of framework where."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Yeah, so having a hard horizon, you know, at 100 years, it's just for simplicity of discussing the model and also sometimes the math is simple."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "But there are lots of variations, actually quite interesting parameter."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "There's nothing really problematic about it, but it's very interesting."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So for instance, you think, no, let's let the parameter M tend to infinity, right?"}, {"time": 2952, "text": "You want an agent which lives forever, right?"}, {"time": 2955, "text": "If you do it normally, you have two problems."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "First, the mathematics breaks down because you have an infinite reward sum, which may give infinity, and getting reward 0.1 every time step is infinity, and giving reward one every time step is infinity, so equally good."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "Not really what we want."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "Other problem is that if you have an infinite life, you can be lazy for as long as you want for 10 years and then catch up with the same expected reward."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And think about yourself or maybe some friends or so."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "If they knew they lived forever, why work hard now?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Just enjoy your life and then catch up later."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "So that's another problem with infinite horizon."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And you mentioned, yes, we can go to discounting, but then the standard discounting is so called geometric discounting."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "So a dollar today is about worth as much as $1.05 tomorrow."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So if you do the so called geometric discounting, you have introduced an effective horizon."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So the agent is now motivated to look ahead a certain amount of time effectively."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "It's like a moving horizon."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "And for any fixed effective horizon, there is a problem to solve, which requires larger horizon."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So if I look ahead five time steps, I'm a terrible chess player, right?"}, {"time": 3032, "text": "I'll need to look ahead longer."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "If I play go, I probably have to look ahead even longer."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So for every problem, for every horizon, there is a problem which this horizon cannot solve."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "But I introduced the so called near harmonic horizon, which goes down with one over T rather than exponential in T, which produces an agent, which effectively looks into the future proportional to each age."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "So if it's five years old, it plans for five years."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "If it's 100 years old, it then plans for 100 years."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And it's a little bit similar to humans too, right?"}, {"time": 3062, "text": "I mean, children don't plan ahead very long, but then we get adult, we play ahead more longer."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Maybe when we get very old, I mean, we know that we don't live forever."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "Maybe then our horizon shrinks again."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So adjusting the horizon, is there some mathematical benefit of that?"}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Or is it just a nice, I mean, intuitively, empirically, it would probably be a good idea to sort of push the horizon back, extend the horizon as you experience more of the world."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "But is there some mathematical conclusions here that are beneficial?"}, {"time": 3097, "text": "With solomonic reductions or the prediction part, we have extremely strong finite time, but not finite data results."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "So you have so and so much data, then you lose so and so much."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So it's a, the theory is really great."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "With the ICSE model, with the planning part, many results are only asymptotic, which, well, this is... What does asymptotic mean?"}, {"time": 3117, "text": "Asymptotic means you can prove, for instance, that in the long run, if the agent, you know, acts long enough, then, you know, it performs optimal or some nice thing happens."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "So, but you don't know how fast it converges."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "So it may converge fast, but we're just not able to prove it because of a difficult problem."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Or maybe there's a bug in the model so that it's really that slow."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So that is what asymptotic means, sort of eventually, but we don't know how fast."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And if I give the agent a fixed horizon M, then I cannot prove asymptotic results, right?"}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So I mean, sort of if it dies in a hundred years, then in a hundred years it's over, I cannot say eventually."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "So this is the advantage of the discounting that I can prove asymptotic results."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So just to clarify, so I, okay, I made, I've built up a model, we're now in the moment of, I have this way of looking several steps ahead."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "How do I pick what action I will take?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "It's like with the playing chess, right?"}, {"time": 3180, "text": "You do this minimax."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "In this case here, do expectimax based on the solomonov distribution, you propagate back, and then while an action falls out, the action which maximizes the future expected reward on the solomonov distribution, and then you just take this action."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And then repeat."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "And then you get a new observation, and you feed it in this action observation, then you repeat."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "And the reward, so on."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Yeah, so you rewrote too, yeah."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "And then maybe you can even predict your own action."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "I love that idea."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "But okay, this big framework, what is it, I mean, it's kind of a beautiful mathematical framework to think about artificial general intelligence."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "What can you, what does it help you into it about how to build such systems?"}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Or maybe from another perspective, what does it help us in understanding AGI?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "So when I started in the field, I was always interested in two things."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "One was AGI, the name didn't exist then, what's called general AI or strong AI, and the physics theory of everything."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So I switched back and forth between computer science and physics quite often."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "You said the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "The theory of everything, yeah."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Those are basically the two biggest problems before all of humanity."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Yeah, I can explain if you wanted some later time, why I'm interested in these two questions."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "Can I ask you in a small tangent, if it was one to be solved, which one would you, if an apple fell on your head and there was a brilliant insight and you could arrive at the solution to one, would it be AGI or the theory of everything?"}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Definitely AGI, because once the AGI problem is solved, I can ask the AGI to solve the other problem for me."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "Yeah, brilliant input."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Okay, so as you were saying about it."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Okay, so, and the reason why I didn't settle, I mean, this thought about, once you have solved AGI, it solves all kinds of other, not just the theory of every problem, but all kinds of more useful problems to humanity is very appealing to many people."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "And I had this thought also, but I was quite disappointed with the state of the art of the field of AI."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "There was some theory about logical reasoning, but I was never convinced that this will fly."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "And then there was this more heuristic approaches with neural networks and I didn't like these heuristics."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So, and also I didn't have any good idea myself."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "So that's the reason why I toggled back and forth quite some while and even worked four and a half years in a company developing software, something completely unrelated."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "But then I had this idea about the ICSE model."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And so what it gives you, it gives you a gold standard."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "So I have proven that this is the most intelligent agents which anybody could build in quotation mark, because it's just mathematical and you need infinite compute."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "But this is the limit and this is completely specified."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "It's not just a framework and every year, tens of frameworks are developed, which are just skeletons and then pieces are missing."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And usually these missing pieces, turn out to be really, really difficult."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And so this is completely and uniquely defined and we can analyze that mathematically."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "And we've also developed some approximations."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I can talk about that a little bit later."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "That would be sort of the top down approach, like say for Neumann's minimax theory, that's the theoretical optimal play of games."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And now we need to approximate it, put heuristics in, prune the tree, blah, blah, blah, and so on."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "So we can do that also with the ICSE model, but for general AI."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "It can also inspire those, and most researchers go bottom up, right?"}, {"time": 3420, "text": "They have the systems, they try to make it more general, more intelligent."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "It can inspire in which direction to go."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "So if you have some choice to make, right?"}, {"time": 3431, "text": "So how should I evaluate my system if I can't do cross validation?"}, {"time": 3435, "text": "How should I do my learning if my standard regularization doesn't work well?"}, {"time": 3441, "text": "So the answer is always this, we have a system which does everything, that's ICSE."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "It's just completely in the ivory tower, completely useless from a practical point of view."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "But you can look at it and see, ah, yeah, maybe I can take some aspects."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "And instead of Kolmogorov complexity, that just takes some compressors, which has been developed so far."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And for the planning, well, we have UCT, which has also been used in Go."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And at least it's inspired me a lot to have this formal definition."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "And if you look at other fields, like I always come back to physics because I have a physics background, think about the phenomenon of energy."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "That was long time a mysterious concept."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "And at some point it was completely formalized."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "And that really helped a lot."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "And you can point out a lot of these things which were first mysterious and vague, and then they have been rigorously formalized."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Speed and acceleration has been confused, right?"}, {"time": 3498, "text": "Until it was formally defined, yeah, there was a time like this."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And people often who don't have any background, still confuse it."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And this ICSE model or the intelligence definitions, which is sort of the dual to it, we come back to that later, formalizes the notion of intelligence uniquely and rigorously."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "So in a sense, it serves as kind of the light at the end of the tunnel."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So for, I mean, there's a million questions I could ask her."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "So maybe kind of, okay, let's feel around in the dark a little bit."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "So there's been here a deep mind, but in general, been a lot of breakthrough ideas, just like we've been saying around reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "So how do you see the progress in reinforcement learning is different?"}, {"time": 3544, "text": "Like which subset of ICSE does it occupy?"}, {"time": 3548, "text": "The current, like you said, maybe the Markov assumption is made quite often in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "There's other assumptions made in order to make the system work."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "What do you see as the difference connection between reinforcement learning and ICSE?"}, {"time": 3566, "text": "And so the major difference is that essentially all other approaches, they make stronger assumptions."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "So in reinforcement learning, the Markov assumption is that the next state or next observation only depends on the previous observation and not the whole history, which makes, of course, the mathematics much easier rather than dealing with histories."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Of course, they profit from it also, because then you have algorithms that run on current computers and do something practically useful."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "But for general AI, all the assumptions which are made by other approaches, we know already now they are limiting."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "So, for instance, usually you need a goddessity assumption in the MDP frameworks in order to learn."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "A goddessity essentially means that you can recover from your mistakes and that there are no traps in the environment."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "And if you make this assumption, then essentially you can go back to a previous state, go there a couple of times and then learn what statistics and what the state is like, and then in the long run perform well in this state."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "But there are no fundamental problems."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "But in real life, we know there can be one single action."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "One second of being inattentive while driving a car fast can ruin the rest of my life."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "I can become quadriplegic or whatever."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "So, and there's no recovery anymore."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "So, the real world is not ergodic, I always say."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "There are traps and there are situations where you are not recover from."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "And very little theory has been developed for this case."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "What about, what do you see in the context of IECSIA as the role of exploration?"}, {"time": 3667, "text": "Sort of, you mentioned in the real world you can get into trouble when we make the wrong decisions and really pay for it."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "But exploration seems to be fundamentally important for learning about this world, for gaining new knowledge."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So, is exploration baked in?"}, {"time": 3687, "text": "Another way to ask it, what are the potential to ask it, what are the parameters of IECSIA that can be controlled?"}, {"time": 3696, "text": "Yeah, I say the good thing is that there are no parameters to control."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "Some other people track knobs to control."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "And you can do that."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "I mean, you can modify IECSIA so that you have some knobs to play with if you want to."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "But the exploration is directly baked in."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And that comes from the Bayesian learning and the longterm planning."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "So these together already imply exploration."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "You can nicely and explicitly prove that for simple problems like so called bandit problems, where you say, to give a real world example, say you have two medical treatments, A and B, you don't know the effectiveness, you try A a little bit, B a little bit, but you don't want to harm too many patients."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "So you have to sort of trade off exploring."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "And at some point you want to explore and you can do the mathematics and figure out the optimal strategy."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "They talk about Bayesian agents, they're also non Bayesian agents, but it shows that this Bayesian framework by taking a prior or possible worlds, doing the Bayesian mixture, then the Bayes optimal decision with longterm planning that is important, automatically implies exploration, also to the proper extent, not too much exploration and not too little."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "It is very simple settings."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "In the IXE model, I was also able to prove that it is a self optimizing theorem or asymptotic optimality theorems, although they're only asymptotic, not finite time bounds."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "So it seems like the longterm planning is really important, but the longterm part of the planning is really important."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And also, I mean, maybe a quick tangent, how important do you think is removing the Markov assumption and looking at the full history?"}, {"time": 3805, "text": "Sort of intuitively, of course, it's important, but is it like fundamentally transformative to the entirety of the problem?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Like, cause we all, we make that assumption quite often."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "It's just throwing away the past."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "No, I think it's absolutely crucial."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "The question is whether there's a way to deal with it in a more heuristic and still sufficiently well way."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "So I have to come up with an example and fly, but you have some key event in your life, long time ago in some city or something, you realized that's a really dangerous street or whatever."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "And you want to remember that forever, in case you come back there."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Kind of a selective kind of memory."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "So you remember all the important events in the past, but somehow selecting the important is."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "That's very hard."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And I'm not concerned about just storing the whole history."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Just, you can calculate, human life says 30 or 100 years, doesn't matter, right?"}, {"time": 3868, "text": "How much data comes in through the vision system and the auditory system, you compress it a little bit, in this case, lossily and store it."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "We are soon in the means of just storing it."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "But you still need to the selection for the planning part and the compression for the understanding part."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "The raw storage I'm really not concerned about."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "And I think we should just store, if you develop an agent, preferably just store all the interaction history."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And then you build of course models on top of it and you compress it and you are selective, but occasionally you go back to the old data and reanalyze it based on your new experience you have."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Sometimes you are in school, you learn all these things you think is totally useless and much later you realize, oh, they were not so useless as you thought."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "I'm looking at you, linear algebra."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "So maybe let me ask about objective functions because that rewards, it seems to be an important part."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "The rewards are kind of given to the system."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "For a lot of people, the specification of the objective function is a key part of intelligence."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "The agent itself figuring out what is important."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "Is it possible within the IXE framework to yourself discover the reward based on which you should operate?"}, {"time": 3965, "text": "Okay, that will be a long answer."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So, and that is a very interesting question."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And I'm asked a lot about this question, where do the rewards come from?"}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And that depends."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "So, and then I give you now a couple of answers."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "So if you want to build agents, now let's start simple."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "So let's assume we want to build an agent based on the IXE model, which performs a particular task."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "Let's start with something super simple, like, I mean, super simple, like playing chess, or go or something, yeah."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "Then you just, the reward is winning the game is plus one, losing the game is minus one, done."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You apply this agent."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "If you have enough compute, you let it self play and it will learn the rules of the game, will play perfect chess after some while, problem solved."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "Okay, so if you have more complicated problems, then you may believe that you have the right reward, but it's not."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "So a nice, cute example is the elevator control that is also in Rich Sutton's book, which is a great book, by the way."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So you control the elevator and you think, well, maybe the reward should be coupled to how long people wait in front of the elevator."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "Long wait is bad."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "You program it and you do it."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "And what happens is the elevator eagerly picks up all the people, but never drops them off."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So then you realize, oh, maybe the time in the elevator also counts, so you minimize the sum, yeah?"}, {"time": 4056, "text": "And the elevator does that, but never picks up the people in the 10th floor and the top floor because in expectation, it's not worth it."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "Just let them stay."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So even in apparently simple problems, you can make mistakes, yeah?"}, {"time": 4071, "text": "And that's what in more serious contexts AGI safety researchers consider."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "So now let's go back to general agents."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "So assume you want to build an agent, which is generally useful to humans, yeah?"}, {"time": 4085, "text": "So you have a household robot, yeah?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And it should do all kinds of tasks."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "So in this case, the human should give the reward on the fly."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "I mean, maybe it's pre trained in the factory and that there's some sort of internal reward for the battery level or whatever, yeah?"}, {"time": 4099, "text": "But so it does the dishes badly, you punish the robot, it does it good, you reward the robot and then train it to a new task, yeah, like a child, right?"}, {"time": 4108, "text": "So you need the human in the loop."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "If you want a system, which is useful to the human."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And as long as these agents stay subhuman level, that should work reasonably well, apart from these examples."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "It becomes critical if they become on a human level."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "It's like with children, small children, you have reasonably well under control, they become older, the reward technique doesn't work so well anymore."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "So then finally, so this would be agents, which are just, you could say slaves to the humans, yeah?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "So if you are more ambitious and just say, we want to build a new species of intelligent beings, we put them on a new planet and we want them to develop this planet or whatever."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "So we don't give them any reward."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "So what could we do?"}, {"time": 4156, "text": "And you could try to come up with some reward functions like it should maintain itself, the robot, it should maybe multiply, build more robots, right?"}, {"time": 4168, "text": "And maybe all kinds of things which you find useful, but that's pretty hard, right?"}, {"time": 4174, "text": "What does self maintenance mean?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "What does it mean to build a copy?"}, {"time": 4178, "text": "Should it be exact copy, an approximate copy?"}, {"time": 4180, "text": "And so that's really hard, but Laurent also at DeepMind developed a beautiful model."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "So it just took the ICSE model and coupled the rewards to information gain."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "So he said the reward is proportional to how much the agent had learned about the world."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "And you can rigorously, formally, uniquely define that in terms of archival versions, okay?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "So if you put that in, you get a completely autonomous agent."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "And actually, interestingly, for this agent, we can prove much stronger result than for the general agent, which is also nice."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And if you let this agent loose, it will be in a sense, the optimal scientist."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "It is absolutely curious to learn as much as possible about the world."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "And of course, it will also have a lot of instrumental goals, right?"}, {"time": 4227, "text": "In order to learn, it needs to at least survive, right?"}, {"time": 4229, "text": "A dead agent is not good for anything."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "So it needs to have self preservation."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And if it builds small helpers, acquiring more information, it will do that, yeah?"}, {"time": 4239, "text": "If exploration, space exploration or whatever is necessary, right, to gathering information and develop it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "So it has a lot of instrumental goals falling on this information gain."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "And this agent is completely autonomous of us."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "No rewards necessary anymore."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "Yeah, of course, it could find a way to game the concept of information and get stuck in that library that you mentioned beforehand with a very large number of books."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "The first agent had this problem."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "It would get stuck in front of an old TV screen, which has just had white noise."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "Yeah, white noise, yeah."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "But the second version can deal with at least stochasticity."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "Yeah, what about curiosity?"}, {"time": 4283, "text": "This kind of word, curiosity, creativity, is that kind of the reward function being of getting new information?"}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Is that similar to idea of kind of injecting exploration for its own sake inside the reward function?"}, {"time": 4301, "text": "Do you find this at all appealing, interesting?"}, {"time": 4304, "text": "I think that's a nice definition."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "Curiosity is rewards."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Sorry, curiosity is exploration for its own sake."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Yeah, I would accept that."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "But most curiosity, well, in humans, and especially in children, is not just for its own sake, but for actually learning about the environment and for behaving better."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So I think most curiosity is tied in the end towards performing better."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "Well, okay, so if intelligence systems need to have this reward function, let me, you're an intelligence system, currently passing the torrent test quite effectively."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "What's the reward function of our human intelligence existence?"}, {"time": 4353, "text": "What's the reward function that Marcus Hutter is operating under?"}, {"time": 4357, "text": "Okay, to the first question, the biological reward function is to survive and to spread, and very few humans sort of are able to overcome this biological reward function."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "But we live in a very nice world where we have lots of spare time and can still survive and spread, so we can develop arbitrary other interests, which is quite interesting."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "On top of that."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "On top of that, yeah."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "But the survival and spreading sort of is, I would say, the goal or the reward function of humans, so that the core one."},

of life and the reward function."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "My own meaning of life and reward function is to find an AGI to build it."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Okay, let's dissect the X even further."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "So one of the assumptions is kind of infinity keeps creeping up everywhere, which, what are your thoughts on kind of bounded rationality and sort of the nature of our existence and intelligence systems is that we're operating always under constraints, under limited time, limited resources."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "How does that, how do you think about that within the IXE framework, within trying to create an AGI system that operates under these constraints?"}, {"time": 4446, "text": "Yeah, that is one of the criticisms about IXE, that it ignores computation and completely."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "And some people believe that intelligence is inherently tied to what's bounded resources."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "What do you think on this one point?"}, {"time": 4461, "text": "Do you think it's, do you think the bounded resources are fundamental to intelligence?"}, {"time": 4467, "text": "I would say that an intelligence notion, which ignores computational limits is extremely useful."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "A good intelligence notion, which includes these resources would be even more useful, but we don't have that yet."},

cells, something in physics, these theories, I mean, become more and more crazy and harder and harder to compute."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Well, in the end, of course, we need to do something with this model, but this is more a nuisance than a feature."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And I'm sometimes wondering if artificial intelligence would not sit in a computer science department, but in a philosophy department, then this computational focus would be probably significantly less."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "I mean, think about the induction problem is more in the philosophy department."},

course, once we have figured out the first problem, so intelligence without computational resources, then the next and very good question is, could we improve it by including computational resources,

4555, "text": "That's actually quite a deep idea, or even to at least to think about big picture philosophical questions, big picture questions, even in the computer science department."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "But you've mentioned approximation."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "Sort of, there's a lot of infinity, a lot of huge resources needed."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "Are there approximations to IXE that within the IXE framework that are useful?"}, {"time": 4579, "text": "Yeah, we have developed a couple of approximations."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And what we do there is that the Solomov induction part, which was find the shortest program describing your data, we just replace it by standard data compressors."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "And the better compressors get, the better this part will become."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "We focus on a particular compressor called context tree weighting, which is pretty amazing, not so well known."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It has beautiful theoretical properties, also works reasonably well in practice."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "So we use that for the approximation of the induction and the learning and the prediction part."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "And for the planning part, we essentially just took the ideas from a computer go from 2006."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "It was Java Zipes Bari, also now at DeepMind, who developed the so called UCT algorithm, upper confidence bound for trees algorithm on top of the Monte Carlo tree search."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "So we approximate this planning part by sampling."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "And it's successful on some small toy problems."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "We don't want to lose the generality, right?"}, {"time": 4653, "text": "And that's sort of the handicap, right?"}, {"time": 4654, "text": "If you want to be general, you have to give up something."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "So, but this single agent was able to play small games like Coon poker and Tic Tac Toe and

familiar with it."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "He developed it while I was in his lab."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "Yeah, so the Ghetto Machine, to explain it briefly, you give it a task."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "It could be a simple task as, you know, finding prime factors in numbers, right?"}, {"time": 4712, "text": "You can formally write it down."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "There's a very slow algorithm to do that."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "Just try all the factors, yeah."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Or play chess, right?"}, {"time": 4719, "text": "Optimally, you write the algorithm to minimax to the end of the game."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "So you write down what the Ghetto Machine should do."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "Then it will take part of its resources to run this program and other part of its resources to improve this program."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And when it finds an improved version, which provably computes the same answer."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So that's the key part, yeah."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "It needs to prove by itself that this change of program still satisfies the original specification."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "And if it does so, then it replaces the original program by the improved program."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And by definition, it does the same job, but just faster, okay?"}, {"time": 4757, "text": "And then, you know, it proves over it and over it."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And it's developed in a way that all parts of this Ghetto Machine can self improve, but it stays provably consistent with the original specification."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So from this perspective, it has nothing to do with iXe."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "But if you would now put iXe as the starting axioms in, it would run iXe, but you know, that takes forever."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "But then if it finds a provable speed up of iXe, it would replace it by this and this and this."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "And maybe eventually it comes up with a model which is still the iXe model."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "It cannot be, I mean, just for the knowledgeable reader, iXe is incomputable and that can prove that therefore there cannot be a computable exact algorithm computers."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "There needs to be some approximations and this is not dealt with the Ghetto Machine."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "So you have to do something about it."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "But there's the iXe TL model, which is finitely computable, which we could put in."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "Which part of iXe is noncomputable?"}, {"time": 4819, "text": "The Solomonov induction part."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "The induction, okay, so."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "But there is ways of getting computable approximations of the iXe model, so then it's at least computable."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "It is still way beyond any resources anybody will ever have, but then the Ghetto Machine could sort of improve it further and further in an exact way."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "So is it theoretically possible that the Ghetto Machine process could improve?"}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Isn't iXe already optimal?"}, {"time": 4851, "text": "It is optimal in terms of the reward collected over its interaction cycles, but it takes infinite time to produce one action."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "And the world continues whether you want it or not."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "So the model is assuming you had an oracle, which solved this problem, and then in the next 100 milliseconds or the reaction time you need gives the answer, then iXe is optimal."}, {"time": 4878, "text": "It's optimal in sense of also from learning efficiency and data efficiency, but not in terms of computation time."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And then the Ghetto Machine in theory, but probably not provably could make it go faster."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "Those two components are super interesting."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "The sort of the perfect intelligence combined with self improvement, sort of provable self improvement since you're always getting the correct answer and you're improving."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "Beautiful ideas."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Okay, so you've also mentioned that different kinds of things in the chase of solving this reward, sort of optimizing for the goal, interesting human things could emerge."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "So is there a place for consciousness within iXe?"}, {"time": 4930, "text": "Where does, maybe you can comment, because I suppose we humans are just another instantiation of iXe agents and we seem to have consciousness."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "You say humans are an instantiation of an iXe agent?"}, {"time": 4944, "text": "Well, that would be amazing, but I think that's not true even for the smartest and most rational humans."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "I think maybe we are very crude approximations."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "I mean, I tend to believe, again, I'm Russian, so I tend to believe our flaws are part of the optimal."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So we tend to laugh off and criticize our flaws and I tend to think that that's actually close to an optimal behavior."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "Well, some flaws, if you think more carefully about it, are actually not flaws, yeah, but I think there are still enough flaws."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "As a student of history, I think all the suffering that we've endured as a civilization, it's possible that that's the optimal amount of suffering we need to endure to minimize longterm suffering."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "That's your Russian background, I think."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "That's the Russian."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Whether humans are or not instantiations of an iXe agent, do you think there's a consciousness of something that could emerge in a computational form or framework like iXe?"}, {"time": 5009, "text": "Let me also ask you a question."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "Do you think I'm conscious?"}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Yeah, that's a good question."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "That tie is confusing me, but I think so."},

dressed similarly to you."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "That because there's a kind of flamboyant, interesting, complex behavior pattern that sells that you're human and you're conscious."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "But why do you ask?"}, {"time": 5046, "text": "Was it a yes or was it a no?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "Yes, I think you're conscious, yes."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "So, and you explained sort of somehow why, but you infer that from my behavior, right?"}, {"time": 5058, "text": "You can never be sure about that."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And I think the same thing will happen with any intelligent agent we develop if it behaves in a way sufficiently close to humans or maybe even not humans."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "I mean, maybe a dog is also sometimes a little bit self conscious, right?"}, {"time": 5075, "text": "So if it behaves in a way where we attribute typically consciousness, we would attribute consciousness to these intelligent systems."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And I see probably in particular that of course doesn't answer the question whether it's really conscious."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "And that's the big hard problem of consciousness."},

close enough to consciousness from a perspective of AGI that the distinction of the hard problem of consciousness is not an interesting one?"}, {"time": 5111, "text": "I think we don't have to worry about the consciousness problem, especially the hard problem for developing AGI."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "I think, you know, we progress."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "At some point we have solved all the technical problems and this system will behave intelligent and then super intelligent."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "And this consciousness will emerge."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "I mean, definitely it will display behavior which we will interpret as conscious."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "And then it's a philosophical question."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Did this consciousness really emerge or is it a zombie which just, you know, fakes everything?"}, {"time": 5143, "text": "We still don't have to figure that out."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "Although it may be interesting, at least from a philosophical point of view, it's very interesting, but it may also be sort of practically interesting."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "You know, there's some people saying, if it's just faking consciousness and feelings, you know, then we don't need to be concerned about, you know, rights."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "But if it's real conscious and has feelings, then we need to be concerned, yeah."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "I can't wait till the day where AI systems exhibit consciousness because it'll truly be some of the hardest ethical questions of what we do with that."}, {"time":

before you were born, the Tamagotchi?"}, {"time": 5187, "text": "Freaking born."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "How dare you, sir?"}, {"time": 5190, "text": "Why, that's the, you're young, right?"},

have any of those fun things."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "But you have heard about this Tamagotchi, which was, you know, really, really primitive, actually, for the time it was, and, you know, you could raise, you know, this, and kids got so attached to it and, you know, didn't want to let it die and probably, if we would have asked, you know, the children, do you think this Tamagotchi is conscious?"}, {"time": 5219, "text": "They would have said yes."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "Half of them would have said yes, I would guess."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "I think that's kind of a beautiful thing, actually, because that consciousness, ascribing consciousness, seems to create a deeper connection."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "Which is a powerful thing."}, {"time": 5232, "text":

serious work on AGI, as of at least earlier, and DeepMind represents serious work on AGI these days."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "But why, in your sense, is the AGI community so small or has been so small until maybe DeepMind came along?"}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Like, why aren't more people seriously working on human level and superhuman level intelligence from a formal perspective?"}, {"time": 5268, "text": "Okay, from a formal perspective, that's sort of an extra point."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "So I think there are a couple of reasons."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "I mean, AI came in waves, right?"}, {"time": 5276, "text": "You know, AI winters and AI summers, and then there were big promises which were not fulfilled, and people got disappointed."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And that narrow AI solving particular problems, which seemed to require intelligence, was always to some extent successful, and there were improvements, small steps."}, {"time": 5299, "text": "And if you build something which is useful for society or industrial useful, then there's a lot of funding."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "So I guess it was in parts the money, which drives people to develop a specific system solving specific tasks."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "But you would think that, at least in university, you should be able to do ivory tower research."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And that was probably better a long time ago, but even nowadays, there's quite some pressure of doing applied research or translational research, and it's harder to get grants as a theorist."}, {"time": 5336,

maybe a small number were still interested in formalizing intelligence and thinking of general intelligence, but not much came up, right?"}, {"time": 5357, "text": "Well, not much great stuff came up."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So what do you think, we talked about the formal big light at the end of the tunnel, but from the engineering perspective, what do you think it takes to build an AGI system?"}, {"time": 5370, "text": "Is that, and I don't know if that's a stupid question or a distinct question from everything we've been talking about at AICSI, but what do you see as the steps that are necessary to take to start to try to build something?"}, {"time": 5383, "text": "So you want a blueprint now, and then you go off and do it?"}, {"time": 5386, "text": "That's the whole point of this conversation, trying to squeeze that in there."}, {"time": 5389, "text": "Now, is there, I mean, what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 5391, "text": "Is it in the robotics space or something that has a body and tries to explore the world?"}, {"time": 5396, "text": "Is it in the reinforcement learning space, like the efforts with AlphaZero and AlphaStar that are kind of exploring how you can

of course we need robots for all kinds of things, but for solving the big problem, at least at this stage, I think it's not necessary."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "But the answer is also yes, that I think the most promising approach is that you have an agent and that can be a virtual agent in a computer interacting with an environment, possibly a 3D simulated environment like in many computer games."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "If you talk about objects on top of each other in space and flying and cars and so on, and the agent has no experience with even virtual 3D worlds, it's probably hard to grasp."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "So if you develop an abstract agent, say we take the mathematical path and we just want to build an agent which can prove theorems and becomes a better and better

all."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "Might not be the case."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "If you just have regularity, do you?"}, {"time": 1663, "text": "That fits full of I mean, physics is successful."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "You know, it's full of of laws that tell us a lot of detail about how the universe works."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "I mean, it could be the case that, you know, the 10 to the 90th particles in the universe, they will do their own thing, but they don't."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "They all follow."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "We already know they all follow basically physical, the same physical laws."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And that's something that's a very profound fact about the universe."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "What conclusion you draw from that is unclear."},

different conclusions about it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "But the fact is, you know, right now, I mean, I happen to be interested, actually, I've just restarted a long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "I'm kind of like, come on, I'm on a bit of a quest, which I'm about to make more public, to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory of physics."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "We'll come to that."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And I just had a lot of conversations with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm really excited on your take, because I think you have a fascinating take on the the fundamental nature of our reality from a physics perspective."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Okay, let's take a step back."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "What is computation?"}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Operationally, computation is following rules."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "That's kind of it."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "I mean, computation is the result is the process of systematically following rules."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And it is the thing that happens when you do that."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So taking initial conditions are taking inputs and following rules."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "I mean, what are you following rules on?"}, {"time": 1766, "text": "So there has to be some data, some unnecessarily, it can be something where there's a, you know, very simple input."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And then you're following these rules."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "And you'd say there's not really much data going into this."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "It's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule, if you want to."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So I think the question is, is there a robust notion of computation?"}, {"time": 1791, "text": "That is, what does robust mean?"}, {"time": 1795, "text": "What I mean by that is something like this."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So So one of the things in a different in another physics, something like energy, okay, the different forms of energy, there's, but somehow energy is a robust concept that doesn't, isn't particular to kinetic energy, or, you know, nuclear energy, or whatever else, there's a robust idea of energy."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So one of the things you might ask is, is the robust idea of computation?"}, {"time": 1819, "text": "Or does it matter that this computation is running in a Turing machine?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "This computation is running in a, you know, CMOS, silicon, CPU, this computation is running in a fluid system in the weather, those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it's running in?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And is there?"}, {"time": 1843, "text": "I mean, it wasn't obvious that there was."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So it's worth understanding the history and how we got to where we are right now."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Because, you know, to say that there is, is a statement in part about our universe."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's about what actually can exist for us."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "Maybe you can also comment because energy, as a concept is robust."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "But there's also its intricate, complicated relationship with matter, with mass, is very interesting, of particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carry force and particles that have mass."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "These kinds of ideas, they seem to map to each other, at least in the mathematical sense."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Is there a connection between energy and mass and computation?"}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Or are these completely disjoint ideas?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "We don't know yet."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "The things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics may well lead to such a connection, but there is no known connection at this time."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So can you elaborate a little bit more on what, how do you think about computation?"}, {"time": 1920, "text": "So I mean, let's, let's tell a little bit of a historical story."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So, you know, back, go back 150 years, people were making mechanical calculators of various kinds."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And, you know, the typical thing was you want an adding machine, you go to the adding machine store, basically, you want a multiplying machine, you go to the multiplying machine store, they're different pieces of hardware."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And so that means that, at least at the level of that kind of computation, and those kinds of pieces of hardware, there isn't a robust notion of computation, there's the adding machine kind of computation, there's the multiplying machine notion of computation, and they're disjoint."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So what happened in around 1900, people started imagining, particularly in the context of mathematical logic, could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function, right?"}, {"time": 1966, "text": "And they came up with things, this idea of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "And it didn't work."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "There were reasonable functions that people could come up with that were not represented using the primitives of primitive recursion."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Okay, so then, then along comes 1931, and Godel's theorem, and so on."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "And as in looking back, one can see that as part of the process of establishing Godel's theorem, Godel basically showed how you could compile arithmetic, how you could basically compile logical statements like this statement is unprovable into arithmetic."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "So what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense that's capable of representing all kinds of other things."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "And then Turing came along 1936, came up with Turing machines."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had come up with lambda calculus."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea of what computation might be."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And so, and then there started to be other ideas, you know, register machines, other kinds of other kinds of representations of computation."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And the big surprise was, they all turned out to be equivalent."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So in other words, it might have been the case, like those old adding machines and multiplying machines, that, you know, Turing had his idea of computation, Church had his idea of computation, and they were just different."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But it isn't true."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "They're actually all equivalent."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So then by, I would say the 1970s or so in sort of the computation, computer science, computation theory area, people had sort of said, oh, Turing machines are kind of what computation is."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "Physicists were still holding out saying, no, no, no, that's just not how the universe works."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "We've got all these differential equations."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "We've got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "The universe is not a Turing machine."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "The, you know, the Turing machines are a small subset of the things that we make in microprocessors and engineering structures and so on."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "So probably actually through my work in the 1980s about sort of the relationship between computation and models of physics, it became a little less clear that there would be, that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can happen in physics and what happens in things like Turing machines."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "And I think probably by now people would mostly think, and by the way, brains were another kind of element of this."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And Turing wasn't sure either."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "But although he was a little bit, he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "But I would say by probably sometime in the 1980s, there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that yes, this notion of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "Now, the next question is, okay, you can have a universal Turing machine that's capable of being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And, you know, this idea of universal computation, it's an important idea, this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and program it with different pieces of software."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "You know, that's kind of the idea that launched most modern technology."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "I mean, that's kind of, that's the idea that launched computer revolution software, etc."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So important idea."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "But the thing that's still kind of holding out from that idea is, okay, there is this universal computation thing, but seems hard to get to."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "It seems like you want to make a universal computer, you have to kind of have a microprocessor with, you know, a million gates in it, and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that level of computational sophistication."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "Okay, so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered in the early 80s, looking at these things called cellular automata, which are really simple computational systems, the thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were very, very simple, they were doing things that were as sophisticated as they did when their rules were much more complicated."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So it didn't look like, you know, this idea, oh, to get sophisticated computation, you have to build something with very sophisticated rules."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "That idea didn't seem to pan out."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "And instead, it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous, even in systems with incredibly simple rules."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And so that led to this thing that I call the principle of computational equivalence, which basically says, when you have a system that follows rules of any kind, then whenever the system isn't doing things that are, in some sense, obviously simple, then the computation that the behavior of the system corresponds to is of equivalence sophistication."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So that means that when you kind of go from the very, very, very simplest things you can imagine, then quite quickly, you hit this kind of threshold above which everything is equivalent in its computational sophistication."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Not obvious that would be the case."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "I mean, that's a science fact."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Well, no, hold on a second."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "So this you've opened with a new kind of science."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "I mean, I remember it was a huge eye opener that such simple things can create such complexity."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And yes, there's an equivalence, but it's not a fact."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "It just appears to, I mean, it's as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things are."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "But let me ask sort of, you just brought up previously, kind of like the communities of computer scientists with their Turing machines, the physicists with their universe, and whoever the heck, maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "What's your sense in the equivalence?"}, {"time": 2336, "text": "You've shown through your work that simple rules can create equivalently complex Turing machine systems, right?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "Is the universe equivalent to the kinds of Turing machines?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "Is the human brain a kind of Turing machine?"}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Do you see those things basically blending together?"}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Or is there still a mystery about how disjoint they are?"}, {"time": 2361, "text": "Well, my guess is that they all blend together, but we don't know that for sure yet."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "I mean, this, you know, I should say, I said rather glibly that the principle of computational equivalence is sort of a science fact."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And I was using air quotes for the science fact, because when you, it is a, I mean, just to talk about that for a second."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "The thing is that it has a complicated epistemological character, similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "What is the second law of thermodynamics?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Is it a law of nature?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Is it a thing that is true of the physical world?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Is it something which is mathematically provable?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Is it something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world?"}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Is it, in some sense, a definition of heat, perhaps?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Well, it's a combination of those things."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And it's the same thing with the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "And in some sense, the principle of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation, because it's telling you there is a thing, there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems and doesn't depend on the details of each individual system."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And that's why we can meaningfully talk about a thing called computation."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And we're not stuck talking about, oh, there's computation in Turing machine number 3785, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "That's why there is a robust notion like that."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "Now, on the other hand, can we prove the principle of computational equivalence?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Can we prove it as a mathematical result?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Well, the answer is, actually, we've got some nice results along those lines that say, throw me a random system with very simple rules."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "Well, in a couple of cases, we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "Just to link on that point, the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "But is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex?"}, {"time": 2495, "text": "That you've mentioned that you cross a threshold."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So there are various indicators."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So, for example, one thing would be, is it capable of universal computation?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "That is, given the system, do there exist initial conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you want, to compute primes, to compute pi, to do whatever you want?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So that's an indicator."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "So we know in a couple of examples that, yes, the simplest candidates that could conceivably have that property do have that property."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And that's what the principle of computational equivalence might suggest."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "But this principle of computational equivalence, one question about it is, is it true for the physical world?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "It might be true for all these things we come up with, the Turing machines, the cellular automata, whatever else."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Is it true for our actual physical world?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Is it true for the brains, which are an element of the physical world?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "We don't know for sure."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "And that's not the type of question that we will have a definitive answer to, because there's a sort of scientific induction issue."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "You can say, well, it's true for all these brains, but this person over here is really special, and it's not true for them."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And the only way that that cannot be what happens is if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics, and it turns out to correspond to, let's say, a simple program."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "If that is the case, then we will basically have reduced physics to a branch of mathematics, in the sense that we will not be, you know, right now with physics, we're like, well, this is the theory that, you know, this is the rules that apply here."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "But in the middle of that, you know, right by that black hole, maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel back."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "But if we can get to the point where we actually have, this is the fundamental theory of physics, here it is, it's this program, run this program, and you will get our universe, then we've kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some, what turns out to be very difficult, irreducibly difficult, mathematical problems."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "But it no longer is the case that we can say that somebody can come in and say, whoops, you know, you will write about all these things about Turing machines, but you're wrong about the physical universe, we know there's sort of ground truth about what's happening in the physical universe."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Now, I happen to think, I mean, you asked me at an interesting time, because I'm just in the middle of starting to to re energize my, my project to kind of study fundamental theory of physics."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "As of today, I'm very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's going to be possible to to see that the universe really is computational in that sense."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "But I don't know, because we're betting against, you know, we're betting against the universe, so to speak."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And I didn't, you know, it's not like, you know, when I spend a lot of my life building technology, and then I know what what's in there, right?"},

universe."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "I'm not in that position, so to speak."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "What kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from?"},

this very clean structures, it's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules can create immense complexity."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "But what kind, you know, is that actually, are cellular automata sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics?"}, {"time": 2732, "text": "Just to give, can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create?"}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Well, so this is a slightly complicated issue, because as soon as you have universal computation, you can, in principle, simulate anything with anything."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "But it is not a natural thing to do."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And if you're asking, were you to try to find our physical universe by looking at possible programs

other words, if you say a cellular automaton, it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid, and it's very, you know, and every cell is updated in synchrony at a particular, you know, when there's a click of a clock, so to speak, and it goes a tick of a clock, and every cell gets updated at the same time."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "That's a very specific very rigid kind of thing."},

what we see, what emerges for us as physical space, for example, comes from something that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "And so I've been for a long time interested in kind of what are the most structuralist structures that we can set up."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "And actually, what I had thought about for ages is using graphs, networks, where essentially, so let's talk about space, for example."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So what is space?"}, {"time": 2836, "text": "It's a kind of a question one might ask."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "Back in the early days of quantum mechanics, for example, people said, oh, for sure, space is going to be discrete, because all these other things we're finding are discrete."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "But that never worked out in physics."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And so space in physics today is always treated as this continuous thing, just like Euclid imagined it."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "I mean, the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is, you know, a point is something which has no part."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "In other words, there are points that are arbitrarily small, and there's a continuum of possible positions of points."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "And the question is, is that true?"}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And so for example, if we look at, I don't know, fluid like air or water, we might say, oh, it's a continuous fluid."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But actually, we know, because we know the physics of it, that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecules bouncing around, and only in the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum."}, {"time": 2890,

computational?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "So there are a couple of possibilities."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "It could be computational, somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine, or it could be fundamentally not."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So how could it not be?"}, {"time": 2917, "text": "It could not be, so a Turing machine essentially deals with integers, whole numbers, at some level."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And you know, it can do things like it can add one to a number, it can do things like this."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "And it can also store whatever the heck it did."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "Yes, it has an infinite storage."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "But when one thinks about doing physics, or sort of idealized physics, or idealized mathematics, one can

wrong."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "And that's the risk you take if you're trying to sort of do things about nature, is you might just be wrong."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "For me personally, it's kind of a strange thing."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "I've spent a lot of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody cares about, but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense, in the sense you build your technology and it does what it does."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "You don't get to have sort of the muon case, the tau lepton case and so on."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "Because they all have to be emergent somehow, something deeper."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "So that means it's sort of inevitable, it's a little hard to talk about what the sort of underlying structuralist structure actually is."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Do you think human beings have the cognitive capacity to understand, if we're to discover it, to understand the kinds of simple structure from which these laws can emerge?"}, {"time": 3121, "text": "Like, do you think that's a good question?"}, {"time": 3124, "text": "Well, here's what I think."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle of this right now."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I'm telling you that I think this, yeah, I mean, this human has a hard time understanding, you know, a bunch of the things that are going on."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "But what happens in understanding is one builds waypoints."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "I mean, if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics, starting from, you know, counting back in, you know, whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago, whatever it was, right, that would be really difficult."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "But what happens is we build waypoints that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And we see the same thing happening in language."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "You know, when we invent a word for something, it provides kind of a cognitive anchor, a kind of a waypoint that lets us, you know, like a podcast or something."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "You could be explaining, well, it's a thing which works this way, that way, the other way."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "But as soon as you have the word podcast and people kind of societally understand it, you start to be able to build on top of that."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And so I think that's kind of the story of science actually, too."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "I mean, science is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for understanding something, then we can build on top of it."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "You know, we have the idea of, I don't know, differential equations we can build on top of that."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "We have this idea, that idea."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "So my hope is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer, and there's no waypoints in between, then we're toast."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "We won't be able to do that."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "Well, eventually we might."}, {"time": 3213,

this principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "And it's sort of a core idea that one has to understand, I think, which is question is, you're doing a computation, you can figure out what happens in the computation just by running every step in the computation and seeing what happens."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out, you know,

reducibility."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "It's like, we've got these equations, and we can just solve them, and we can figure out what's going to happen."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "We don't have to trace all of those steps, we just jump ahead because we solve these equations."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you don't always get to do that."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible, in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow each step and see what happens."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "Well, if you're saying, well, we, with our brains, we're a lot smarter, we don't have to mess around like the little cellular automaton going through and updating all those cells."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "But if the principle of computational equivalence is right, that's not going to be correct, because it means that there's us doing our computation in our brains, there's a little cellular automaton doing its computation, and the principle of computational equivalence says these two computations are fundamentally equivalent."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "So that means we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than the cellular automaton and jump ahead,

that's a really powerful idea."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on, that we're all, we and the cellular automaton are the same."}, {"time": 3382, "text":

"text": "You have to run the universe for that."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?"}, {"time": 3398, "text": "But the problem is, to know whether you're right, you have to have some computational reducibility, because we are embedded in the universe."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "If the only way to know whether we get the universe is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that, because it just ran for 14.6 billion years or whatever."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And we can't rerun it, so to speak."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "So we have to hope that there are pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say, yes, I can recognize those are electrons there."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "And I think that it's a feature of computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "It's sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "The question of whether they land in the right place and whether we can sort of build a theory based on them is unclear."}, {"time": 3440, "text": "But to this point about whether we as observers in the

reducibility, it won't work, can't work."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "But I think this question about how observers operate, it's one of the features of science over the last 100 years particularly, has been that every time we get more realistic about observers, we learn a bit more about science."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "So for example, relativity was all about observers don't get to say what's simultaneous with what."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide what's simultaneous."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Or for example, in thermodynamics, observers don't get to say the position of every single molecule in a gas."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "They can only see the kind of large scale features, and that's why the second law of

the model is this, I discover it's equivalent."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "And that's quite encouraging because it's like I could say, well, I'm going to look at trivalent graphs with three edges for each node and so on, or I could look at this special kind of graph, or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "And turns out that the things I'm now looking at, everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Well, a typical way to think about it is, well, so you might have some collection of tuples, collection of, let's say, numbers."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four, just collections of numbers, triples of numbers, let's say, quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And you have all these sort of floating little tuples."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "They're not in any particular order."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "And that sort of floating collection of tuples, and I told you this was abstract, represents the whole universe."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "The only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same, it's the same, so to speak."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol, let's say at the same position of the tuple, at the first element of the tuple, then that represents a relation."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "So let me try and peel this back."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "I told you it's abstract, but this is the..."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "So the relationship is formed by some aspect of sameness."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "But so think about it in terms of a graph."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "So a graph, a bunch of nodes, let's say you number each node, then what is a graph?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "A graph is a set of pairs that say this node has an edge connecting it to this other node."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "And a graph is just a collection of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "So this is a generalization of that, in which instead of having pairs, you have arbitrary n tuples."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "That's the whole story."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "And now the question is, okay, so that might represent the state of the universe."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "How does the universe evolve?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "What does the universe do?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "And so the answer is that what I'm looking at is a transformation rules on these hypergraphs."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "In other words, you say this, whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph that looks like this, turn it into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "So on a graph, it might be when you see the subgraph, when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out in this particular way, then rewrite it as this other graph."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "And so that's the whole story."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "So the question is what, uh, so now you say, I mean, as I say, this is quite abstract."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And one of the questions is, uh, where do you do those updating?"}, {"time": 3927, "text": "So you've got this giant graph."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "What triggers the updating, like what's the, what's the ripple effect of it?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Is it, uh, and I suspect everything's discreet even in time."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So the question is where do you do the updates?"}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they apply."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "And you do them, you do them."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "The order in which the updates is done is not defined."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "That is the, you can do them."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "So there may be many possible orderings for these updates."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Now, the point is if imagine you're an observer in this universe."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So, and you say, did something get updated?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Well, you don't in any sense know until you yourself have been updated."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affects an event that's in you."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "That doesn't even feel like observation."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "That's like, that's something else."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "You're just part of the whole thing."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "Yes, you're part of it."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "But, but even to have, so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to is this causal network of what event affects what other event."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "I'm not making a big statement about sort of the structure of the observer."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument that what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites is not something that any observer, any conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Because the only thing the observer can be affected by is this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected by other events that happen in the universe."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "So the only thing you have to look at is the causal network."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "You don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting that's happening."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "So these rewrites are happening wherever they, they happen wherever they feel like."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Causal network."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Is there, you said that there's not really, so the idea would be an undefined, like what gets updated?"}, {"time": 4046, "text": "The, the sequence of things is undefined."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "It's a, yes."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "That's what you mean by the causal network, but then the call, no, the causal network is given that an update has happened."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "That's an event."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "Then the question is, is that event causally related to, does that event, if that event didn't happen, then some future event couldn't happen yet."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "And so you build up this network of what affects what."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "And so what that does, so when you build up that network, that's kind of the observable aspect of the universe in some sense."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "And so then you can ask questions about, you know, how robust is that observable network of the, what's happening in the universe."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "So here's where it starts getting kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules, the order of rewrites does not matter to the causal network."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "This is equivalent to the Church Rosser property or the confluence property of rewrite rules."}, {"time": 4104,

pieces."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Doesn't matter what order you do that in, you'll always get the same answer."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon that causes for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules that causes the causal network to be independent of the microscopic order of rewritings."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "Why is that property important?"}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Because it implies special relativity."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "I mean, the reason it's important is that that property, special relativity says you can look at these sort of, you can look at different reference frames."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "You can have different, you can be looking at your notion of what space and what's time can be different depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed, depending on whether you're doing this, that, and the other."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the same."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "That's what the principle of special relativity says, is the laws of physics are the same independent of your reference frame."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Well, turns out this sort of change of the microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame, or at least there's a sub part of how that works that's equivalent to change a reference frame."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time in forever, it's possible for an underlying microscopic theory to imply special relativity, to be able to derive it."},

of time in the universe."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "It might not be the case that that's what would lead to the possibility of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens."}, {"time": 4211,

definite thread of time."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "It sounds like that kind of idea of time, even space, would be emergent from the system."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "No, I mean, it's not a fundamental part of the system."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "No, no, it's a fundamental level."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "All you've got is a bunch of nodes connected by hyper edges or whatever."},

"text": "And imagine you have something like a, you know, like a honeycomb graph, or you have a hexagon, a bunch of hexagons."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "You know, that graph at a microscopic level, it's just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "But at a macroscopic level, you say that looks like a honeycomb, you know, lattice, it looks like a two dimensional, you know, manifold of some kind, it looks like a two dimensional thing."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "If you connect it differently, if you just connect all the nodes one, one to another, and kind of a sort of linked list type structure, then you'd say, well, that looks like a one dimensional space."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "But at the microscopic level, all these are just networks with nodes, the macroscopic level, they look like something that's like one of our sort of familiar kinds of space."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "And it's the same thing with these hyper graphs."}, {"time": 4282,

properties of this kind of system that are very beautiful, actually, and very suggestive."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right, because it's very clean."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "I mean, you start with nothing."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And everything gets built up, everything about space, everything about time, everything about matter."},

works."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "Now, do I on the other hand, the thing that that I find very confusing is, let's say we succeed, let's say we can say this particular sort of hypergraph rewriting rule gives the universe just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times, and you'll get everything, you'll get this conversation we're having, you'll get everything."}, {"time": 4345, "text":

microprocessors."}, {"time": 5662, "text": "So one of these big, you know, large format printers with high resolution and so on."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "So okay, so print this out lots of very tiny cells."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "And so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "And so it was very much a physical, you know, on the floor with meter rules trying to measure different things."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "So, so Feynman kind of takes me aside, we've been doing that for a little while and takes me aside."}, {"time": 5695, "text":

computation interesting."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "And I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "I mean, that intuition, you know, the difficulty of discovering things, like even you say, Oh, you know, you just enumerate all the cases and just find one that does something interesting, right?"}, {"time": 5772, "text": "Sounds very easy."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it, because I had kind of an intuition that said it shouldn't be there."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "So I had kind of arguments, Oh, I'm going to ignore that case, because whatever."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And how did you have an open mind enough?"}, {"time": 5786, "text": "Because you're essentially the same person as you should

complexity?"}, {"time": 5804, "text": "MG Yeah, I think that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I've wondered about that myself, because it's kind of like, you know, you live through these things, and then you say, what was the historical story?"}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact was not what you lived through, so to speak."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "And so, you know, what I realized is, I think what happened is, you know, I did physics, kind of like reductionistic physics, where you're thrown in the universe, and you're told, go figure out what's going on inside it."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "And then I started building computer tools."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And I started building my first computer language, for example."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And computer language is not like, it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations people want to do, and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "But then you do something that's really different, because you're just saying, okay, these are the primitives."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "Now, you know, hopefully they'll be useful to people, let's build up from there."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "So you're essentially building an artificial universe, in a sense, where you make this language, you've got these primitives, you're just building whatever you feel like building."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And so it was sort of interesting for me, because from doing science, where you're just thrown in the universe as the universe is, to then just being told, you know, you can make up any universe you want."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "And so I think that experience of making a computer language, which is essentially building your own universe, so to speak, that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "It's like, let's just explore what can be done in these artificial universes, rather than thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Yeah, by being able to program, essentially, you've, as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen, you now have, you've basically built another brain that you can use to explore the universe by computer program, you know, this is kind of a brain, right?"}, {"time": 5920, "text": "And it's well, it's it's or telescope, or you know,

romanticize the notion, but it's more general, the computer is more general."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "And it's, it's, I think, I mean, this point about, you know, people say, oh, such and such a

what's going on."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "That's really hard."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "And, you know, I think, in I've been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building computational language."}, {"time": 5964, "text": "And that's an activity that, in a sense, works by sort of having to kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "But, you know, it's, it's always I mean, I'm fully aware of, I suppose, the fact that I have seen it a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious, so to speak, that at least is factored into my attempt to not miss the obvious, although it may not succeed."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "What do you think is the role of ego in the history of math and science?"}, {"time": 5999, "text": "And more sort of, you know, a book title is something like a new kind of science."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "You've accomplished a huge amount."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "In fact, somebody said that Newton didn't have an ego, and I looked into it and he had a huge ego."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "Yeah, but from an outsider's perspective, some have said

in a tech company."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "And, you know, that is a, I think it's actually very, it means that one's ego is not a distant thing."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "It's a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak, because it's, it's all tied up with leadership and with how one, you know, develops an organization and all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "So, you know, it may be that if I'd been an academic, for example, I could have sort of, you know, check the ego, put it on, put on a shelf somewhere and ignore its characteristics, but you're reminded of it

intimately tied to ego."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "Now, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 6082, "text": "I mean, what, what is the, you know, for me, I've been fortunate that I think I have reasonable intellectual confidence, so to speak."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "That is, you know, I, I'm one of these people who at this point, if somebody tells me something and I just don't understand it, my conclusion isn't that means I'm dumb."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "That my conclusion is there's something wrong with what I'm being told."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And that was actually Dick Feynman

confronted with the fact that doesn't fit the thing that you've really thought through sort of both the negative and the positive of ego, do you see the negative of that get in the way sort of being

try doing this myself."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "Uh, if one does not have a certain degree of intellectual confidence, one just says, well, people have been trying to do this for a hundred years."},

on."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "Let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied in programs as a sort of generalization of the ones that can exist in mathematics as a way to describe the world."},

computing pi, it's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, very well defined."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "But yet, once you've generated those digits, they seem for all practical purposes completely random."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "And so it is with rule 30, that even though the rule is very simple, much simpler, much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi, even with a rule that simple, you're still generating immensely complicated behavior."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "So if we could just pause on that, I think you probably have said it and looked at it so long, you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don't, you still feel the magic."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "But to me, if you've never seen sort of, I would say, what is it?"}, {"time": 6703, "text": "A one dimensional, essentially, cellular automata, right?"}, {"time": 6709, "text": "And you were to guess what you would see if you have some sort of cells that only

complexity, you mentioned rule 30, still your favorite cellular automaton?"}, {"time": 6742, "text": "Still my favorite rule."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "You get complexity, immense complexity, you get arbitrary complexity."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "And when you say randomness down the middle column, that's just one cool way to say that there's incredible complexity."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And

the way?"}, {"time": 6848, "text": "Oh, well, I was just generating here."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "I'll actually generate a rule 30 pattern."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "So that's the rule for, for rule 30."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And it says, for example, it says here, if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right, then the cell on the next

with this kind of idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions as being sort of the underlying stuff from which computation would be built."}, {"time": 8289, "text": "And that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language."}, {"time": 8289, "text": "And operationally, what happens, it's, I would say, by far the highest level computer language that exists."}, {"time": 8296, "text":

really is kind of wrapped around the operations that a computer intrinsically does."}, {"time": 8314, "text": "Maybe people add libraries for this or that, but the goal of Wolfram language is to have

those efforts were too modest."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "That is they were, they were looking at particular areas and you actually can't do it with a particular area."}, {"time": 8646, "text": "I

relationship between what we've tried to do and sort of the learning side of, of AI."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "You know, in a sense, if you look at the development of knowledge in our civilization as

{"time": 8688, "text": "You can do things which are just use raw human thought."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "And then along came sort of modern mathematical science."}, {"time": 8694, "text": "And we

8706, "text": "And so that was kind of a different thing."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "So, so when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out, one way we could do it is start from scratch, learn everything."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "It's just a neural net figuring everything out."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge based

tried to do."}, {"time": 8739, "text": "And we're not saying just, you don't have to start everything from scratch."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "So in a sense, a big part of what we've done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world in computational form and computable form."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "Now there's also some pieces which, which were for a long time, undoable by computers like image identification, where there's a really, really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were pretty easy for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "I think the thing that's interesting, that's emerging now is the interplay between these things, between this kind of knowledge of the world that is in a sense, very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and so on."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "And putting those together by having this sort of symbolic representation of image identification, that that's where things get really interesting and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "I think that's, you know, that's kind of a part of the path forward, so to speak."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "So the dream of, so the machine learning is not in my view, I think the view of many people is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge that will from language of build."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "But because you have a kind of, you've done the incredibly hard work of building this world, now machine learning can be, can serve as tools to help you explore that world."}, {"time": 8831, "text": "And that's what you've added."}, {"time": 8831, "text": "I mean, with the version 12, right?"}, {"time": 8831, "text": "You added a few, I was seeing some demos, it looks amazing."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "I mean, I think, you know, this, it's sort of interesting to see the, the sort of the, once it's computable, once it's in there, it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way."}, {"time": 8850, "text": "But then there's sort of things like the interface of how do you get there?"}, {"time": 8850, "text": "You know, how do you do natural language understanding to get there?"}, {"time": 8854, "text": "How do you, how do you pick out entities in a big piece of text or something?"}, {"time": 8858, "text": "That's I mean, actually a good example right now is our NLP NLU loop, which is we've done a lot of stuff, natural language understanding using essentially not learning based methods, using a lot of, you know, little algorithmic methods, human curation methods and so on."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "In terms of when people try to enter a query and then converting."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "So the process of converting NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into a computational language, which is a very well, first of all, super practical definition, very useful definition, and then also a very clear definition of natural language understanding."}, {"time": 8901, "text": "I mean, a different thing is natural language processing, where it's like, here's a big lump of text, go pick out all the cities in that text, for example."}, {"time": 8910, "text": "And so a good example of, you know, so we do that, we're using, using modern machine learning techniques."}, {"time": 8915, "text": "And it's actually kind of, kind of an interesting process that's going on right now."}, {"time": 8920, "text": "It's this loop between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding."}, {"time": 8931, "text": "And so we've got this kind of loop going between those, which is improving both of them."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "And I think you have some of the state of the art transformers, like you have BERT in there, I think."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "So it's closely, you have, you have integrating all the models."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "I mean, this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about or talking about."}, {"time": 8947, "text": "I'm actually just surprised, frankly, that Wolfram language is not more popular than it already is."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "You know, that's a, it's a, it's a complicated issue because it's like, it involves, you know, it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed slowly in the world."}, {"time": 8964, "text": "I mean, I think that's And then there's sort of like what we're talking about, there's egos and personalities and some of the, the absorption, absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of personalities and the, and then a little social network."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So it's, it's interesting how the spread of ideas works."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "You know, what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are, if you say, you know, what market sort of market penetration, if you look at the, I would say very high end of R&D and sort of the, the people where you say, wow, that's a really impressive, smart person."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "They're very often users of Wolfram language, very, very often."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "If you look at the more sort of, it's a funny thing."}, {"time": 9012, "text": "If you look at the more kind of, I would say people who are like, oh, we're just plodding away doing what we do."}, {"time": 9016, "text": "They're often not yet Wolfram language users."}, {"time": 9016, "text": "And that dynamic, it's kind of odd that there hasn't been more rapid trickle down because we really, you know, the high end we've really been very successful in for a long time."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And it's, it's, but with, you know, that's partly, I think, a consequence of my fault in a sense, because it's kind of, you know, I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the best possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out in sort of the most effective way."}, {"time": 9059, "text": "And there's an interesting idea that, you know, perhaps you can make it more popular by opening everything up, sort of the GitHub model."}, {"time": 9063, "text": "But there's an interesting, I think I've heard you discuss this, that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases, like in this particular case, that you want it, that when you deeply care about the integrity, the quality of the knowledge that you're building, that, unfortunately, you can't, you can't distribute that effort."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "Yeah, it's not the nature of how things work."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "I mean, you know, what we're trying to do is a thing that for better or worse, requires leadership."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "And it requires kind of maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time, and doing not only the cool vision related work, but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually work well, work."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "So how do you build the knowledge?"}, {"time": 9113, "text": "Because that's the fascinating thing."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "That's the mundane, the fascinating and the mundane is building the knowledge, the adding, integrating more data."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's probably not the most, I mean, the things like get it to work in all these different cloud environments and so on."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "That's pretty, you know, it's very practical stuff, you know, have the user interface be smooth and, you know, have there be take only a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that."}, {"time": 9137, "text": "That's a lot of work."}, {"time": 9137, "text": "And it's, it's, but, you know, I think my, it's an interesting thing over the period of time, you know, often language has existed, basically, for more than half of the total amount of time that any language, any computer language has existed."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "That is, computer language is maybe 60 years old, you know, give or take, and often language is 33 years old."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "So it's, it's kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently, there's been more innovation in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure of programming languages over that period of time."}, {"time": 9174, "text": "And we, you know, we've been sort of trying to do our best to adapt to it."}, {"time": 9180, "text": "And the good news is that we have, you know, because I have a simple private company and so on that doesn't have, you know, a bunch of investors, you know, telling us we've got to do this so that they have lots of freedom in what we can do."}, {"time": 9189, "text": "And so, for example, we're able to, oh, I don't know, we have this free Wolfram engine for developers, which is a free version for developers."}, {"time": 9198, "text": "And we've been, you know, we've, there are site licenses for, for Mathematica and Wolfram language at basically all major universities, certainly in the US by now."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "So it's effectively free to people and all universities in effect."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "And, you know, we've been doing a progression of things."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "I mean, different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example, the main website is just a free website."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "What is Wolfram Alpha?"}, {"time": 9221, "text": "Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for answering questions where you ask a question with natural language, and it'll try and generate a report telling you the answer to that question."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "So the question could be something like, you know, what's the population of Boston divided by New York compared to New York?"}, {"time": 9239, "text": "And it'll take those words and give you an answer."}, {"time": 9246, "text": "And that converts the words into computable, into Wolfram language, into Wolfram language and computational language."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And then do you think the underlying knowledge belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram

decades to collect all that stuff."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "And, you know, more of it flows in every second."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "So can you, can you just pause on that for a second?"}, {"time": 9274, "text": "Like, that's one of the most incredible things, of course, in the long term, Wolfram language itself is the fundamental thing."}, {"time": 9280, "text": "But in the amazing sort of short term, the knowledge base is kind of incredible."}, {"time": 9286, "text": "So what's the process of building that knowledge base?"}, {"time": 9286, "text": "The fact that you, first of all, from the very beginning, that you're brave enough to start to take on the general knowledge base."}, {"time": 9297, "text": "And how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that you have now?"}, {"time": 9306, "text": "Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at some level."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "I mean, I had, I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid."},

assumed that to build something like Wolfram Alpha would require sort of solving the general AI problem."}, {"time": 9338, "text": "That's what I had assumed."}, {"time": 9344, "text": "And so I kept on thinking about that and I thought, I don't really know how to do that."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "So I don't do anything."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "Then I worked on my new kind of science project and sort of exploring the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence, which say there is no bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "So I thought, look, that's this paradigm I've built."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "You know, now it's, you know, now I have to eat that dog food myself, so to speak."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "You know, I've been thinking about doing this thing with computable knowledge forever and, you know, let me actually try and do it."}, {"time": 9376, "text": "And so it was, you know, if my paradigm is right, then this should be possible."}, {"time": 9381, "text": "But the beginning was certainly, you know, it was a bit daunting."}, {"time": 9381, "text": "I remember I took the early team to a big reference library and we're like looking at this reference library and it's like, you know, my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything that's in here."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "And that's, you know, it seemed very daunting, but in a sense, I was well aware of the fact that it's finite."}, {"time": 9403, "text":

not an infinite, you know, it's not the infinite corridor of, so to speak, of reference library."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "It's not truly infinite, so to speak."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "But no, I mean, and then what happened was sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn't start off saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "It was like, let's, you know, implement this area, this area, this area, a few hundred areas and so on."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "I also found that, you know, I've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the world's experts in lots of areas."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "And so that really helped because we were able to ask people, you know, the world expert in this or that, and we're able to ask them for input and so on."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "And I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who helped us figure out what to do wouldn't be right."}, {"time": 9466, "text": "You know, because our goal was to kind of get to the point where we had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "And so that, you know, the ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge in our civilization, make it be automatic to be able to answer that question."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "And, you know, and now, well, Wolfman got used in Siri from the very beginning, and it's now also used in Alexa."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "And so it's people are kind of getting more of the, you know, they get more of the sense of this is what should be possible to do."}, {"time": 9499, "text": "I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time."}, {"time": 9504, "text": "And I had kind of an interesting experience."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "I had a friend, Marvin Minsky, who was a well

level AI."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "So I don't think there's like one golden algorithm, or one golden design that can work."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And I mean, flying machines is the much worn

aerodynamics."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And that's what Marcus Hutter was trying to make with the AXI and his general theory of general intelligence."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "But that theory in its most clearly articulated parts really only works for either infinitely powerful machines or almost, or insanely impractically powerful machines."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "So I mean, if you were gonna take a theory based approach to AGI, what you would do is say, well, let's take what's called say AXE TL, which is Hutter's AXE machine that can work on merely insanely much processing power rather

"Like constrained somehow."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "So how AXE works basically is each action that it wants to take, before taking that action, it looks at all its history."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "And then it looks at all possible programs that it could use to make a decision."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "And it decides like which decision program would have let it make the best decisions according to its reward function over its history."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "And it uses that decision program to make the next decision, right?"}, {"time": 4502, "text": "It's not afraid of infinite resources."}, {"time": 4504, "text": "It's searching through the space of all possible computer programs in between each action and each next action."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "Now, AXE TL searches through all possible computer programs that have runtime less than T and length less than L.

these things have obvious potential, but I haven't yet put my hands on a system that seemed to manifest that."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "Mark's system should be amazing, but the current systems have not been great."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "Now, what's been done so far is not like that."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "So I guess personally, as a researcher, I mean, I've done a bunch of work in computational neuroscience where I did some work with IARPA in DC, Intelligence Advanced Research Project Agency."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "We were looking at how do you make a biologically realistic simulation of seven different parts of the brain cooperating with each other, using like realistic nonlinear dynamical models of neurons, and how do you get that to simulate what's going on in the mind of a geo intelligence analyst while they're trying to find terrorists on a map, right?"}, {"time": 6507, "text": "So if you want to do something like that, having neuromorphic hardware that really let you simulate like a realistic model of the neuron would be amazing."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "But that's sort of with my computational neuroscience hat on, right?"}, {"time": 6523, "text": "With an AGI hat on, I'm just more interested in these hypergraph knowledge representation based architectures, which would benefit more from various types of graph processors because the main processing bottleneck is reading writing to RAM."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "It's reading writing to the graph in RAM."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "The main processing bottleneck for this kind of proto AGI architecture is not multiplying matrices."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And for that reason, GPUs, which are really good at multiplying matrices, don't apply as well."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "There are frameworks like Gunrock and others that try to boil down graph processing to matrix operations, and they're cool, but you're still putting a square peg into a round hole in a certain way."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "The same is true, I mean, current quantum machine learning, which is very cool."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "It's also all about how to get matrix and vector operations in quantum mechanics, and I see why that's natural to do."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "I mean, quantum mechanics is all unitary matrices and vectors, right?"}, {"time": 6585, "text": "On the other hand, you could also try to make graph centric quantum computers, which I think is where things will go."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "And then we can have, then we can make, like take the open cog implementation layer, implement it in a collapsed state inside a quantum computer."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "But that may be the singularity squared, right?"}, {"time": 6606, "text": "I'm not sure we need that to get to human level."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "That's already beyond the first singularity."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "But can we just go back to open cog?"}, {"time": 6617, "text": "Yeah, and the hypergraph and open cog."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "That's the software framework, right?"}, {"time": 6621, "text": "So the next thing is our cognitive architecture tells us particular algorithms to put there."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "Can we backtrack on the kind of, is this graph designed, is it in general supposed to be sparse and the operations constantly grow and change the graph?"}, {"time": 6640, "text": "Yeah, the graph is sparse."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "But is it constantly adding links and so on?"}, {"time": 6645, "text": "It is a self modifying hypergraph."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "So it's not, so the write and read operations you're referring to, this isn't just a fixed graph to which you change the way, it's a constantly growing graph."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "So it is different model than, say current deep neural nets and have a fixed neural architecture and you're updating the weights."}, {"time": 6668, "text": "Although there have been like cascade correlational neural net architectures that grow new nodes and links, but the most common neural architectures now have a fixed neural architecture, you're updating the weights."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "And then open cog, you can update the weights and that certainly happens a lot, but adding new nodes, adding new links, removing nodes and links is an equally critical part of the system's operations."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "So now when you start to add these cognitive algorithms on top of this open cog architecture, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 6701, "text": "Yeah, so within this framework then, creating a cognitive architecture is basically two things."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "It's choosing what type system you wanna put on the nodes and links in the hypergraph, what types of nodes and links you want."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And then it's choosing what collection of agents, what collection of AI algorithms or processes are gonna run to operate on this hypergraph."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "And of course those two decisions are closely connected to each other."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "So in terms of the type system, there are some links that are more neural net like, they're just like have weights to get updated by heavy and learning and activation spreads along them."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "There are other links that are more logic like and nodes that are more logic like."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "So you could have a variable node and you can have a node representing a universal or existential quantifier as in predicate logic or term logic."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "So you can have logic like nodes and links, or you can have neural like nodes and links."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "You can also have procedure like nodes and links as in say a combinatorial logic or Lambda calculus representing programs."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So you can have nodes and links representing many different types of semantics, which means you could make a horrible ugly mess or you could make a system where these different types of knowledge all interpenetrate and synergize with each other beautifully, right?"}, {"time": 6788, "text": "So the hypergraph can contain programs."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "Yeah, it can contain programs, although in the current version, it is a very inefficient way to guide the execution of programs, which is one thing that we are aiming to resolve with our rewrite of the system now."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "So what to you is the most beautiful aspect of OpenCog?"}, {"time": 6812, "text": "Just to you personally, some aspect that captivates your imagination from beauty or power?"}, {"time": 6822, "text": "What fascinates me is finding a common representation that underlies abstract, declarative knowledge and sensory knowledge and movement knowledge and procedural knowledge and episodic knowledge, finding the right level of representation where all these types of knowledge are stored in a sort of universal and interconvertible yet practically manipulable way, right?"}, {"time": 6853, "text": "So to me, that's the core, because once you've done that, then the different learning algorithms can help each other out."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "But that can only be done if the intermediate state of a logic engine, the evolutionary learning engine, and a deep neural net are represented in the same form."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "And that's what we figured out how to do by putting the right type system on top of this weighted labeled hypergraph."}, {"time": 6917, "text": "So is there, can you maybe elaborate on what are the different characteristics of a type system that can coexist amongst all these different kinds of knowledge that needs to be represented?"}, {"time": 6930, "text": "And is, I mean, like, is it hierarchical?"}, {"time": 6934, "text": "Just any kind of insights you can give on that kind of type system?"}, {"time": 6937, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so this gets very nitty gritty and mathematical, of course, but one key part is switching from predicate logic to term logic."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "What is predicate logic?"}, {"time": 6951, "text": "What is term logic?"}, {"time": 6953, "text": "So term logic was invented by Aristotle, or at least that's the oldest recollection we have of it."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "But term logic breaks down basic logic into basically simple links between nodes, like an inheritance link between node A and node B."}, {"time": 6972, "text": "So in term logic, the basic deduction operation is A implies B, B implies C, therefore A implies C. Whereas in predicate logic, the basic operation is modus ponens, like A implies B, therefore B."}, {"time": 6987, "text": "So it's a slightly different way of breaking down logic, but by breaking down logic into term logic, you get a nice way of breaking logic down into nodes and links."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "So your concepts can become nodes, the logical relations become links."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "And so then inference is like, so if this link is A implies B, this link is B implies C, then deduction builds a link A implies C. And your probabilistic algorithm can assign a certain weight there."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "Now, you may also have like a Hebbian neural link from A to C, which is the degree to which thinking, the degree to which A being the focus of attention should make B the focus of attention, right?"}, {"time": 7029, "text": "So you could have then a neural link and you could have a symbolic, like logical inheritance link in your term logic."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "And they have separate meaning, but they could be used to guide each other as well."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "Like if there's a large amount of neural weight on the link between A and B, that may direct your logic engine to think about, well, what is the relation?"}, {"time": 7051, "text": "Are they similar?"}, {"time": 7052, "text": "Is there an inheritance relation?"}, {"time": 7053, "text": "Are they similar in some context?"}, {"time": 7057, "text": "On the other hand, if there's a logical relation between A and B, that may direct your neural component to think, well, when I'm thinking about A, should I be directing some attention to B also?"}, {"time": 7068, "text": "Because there's a logical relation."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "So in terms of logic, there's a lot of thought that went into how do you break down logic relations, including basic sort of propositional logic relations as Aristotelian term logic deals with, and then quantifier logic relations also."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "How do you break those down elegantly into a hypergraph?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "Because you, I mean, you can boil logic expression into a graph in many different ways."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "Many of them are very ugly, right?"}, {"time": 7096, "text": "We tried to find elegant ways of sort of hierarchically breaking down complex logic expression into nodes and links."}, {"time": 7106, "text": "So that if you have say different nodes representing, Ben, AI, Lex, interview or whatever, the logic relations between those things are compact in the node and link representation."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "So that when you have a neural net acting on the same nodes and links, the neural net and the logic engine can sort of interoperate with each other."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "And also interpretable by humans."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "Is that an important?"}, {"time": 7131, "text": "That's tough."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "Yeah, in simple cases, it's interpretable by humans."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "But honestly, I would say logic systems I would say logic systems give more potential for transparency and comprehensibility than neural net systems, but you still have to work at it."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "Because I mean, if I show you a predicate logic proposition with like 500 nested universal and existential quantifiers and 217 variables, that's no more comprehensible than the weight metrics of a neural network, right?"}, {"time": 7166, "text": "So I'd say the logic expressions that AI learns from its experience are mostly totally opaque to human beings and maybe even harder to understand than neural net."}, {"time": 7176, "text": "Because I mean, when you have multiple nested quantifier bindings, it's a very high level of abstraction."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "There is a difference though, in that within logic, it's a little more straightforward to pose the problem of like normalize this and boil this down to a certain form."}, {"time": 7191, "text": "I mean, you can do that in neural nets too."}, {"time": 7192, "text": "Like you can distill a neural net to a simpler form, but that's more often done to make a neural net that'll run on an embedded device or something."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "It's harder to distill a net to a comprehensible form than it is to simplify a logic expression to a comprehensible form, but it doesn't come for free."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "Like what's in the AI's mind is incomprehensible to a human unless you do some special work to make it comprehensible."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "So on the procedural side, there's some different and sort of interesting voodoo there."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "I mean, if you're familiar in computer science, there's something called the Curry Howard correspondence, which is a one to one mapping between proofs and programs."}, {"time": 7230, "text": "So every program can be mapped into a proof."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "Every proof can be mapped into a program."}, {"time": 7235, "text": "You can model this using category theory and a bunch of nice math, but we wanna make that practical, right?"}, {"time": 7243, "text": "So that if you have an executable program that like moves the robot's arm or figures out in what order to say things in a dialogue, that's a procedure represented in OpenCog's hypergraph."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "But if you wanna reason on how to improve that procedure, you need to map that procedure into logic using Curry Howard isomorphism."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "So then the logic engine can reason about how to improve that procedure and then map that back into the procedural representation that is efficient for execution."}, {"time": 7276, "text": "So again, that comes down to not just can you make your procedure into a bunch of nodes and links?"}, {"time": 7281, "text": "Cause I mean, that can be done trivially."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "A C++ compiler has nodes and links inside it."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "Can you boil down your procedure into a bunch of nodes and links in a way that's like hierarchically decomposed and simple enough?"}, {"time": 7293, "text": "It can reason about."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "Yeah, yeah, that given the resource constraints at hand, you can map it back and forth to your term logic, like fast enough and without having a bloated logic expression, right?"}, {"time": 7305, "text": "So there's just a lot of, there's a lot of nitty gritty particulars there, but by the same token, if you ask a chip designer, like how do you make the Intel I7 chip so good?"}, {"time": 7318, "text": "There's a long list of technical answers there, which will take a while to go through, right?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "And this has been decades of work."}, {"time": 7326, "text": "I mean, the first AI system of this nature I tried to build was called WebMind in the mid 1990s."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "And we had a big graph, a big graph operating in RAM implemented with Java 1.1, which was a terrible, terrible implementation idea."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "And then each node had its own processing."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "So like that there, the core loop looped through all nodes in the network and let each node enact what its little thing was doing."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "And we had logic and neural nets in there, but an evolutionary learning, but we hadn't done enough of the math to get them to operate together very cleanly."}, {"time": 7363, "text": "So it was really, it was quite a horrible mess."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "So as well as shifting an implementation where the graph is its own object and the agents are separately scheduled, we've also done a lot of work on how do you represent programs?"}, {"time": 7378, "text": "How do you represent procedures?"}, {"time": 7380, "text": "You know, how do you represent genotypes for evolution in a way that the interoperability between the different types of learning associated with these different types of knowledge actually works?"}, {"time": 7393, "text": "And that's been quite difficult."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "It's taken decades and it's totally off to the side of what the commercial mainstream of the AI field is doing, which isn't thinking about representation at all really."}, {"time": 7407, "text": "Although you could see like in the DNC, they had to think a little bit about how do you make representation of a map in this memory matrix work together with the representation needed for say visual pattern recognition in the hierarchical neural network."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "But I would say we have taken that direction of taking the types of knowledge you need for different types of learning, like declarative, procedural, attentional, and how do you make these types of knowledge represent in a way that allows cross learning across these different types of memory."}, {"time": 7440, "text": "We've been prototyping and experimenting with this within OpenCog and before that WebMind since the mid 1990s."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "Now, disappointingly to all of us, this has not yet been cashed out in an AGI system, right?"}, {"time": 7458, "text": "I mean, we've used this system within our consulting business."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "So we've built natural language processing and robot control and financial analysis."}, {"time": 7467, "text": "We've built a bunch of sort of vertical market specific proprietary AI projects."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "They use OpenCog on the backend, but we haven't, that's not the AGI goal, right?"}, {"time": 7479, "text": "It's interesting, but it's not the AGI goal."}, {"time": 7482, "text": "So now what we're looking at with our rebuild of the system."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "2.0."}, {"time": 7489, "text": "Yeah, we're also calling it True AGI."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "So we're not quite sure what the name is yet."}, {"time": 7494, "text": "We made a website for trueagi.io, but we haven't put anything on there yet."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "We may come up with an even better name."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "It's kind of like the real AI starting point for your AGI book."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "Yeah, but I like True better because True has like, you can be true hearted, right?"}, {"time": 7509, "text": "You can be true to your girlfriend."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "So True has a number and it also has logic in it, right?"}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Because logic is a key part of the system."}, {"time": 7518, "text": "So yeah, with the True AGI system, we're sticking with the same basic architecture, but we're trying to build on what we've learned."}, {"time": 7529, "text": "And one thing we've learned is that, we need type checking among dependent types to be much faster and among probabilistic dependent types to be much faster."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "So as it is now, you can have complex types on the nodes and links."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "But if you wanna put, like if you want types to be first class citizens, so that you can have the types can be variables and then you do type checking among complex higher order types."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "You can do that in the system now, but it's very slow."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "This is stuff like it's done in cutting edge program languages like Agda or something, these obscure research languages."}, {"time": 7567, "text": "On the other hand, we've been doing a lot tying together deep neural nets with symbolic learning."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So we did a project for Cisco, for example, which was on, this was street scene analysis, but they had deep neural models for a bunch of cameras watching street scenes, but they trained a different model for each camera because they couldn't get the transfer learning to work between camera A and camera B."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "So we took what came out of all the deep neural models for the different cameras, we fed it into an open called symbolic representation."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "Then we did some pattern mining and some reasoning on what came out of all the different cameras within the symbolic graph."}, {"time": 7599, "text": "And that worked well for that application."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "I mean, Hugo Latapie from Cisco gave a talk touching on that at last year's AGI conference, it was in Shenzhen."}, {"time": 7608, "text": "On the other hand, we learned from there, it was kind of clunky to get the deep neural models to work well with the symbolic system because we were using torch."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And torch keeps a sort of state computation graph, but you needed like real time access to that computation graph within our hypergraph."}, {"time": 7627, "text": "And we certainly did it, Alexey Polopov who leads our St. Petersburg team wrote a great paper on cognitive modules in OpenCog explaining sort of how do you deal with the torch compute graph inside OpenCog."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "But in the end we realized like, that just hadn't been one of our design thoughts when we built OpenCog, right?"}, {"time": 7673, "text": "So these performance requirements are what have driven us to want to rearchitect the base, but the core AGI paradigm doesn't really change."}, {"time": 7685, "text": "Like the mathematics is the same."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "It's just, we can't scale to the level that we want in terms of distributed processing or speed of various kinds of processing with the current infrastructure that was built in the phase 2001 to 2008, which is hardly shocking."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "Well, I mean, the three things you mentioned are really interesting."}, {"time": 7708, "text": "So what do you think about in terms of interoperability communicating with computational graph of neural networks?"}, {"time": 7716, "text": "What do you think about the representations that neural networks form?"}, {"time": 7720, "text": "They're bad, but there's many ways that you could deal with that."}, {"time": 7724, "text": "So I've been wrestling with this a lot in some work on supervised grammar induction, and I have a simple paper on that."}, {"time": 7732, "text": "They'll give it the next AGI conference, online portion of which is next week, actually."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "What is grammar induction?"}, {"time": 7740, "text": "So this isn't AGI either, but it's sort of on the verge between narrow AI and AGI or something."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "Unsupervised grammar induction is the problem."}, {"time": 7751, "text": "Throw your AI system, a huge body of text, and have it learn the grammar of the language that produced that text."}, {"time": 7760, "text": "So you're not giving it labeled examples."}, {"time": 7762, "text": "So you're not giving it like a thousand sentences where the parses were marked up by graduate students."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "So it's just got to infer the grammar from the text."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "It's like the Rosetta Stone, but worse, right?"}, {"time": 7773, "text": "Because you only have the one language, and you have to figure out what is the grammar."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "So that's not really AGI because, I mean, the way a human learns language is not that, right?"}, {"time": 7784, "text": "I mean, we learn from language that's used in context."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "So it's a social embodied thing."}, {"time": 7789, "text": "We see how a given sentence is grounded in observation."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "There's an interactive element, I guess."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "On the other hand, so I'm more interested in that."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "I'm more interested in making an AGI system learn language from its social and embodied experience."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "On the other hand, that's also more of a pain to do, and that would lead us into Hanson Robotics and their robotics work I've known much."}, {"time": 7812, "text": "We'll talk about it in a few minutes."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "But just as an intellectual exercise, as a learning exercise, trying to learn grammar from a corpus is very, very interesting, right?"}, {"time": 7824, "text": "And that's been a field in AI for a long time."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "No one can do it very well."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "So we've been looking at transformer neural networks and tree transformers, which are amazing."},

eight or something."}, {"time": 7846, "text": "So it's been fun to see my former sort of AGI employees disperse and do all these amazing things."}, {"time": 7854, "text": "Way too many sucked into Google, actually."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "Well, yeah, anyway."}, {"time": 7857, "text": "We'll talk about that too."}, {"time": 7858, "text": "Lucas Kaiser and a bunch of these guys, they create transformer networks, that classic paper like attention is all you need and all these things following on from that."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "So we're looking at transformer networks."}, {"time": 7870, "text": "And like, these are able to, I mean, this is what underlies GPT2 and GPT3 and so on, which are very, very cool and have absolutely no cognitive understanding of any of the texts they're looking at."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "Like they're very intelligent idiots, right?"}, {"time": 7884, "text": "So sorry to take, but this small, I'll bring this back, but do you think GPT3 understands language?"}, {"time": 7891, "text": "No, no, it understands nothing."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "It's a complete idiot."}, {"time": 7895, "text": "But it's a brilliant idiot."}, {"time": 7896, "text":

see many highly valuable uses for them."}, {"time": 7917, "text": "And as an artist, I love them, right?"}, {"time": 7921, "text": "So I mean, we're using our own neural model, which is along those lines to control the Philip K.

patterns out of the structure of the transformer network."}, {"time": 7975, "text": "And you can, but the patterns aren't what you want."}, {"time": 7979, "text": "They're nasty."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "So I mean, if you do supervised learning, if you look at sentences where you know the correct parts of a sentence, you can learn a matrix that maps between the internal representation of the transformer and the parse of the sentence."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "And so then you can actually train something that will output the sentence parse from the transformer network's internal state."}, {"time": 8000, "text": "And we did this, I think Christopher Manning, some others have not done this also."}, {"time": 8008, "text": "But I mean, what you get is that the representation is hardly ugly and is scattered all over the network and doesn't look like the rules of grammar that you know are the right rules of grammar, right?"}, {"time": 8017, "text": "It's kind of ugly."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "So what we're actually doing is we're using a symbolic grammar learning algorithm, but we're using the transformer neural network as a sentence probability oracle."}, {"time": 8028, "text": "So like if you have a rule of grammar and you aren't sure if it's a correct rule of grammar or not, you can generate a bunch of sentences using that rule of grammar and a bunch of sentences violating that rule of grammar."}, {"time": 8040, "text": "And you can see the transformer model doesn't think the sentences obeying the rule of grammar are more probable than the sentences disobeying the rule of grammar."}, {"time": 8050, "text": "So in that way, you can use the neural model as a sense probability oracle to guide a symbolic grammar learning process."}, {"time": 8059, "text": "And that seems to work better than trying to milk the grammar out of the neural network that doesn't have it in there."}, {"time": 8066, "text": "So I think the thing is these neural nets are not getting a semantically meaningful representation internally by and large."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "So one line of research is to try to get them to do that."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "And InfoGAN was trying to do that."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "So like if you look back like two years ago, there was all these papers on like at Edward, this probabilistic programming neural net framework that Google had, which came out of InfoGAN."}, {"time": 8089, "text": "So the idea there was like you could train an InfoGAN neural net model, which is a generative associative network to recognize and generate faces."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "And the model would automatically learn a variable for how long the nose is and automatically learn a variable for how wide the eyes are or how big the lips are or something, right?"}, {"time": 8108, "text": "So it automatically learned these variables, which have a semantic meaning."}, {"time": 8112, "text": "So that was a rare case where a neural net trained with a fairly standard GAN method was able to actually learn the semantic representation."}, {"time": 8120, "text": "So for many years, many of us tried to take that the next step and get a GAN type neural network that would have not just a list of semantic latent variables, but would have say a Bayes net of semantic latent variables with dependencies between them."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "The whole programming framework Edward was made for that."}, {"time": 8138, "text": "I mean, no one got it to work, right?"}, {"time": 8140, "text": "And it could be."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "Yeah, do you think?"}, {"time": 8144, "text": "It might be that back propagation just won't work for it because the gradients are too screwed up."}, {"time": 8149, "text": "Maybe you could get it to work using CMAES or some like floating point evolutionary algorithm."}, {"time": 8154, "text": "We tried, we didn't get it to work."}, {"time": 8157, "text": "Eventually we just paused that rather than gave it up."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "We paused that and said, well, okay, let's try more innovative ways to learn implicit, to learn what are the representations implicit in that network without trying to make it grow inside that network."}, {"time": 8174, "text": "And I described how we're doing that in language."}, {"time": 8179, "text": "You can do similar things in vision, right?"}, {"time": 8182, "text": "Use it as an oracle."}, {"time": 8184, "text": "So you can, that's one way is that you use a structure learning algorithm, which is symbolic."}, {"time": 8189, "text": "And then you use the deep neural net as an oracle to guide the structure learning algorithm."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "The other way to do it is like Infogam was trying to do and try to tweak the neural network to have the symbolic representation inside it."}, {"time": 8203, "text": "I tend to think what the brain is doing is more like using the deep neural net type thing as an oracle."}, {"time": 8212, "text": "I think the visual cortex or the cerebellum are probably learning a non semantically meaningful opaque tangled representation."}, {"time": 8222, "text": "And then when they interface with the more cognitive parts of the cortex, the cortex is sort of using those as an oracle and learning the abstract representation."}, {"time": 8230, "text": "So if you do sports, say take for example, serving in tennis, right?"}, {"time": 8235, "text": "I mean, my tennis serve is okay, not great, but I learned it by trial and error, right?"}, {"time": 8239, "text": "And I mean, I learned music by trial and error too."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "I just sit down and play, but then if you're an athlete, which I'm not a good athlete, I mean, then you'll watch videos of yourself serving and your coach will help you think about what you're doing and you'll then form a declarative representation, but your cerebellum maybe didn't have a declarative representation."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "Same way with music, like I will hear something in my head, I'll sit down and play the thing like I heard it."}, {"time": 8266, "text": "And then I will try to study what my fingers did to see like, what did you just play?"}, {"time": 8272, "text": "Like how did you do that, right?"}, {"time": 8275, "text": "Because if you're composing, you may wanna see how you did it and then declaratively morph that in some way that your fingers wouldn't think of, right?"}, {"time": 8285, "text": "But the physiological movement may come out of some opaque, like cerebellar reinforcement learned thing, right?"}, {"time": 8294, "text": "And so that's, I think trying to milk the structure of a neural net by treating it as an oracle, maybe more like how your declarative mind post processes what your visual or motor cortex."}, {"time": 8307, "text": "I mean, in vision, it's the same way, like you can recognize beautiful art much better than you can say why you think that piece of art is beautiful."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "But if you're trained as an art critic, you do learn to say why."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "And some of it's bullshit, but some of it isn't, right?"}, {"time": 8324, "text": "Some of it is learning to map sensory knowledge into declarative and linguistic knowledge, yet without necessarily making the sensory system itself use a transparent and an easily communicable representation."}, {"time": 8340, "text": "Yeah, that's fascinating to think of neural networks as like dumb question answers that you can just milk to build up a knowledge base."}, {"time": 8350, "text": "And then it can be multiple networks, I suppose, from different."}, {"time": 8353, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so I think if a group like DeepMind or OpenAI were to build AGI, and I think DeepMind is like a thousand times more likely from what I could tell, because they've hired a lot of people with broad minds and many different approaches and angles on AGI, whereas OpenAI is also awesome, but I see them as more of like a pure deep reinforcement learning shop."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "Yeah, this time, I got you."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot of, you're right, I mean, there's so much interdisciplinary work at DeepMind, like neuroscience."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "And you put that together with Google Brain, which granted they're not working that closely together now, but my oldest son Zarathustra is doing his PhD in machine learning applied to automated theorem proving in Prague under Josef Urban."}, {"time": 8403, "text": "So the first paper, DeepMath, which applied deep neural nets to guide theorem proving was out of Google Brain."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "Take all of these and then wire them together to co train and learn them together like that."}, {"time": 8452, "text": "That would be an approach to creating an AGI."}, {"time": 8457, "text": "One could implement something like that efficiently on top of our true AGI, like OpenCog 2.0 system, once it exists, although obviously Google has their own highly efficient implementation architecture."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "So I think that's a decent way to build AGI."}, {"time": 8473, "text": "I was very interested in that in the mid 90s, but I mean, the knowledge about how the brain works sort of pissed me off, like it wasn't there yet."}, {"time": 8481, "text": "Like, you know, in the hippocampus, you have these concept neurons, like the so called grandmother neuron, which everyone laughed at it, it's actually there."}, {"time": 8488, "text": "Like I have some Lex Friedman neurons that fire differentially when I see you and not when I see any other person, right?"}, {"time": 8495, "text": "So how do these Lex Friedman neurons, how do they coordinate with the distributed representation of Lex Friedman I have in my cortex, right?"}, {"time": 8504, "text": "There's some back and forth between cortex and hippocampus that lets these discrete symbolic representations in hippocampus correlate and cooperate with the distributed representations in cortex."}, {"time": 8515, "text": "This probably has to do with how the brain does its version of abstraction and quantifier logic, right?"}, {"time": 8520, "text": "Like you can have a single neuron in the hippocampus that activates a whole distributed activation pattern in cortex, well, this may be how the brain does like symbolization and abstraction as in functional programming or something, but we can't measure it."}, {"time": 8535, "text": "Like we don't have enough electrodes stuck between the cortex and the hippocampus in any known experiment to measure it."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "So I got frustrated with that direction, not because it's impossible."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "Because we just don't understand enough yet."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "Of course, it's a valid research direction."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "You can try to understand more and more."}, {"time": 8553, "text": "And we are measuring more and more about what happens in the brain now than ever before."}, {"time": 8558, "text": "So it's quite interesting."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "On the other hand, I sort of got more of an engineering mindset about AGI."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "I'm like, well, okay, we don't know how the brain works that well."}, {"time": 8570, "text": "We don't know how birds fly that well yet either."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "We have no idea how a hummingbird flies in terms of the aerodynamics of it."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "On the other hand, we know basic principles of like flapping and pushing the air down."}, {"time": 8581, "text": "And we know the basic principles of how the different parts of the brain work."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "So let's take those basic principles and engineer something that embodies those basic principles, but is well designed for the hardware that we have on hand right now."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "So do you think we can create AGI before we understand how the brain works?"}, {"time": 8602, "text": "I think that's probably what will happen."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And maybe the AGI will help us do better brain imaging that will then let us build artificial humans, which is very, very interesting to us because we are humans, right?"}, {"time": 8614, "text": "I mean, building artificial humans is super worthwhile."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "I just think it's probably not the shortest path to AGI."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "So it's fascinating idea that we would build AGI to help us understand ourselves."}, {"time": 8630, "text": "A lot of people ask me if the young people interested in doing artificial intelligence, they look at sort of doing graduate level, even undergrads, but graduate level research and they see whether the artificial intelligence community stands now, it's not really AGI type research for the most part."}, {"time": 8649, "text": "So the natural question they ask is what advice would you give?"}, {"time": 8653, "text": "I mean, maybe I could ask if people were interested in working on OpenCog or in some kind of direct or indirect connection to OpenCog or AGI research, what would you recommend?"}, {"time": 8668, "text": "OpenCog, first of all, is open source project."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "There's a Google group discussion list."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "There's a GitHub repository."}, {"time": 8676, "text": "So if anyone's interested in lending a hand with that aspect of AGI, introduce yourself on the OpenCog email list."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "And there's a Slack as well."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "I mean, we're certainly interested to have inputs into our redesign process for a new version of OpenCog, but also we're doing a lot of very interesting research."}, {"time": 8701, "text": "I mean, we're working on data analysis for COVID clinical trials."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "We're working with Hanson Robotics."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "We're doing a lot of cool things with the current version of OpenCog now."}, {"time": 8710, "text": "So there's certainly opportunity to jump into OpenCog or various other open source AGI oriented projects."}, {"time": 8718, "text": "So would you say there's like masters and PhD theses in there?"}, {"time": 8722, "text": "Plenty, yeah, plenty, of course."}, {"time": 8723, "text": "I mean, the challenge is to find a supervisor who wants to foster that sort of research, but it's way easier than it was when I got my PhD, right?"}, {"time": 8732, "text": "It's okay, great."}, {"time": 8733, "text": "We talked about OpenCog, which is kind of one, the software framework, but also the actual attempt to build an AGI system."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "And then there is this exciting idea of SingularityNet."}, {"time": 8748, "text": "So maybe can you say first what is SingularityNet?"}, {"time": 8754, "text": "SingularityNet is a platform for realizing a decentralized network of artificial intelligences."}, {"time": 8768, "text": "So Marvin Minsky, the AI pioneer who I knew a little bit, he had the idea of a society of minds, like you should achieve an AI not by writing one algorithm or one program, but you should put a bunch of different AIs out there and the different AIs will interact with each other, each playing their own role."}, {"time": 8789, "text": "And then the totality of the society of AIs would be the thing that displayed the human level intelligence."}, {"time": 8796, "text": "And I had, when he was alive, I had many debates with Marvin about this idea."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "And I think he really thought the mind was more like a society than I do."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "Like I think you could have a mind that was as disorganized as a human society, but I think a human like mind has a bit more central control than that actually."}, {"time": 8820, "text": "Like, I mean, we have this thalamus and the medulla and limbic system."}, {"time": 8824, "text": "We have a sort of top down control system that guides much of what we do, more so than a society does."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "So I think he stretched that metaphor a little too far, but I also think there's something interesting there."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "And so in the 90s, when I started my first sort of nonacademic AI project, WebMind, which was an AI startup in New York in the Silicon Alley area in the late 90s, what I was aiming to do there was make a distributed society of AIs, the different parts of which would live on different computers all around the world."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "And each one would do its own thinking about the data local to it, but they would all share information with each other and outsource work with each other and cooperate."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "And the intelligence would be in the whole collective."}, {"time": 8874, "text": "And I organized a conference together with Francis Heiligen at Free University of Brussels in 2001, which was the Global Brain Zero Conference."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "And we're planning the next version, the Global Brain One Conference at the Free University of Brussels for next year, 2021."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "So 20 years after."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "And then maybe we can have the next one 10 years after that, like exponentially faster until the singularity comes, right?"}, {"time": 8899, "text": "The timing is right, yeah."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "So yeah, the idea with the Global Brain was maybe the AI won't just be in a program on one guy's computer, but the AI will be in the internet as a whole with the cooperation of different AI modules living in different places."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "So one of the issues you face when architecting a system like that is, you know, how is the whole thing controlled?"}, {"time": 8924, "text": "Do you have like a centralized control unit that pulls the puppet strings of all the different modules there?"}, {"time": 8930, "text": "Or do you have a fundamentally decentralized network where the society of AIs is controlled in some democratic and self organized way, but all the AIs in that society, right?"}, {"time": 8944, "text": "And Francis and I had different view of many things, but we both wanted to make like a global society of AI minds with a decentralized organizational mode."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "Now, the main difference was he wanted the individual AIs to be all incredibly simple and all the intelligence to be on the collective level."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "Whereas I thought that was cool, but I thought a more practical way to do it might be if some of the agents in the society of minds were fairly generally intelligent on their own."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "So like you could have a bunch of open cogs out there and a bunch of simpler learning systems."}, {"time": 8987, "text": "And then these are all cooperating, coordinating together sort of like in the brain."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "Okay, the brain as a whole is the general intelligence, but some parts of the cortex, you could say have a fair bit of general intelligence on their own, whereas say parts of the cerebellum or limbic system have very little general intelligence on their own."}, {"time": 9004, "text": "And they're contributing to general intelligence by way of their connectivity to other modules."}, {"time": 9010, "text": "Do you see instantiations of the same kind of, maybe different versions of open cog, but also just the same version of open cog and maybe many instantiations of it as being all parts of it?"}, {"time": 9021, "text": "That's what David and Hans and I want to do with many Sophia and other robots."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "Each one has its own individual mind living on the server, but there's also a collective intelligence infusing them and a part of the mind living on the edge in each robot."}, {"time": 9035, "text": "So the thing is at that time, as well as WebMind being implemented in Java 1.1 as like a massive distributed system, blockchain wasn't there yet."}, {"time": 9048, "text": "So had them do this decentralized control."}, {"time": 9051, "text": "We sort of knew it."}, {"time": 9052, "text": "We knew about distributed systems."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "We knew about encryption."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "So I mean, we had the key principles of what underlies blockchain now, but I mean, we didn't put it together in the way that it's been done now."}, {"time": 9062, "text": "So when Vitalik Buterin and colleagues came out with Ethereum blockchain, many, many years later, like 2013 or something, then I was like, well, this is interesting."}, {"time": 9073, "text": "Like this is solidity scripting language."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "It's kind of dorky in a way."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "And I don't see why you need to turn complete language for this purpose."}, {"time": 9082, "text": "But on the other hand, this is like the first time I could sit down and start to like script infrastructure for decentralized control of the AIs in this society of minds in a tractable way."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "Like you can hack the Bitcoin code base, but it's really annoying."}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Whereas solidity is Ethereum scripting language is just nicer and easier to use."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "I'm very annoyed with it by this point."}, {"time": 9105, "text": "But like Java, I mean, these languages are amazing when they first come out."}, {"time": 9110, "text": "So then I came up with the idea that turned into SingularityNet."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "Okay, let's make a decentralized agent system where a bunch of different AIs, wrapped up in say different Docker containers or LXC containers, different AIs can each of them have their own identity on the blockchain."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "And the coordination of this community of AIs has no central controller, no dictator, right?"}, {"time": 9134, "text": "And there's no central repository of information."}, {"time": 9137, "text": "The coordination of the society of minds is done entirely by the decentralized network in a decentralized way by the algorithms, right?"}, {"time": 9145, "text": "Because the model of Bitcoin is in math we trust, right?"}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And so that's what you need."}, {"time": 9150, "text": "You need the society of minds to trust only in math, not trust only in one centralized server."}, {"time": 9157, "text": "So the AI systems themselves are outside of the blockchain, but then the communication between them."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "At the moment, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "I would have loved to put the AI's operations on chain in some sense, but in Ethereum, it's just too slow."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "You can't do it."}, {"time": 9172, "text": "Somehow it's the basic communication between AI systems."}, {"time": 9176, "text": "That's the distribution."}, {"time": 9178, "text": "Basically an AI is just some software in singularity."}, {"time": 9182, "text": "An AI is just some software process living in a container."}, {"time": 9185, "text": "And there's a proxy that lives in that container along with the AI that handles the interaction with the rest of singularity net."}, {"time": 9193, "text": "And then when one AI wants to contribute with another one in the network, they set up a number of channels."}, {"time": 9198, "text": "And the setup of those channels uses the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 9202, "text": "Once the channels are set up, then data flows along those channels without having to be on the blockchain."}, {"time": 9209, "text": "All that goes on the blockchain is the fact that some data went along that channel."}, {"time": 9213, "text": "So you can do..."}, {"time": 9214, "text": "So there's not a shared knowledge."}, {"time": 9218, "text": "Well, the identity of each agent is on the blockchain, on the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "If one agent rates the reputation of another agent, that goes on the blockchain."}, {"time": 9229, "text": "And agents can publish what APIs they will fulfill on the blockchain."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "But the actual data for AI and the results for AI is not on the blockchain."},

cases, maybe it shouldn't be."}, {"time": 9245, "text": "But I mean, I think that..."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "So I'll give you an example."}, {"time": 9250, "text": "Using Ethereum, you can't do it."}, {"time": 9251, "text": "Using now, there's more modern and faster blockchains where you could start to do that in some cases."}, {"time": 9261, "text": "Two years ago, that was less so."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "It's a very rapidly evolving ecosystem."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "So like one example, maybe you can comment on something I worked a lot on is autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "You can see each individual vehicle as an AI system."}, {"time": 9275, "text": "And you can see vehicles from Tesla, for example, and then Ford and GM and all these as also like larger..."}, {"time": 9284, "text": "I mean, they all are running the same kind of system on each sets of vehicles."}, {"time": 9289, "text": "So it's individual AI systems and individual vehicles, but it's all different."}, {"time": 9293, "text": "The station is the same AI system within the same company."}, {"time": 9297, "text": "So you can envision a situation where all of those AI systems are put on SingularityNet, right?"}, {"time": 9305, "text": "And how do you see that happening?"}, {"time": 9310, "text": "And what would be the benefit?"}, {"time": 9311, "text": "And could they share data?"}, {"time": 9313, "text": "I guess one of the biggest things is that the power there's in a decentralized control, but the benefit would have been, is really nice if they can somehow share the knowledge in an open way if they choose to."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, those are all quite good points."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "So I think the benefit from being on the decentralized network as we envision it is that we want the AIs in the network to be outsourcing work to each other and making API calls to each other frequently."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "So the real benefit would be if that AI wanted to outsource some cognitive processing or data processing or data pre processing, whatever, to some other AIs in the network, which specialize in something different."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "And this really requires a different way of thinking about AI software development, right?"}, {"time": 9367, "text": "So just like object oriented programming was different than imperative programming."}, {"time": 9372, "text": "And now object oriented programmers all use these frameworks to do things rather than just libraries even."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "You know, shifting to agent based programming where AI agent is asking other like live real time evolving agents for feedback and what they're doing."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "That's a different way of thinking."}, {"time": 9391, "text": "I mean, it's not a new one."}, {"time": 9392, "text": "There was loads of papers on agent based programming in the 80s and onward."}, {"time": 9397, "text":

they're very major computer science challenges."}, {"time": 9512, "text": "And I think what you saw with the whole ICO boom in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world is a lot of young hackers who

hard it is."}, {"time": 9529, "text": "And it's like, actually we're wrestling with incredibly hard computer science and software engineering and distributed systems problems, which can be solved, but

have a network of machines inside a distributed OpenCog mind, but then that OpenCog will interface with other AIs doing deep neural nets or custom biology data analysis or whatever they're doing in

the human body."}, {"time": 9869, "text": "Like the brain has regions like cortex or hippocampus, which tightly interconnects like cortical columns within the cortex, for example."}, {"time": 9879,

have tutorials, but it's somewhat cognitively labor intensive to get up to speed on OpenCog."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "And I mean, what's one of the things we hope to change with the true AGI OpenCog

"text": "So I mean, if you're a command line guy, there's a command line interface."}, {"time": 9976, "text": "It's quite easy to take any AI that has an API and lives in a Docker container and put it online anywhere."}, {"time": 9983, "text": "And then it joins the global SingularityNet."}, {"time": 9985, "text": "And anyone who puts a request for services out into the SingularityNet, the peer to

cost and so on."}, {"time": 10003, "text": "So that's fairly simple."}, {"time": 10006, "text": "If you wrote an AI and want it listed on like official SingularityNet marketplace, which is on our

that's been an education too."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "There's sort of two layers."}, {"time": 10028, "text": "Like there's the open decentralized protocol."}, {"time": 10031, "text": "And there's the market."}, {"time": 10032, "text": "Yeah, anyone can use the open decentralized protocol."}, {"time": 10035, "text": "So say some developers from Iran and there's brilliant AI guys in University

10048, "text": "But if we're gonna list something on the SingularityNet marketplace and put a little picture and a link to it, then if I put some Iranian AI geniuses code on there, then Donald Trump

token, which is not owned by any country."}, {"time": 10081, "text": "And then if you're in like Congo or somewhere that doesn't have any problem with Iran, you can subcontract AI services that you find on that marketplace, right?"}, {"time": 10091, "text": "Even though US citizens can't by US law."}, {"time": 10096, "text": "So right now, that's kind of a minor point."}, {"time": 10100, "text": "As you alluded, if regulations go in the wrong direction, it could become more of a major point."}, {"time": 10105, "text": "But I think it also is the case that having these workarounds to regulations in place is a defense mechanism against those regulations being put into place."}, {"time": 10116, "text": "And you can see that in the music industry, right?"}, {"time": 10119, "text": "I mean, Napster just happened and BitTorrent just happened."}, {"time": 10123, "text": "And now most people in my kid's generation, they're baffled by the idea of paying for music, right?"}, {"time": 10128, "text": "I mean, my dad pays for music."}, {"time": 10131, "text": "I mean, but that because these decentralized mechanisms happened and then the regulations followed, right?"}, {"time": 10138,

out there in a decentralized vein and big data out there in a decentralized vein now, so that the most advanced AI in the world is fundamentally decentralized."}, {"time": 10158, "text": "And if that's the case, that's just the reality the regulators have to deal with."}, {"time": 10163, "text": "And then as in the music case, they're gonna come up with regulations that sort of work with the

there in front of a whole lot of different people in an emotionally compelling way."}, {"time": 10596, "text": "And part of my thought was really kind of abstract connected to AGI ethics."}, {"time":

uncertainty there just as my dog can't predict what I'm gonna do tomorrow."}, {"time": 10642, "text": "So it seemed to me that based on our current state of knowledge, the best way to bias the AGI as we create toward benevolence would be to infuse them with love and compassion the way that we do our own children."}, {"time": 10661, "text": "So you want to interact with AIs in the context of doing compassionate, loving and beneficial things."}, {"time": 10669, "text": "And in that way, as your children will learn by doing compassionate, beneficial, loving things alongside you."}, {"time": 10675, "text": "And that way the AI will learn in practice what it means to be compassionate, beneficial and loving."}, {"time": 10682, "text": "It will get a sort of ingrained intuitive sense of

with the name Sophia, which means wisdom."}, {"time": 10698, "text": "So it seemed to me making these beautiful, loving robots to be rolled out for beneficial applications would be the perfect way to roll out early stage AGI systems so they can learn from people and not just learn factual knowledge, but learn human values and ethics from people while being their home service robots, their education assistants, their nursing robots."}, {"time": 10724, "text": "So that was the grand vision."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "Now, if you've ever worked with robots, the reality is quite different, right?"}, {"time": 10730, "text": "Like the first principle is the robot is always broken."}, {"time": 10733, "text": "I mean, I worked with robots in the 90s a bunch when you had to solder

"text": "Yeah, so faced with the reality of making Sophia do stuff, many of my robo AGI aspirations were temporarily cast aside."}, {"time": 10766, "text": "And I mean, there's just a practical problem of making this robot interact in a meaningful way because like, you put nice computer vision on there, but there's always glare."}, {"time": 10778, "text": "And then, or you have a dialogue system, but at the time I was there, like no speech to text algorithm could deal with Hong Kongese people's English accents."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "So the speech to text was always bad."}, {"time": 10791, "text": "So the robot always sounded stupid because it wasn't getting the right text, right?"}, {"time": 10795, "text": "So I started to view that really as what in software engineering you call a walking skeleton, which is maybe the wrong metaphor to use for Sophia or maybe the right one."}, {"time": 10806, "text": "I mean, where the walking skeleton is in software development is if you're building a complex system, how do you get started?"}, {"time": 10814, "text": "But one way is to first build part one well, then build part two well, then build part three well and so on."}, {"time": 10819, "text": "And the other way is you make like a simple version of the whole system and put something in the place of every part the whole system will need so that you have a whole system that does something."}, {"time": 10829, "text": "And then you work on improving each part in the context of that whole integrated system."}, {"time": 10834, "text": "So that's what

get up on stage and tell people how Sophia is working, and then they talk to her, they still attribute more agency and consciousness to her than is really there."}, {"time": 11588, "text": "So I think there's a couple of levels of ethical issue there."}, {"time": 11593, "text": "One issue is, should you be transparent about how Sophia is working?"}, {"time": 11601, "text": "And I think you should,

be fooled?"}, {"time": 11641, "text": "And I mean, the whole media industry is based on fooling people the way they want to be fooled."}, {"time": 11646, "text": "And we are fooling people 100% toward a good end."}, {"time": 11651, "text": "I mean, we are playing on people's sense of empathy and compassion so that we can give them a good user experience with helpful robots."}, {"time": 11663,

attention than human nurses can give, right?"}, {"time": 11707, "text": "So if you have a robot that's helping a patient with COVID, if that patient attributes more understanding and compassion and agency to that robot than it really has because it looks like a human, I mean, is that really bad?"}, {"time": 11722, "text": "I mean, we can tell them it doesn't fully understand you and they don't care because they're lying there with a fever and they're sick, but they'll react better to that robot with its loving, warm facial expression than they would to a pepper robot or a metallic looking

every technology."}, {"time": 11762, "text": "So like you said, we're living in the era of the COVID, this is 2020, one of the craziest years in recent history."}, {"time": 11774, "text": "So if we zoom out and look at this pandemic, the coronavirus pandemic, maybe let me ask you this kind of thing in viruses in general, when you look at viruses, do you see them as a kind of intelligence system?"}, {"time": 11795, "text": "I think the concept of intelligence is not that natural of a concept in the end."}, {"time": 11799, "text": "I mean, I think human minds and bodies are a kind of complex self organizing adaptive system."}, {"time": 11809, "text": "And viruses certainly are that, right?"}, {"time": 11811, "text": "They're a very complex self organizing adaptive system."},

which has a lot of intelligence to it."}, {"time": 11841, "text": "And viruses are also adapting and dividing into new mutant strains and so forth."}, {"time": 11847, "text": "And ultimately the solution is gonna be nanotechnology, right?"}, {"time": 11852, "text": "The solution is gonna be making little nanobots that."}, {"time": 11855, "text": "Fight the viruses or."}, {"time": 11858, "text": "Well, people will use them to make nastier viruses, but hopefully we can also use them to just detect combat and kill the viruses."}, {"time": 11866, "text": "But I think now we're stuck with the biological mechanisms to combat these viruses."}, {"time": 11874, "text": "And yeah, we've been AGI is not yet mature enough to use against COVID, but we've been using machine learning and also some machine reasoning in open cog to help some doctors to do personalized medicine against COVID."}, {"time": 11891, "text": "So the problem there is given the person's genomics and given their clinical medical indicators, how do you figure out which combination of antivirals is gonna be most effective against COVID for that person?"}, {"time": 11904, "text": "And so that's something where machine learning is interesting, but also we're finding the abstraction to get an open cog with machine reasoning is interesting because it can help with transfer learning when you have not that many different cases to study and qualitative differences between different strains of a virus or people of different ages who may have COVID."}, {"time": 11927, "text": "So there's a lot of different disparate data to work with and it's small data sets and somehow integrating them."}, {"time": 11933, "text": "This is one of the shameful things that's very hard to get that data."}, {"time": 11965,

these clinical trials were done were reported by Surgisphere, some little company no one ever heard of and everyone paid attention to this."}, {"time": 11993, "text": "So they were doing more clinical trials based on that then they stopped doing clinical trials based on that then they started again and why isn't that data just out there so everyone can analyze it and see what's going on, right?"},

of?"}, {"time": 12015, "text": "It's not in the immediate future because the US and China frictions are getting very high."}, {"time": 12021, "text": "So it's hard to see US and China as moving in the direction of openly sharing data with each other, right?"}, {"time": 12027, "text": "It's not, there's some sharing of data, but different groups are keeping their data private till they've milked the best results from it and then they share it, right?"}, {"time": 12036, "text": "So yeah, we're working with some data that we've managed to get our hands on, something we're doing to do good for the world and it's a very cool playground for like putting deep neural nets and open cog together."}, {"time": 12047, "text": "So we have like a bioadden space full of all sorts of knowledge from many different biology experiments about human longevity and from biology knowledge bases online."}, {"time": 12057, "text": "And we can do like graph to vector type embeddings where we take nodes from the hypergraph, embed them into vectors, which can then feed into neural nets for different types of analysis."}, {"time": 12067, "text": "And we were doing this in the context of a project called Rejuve

things that people weren't seeing otherwise."}, {"time": 12121, "text": "Cause the thing in this case is for each combination of antivirals, you may have only a few patients who've tried that combination."}, {"time": 12128, "text": "And those few patients may have their particular characteristics."}, {"time": 12131, "text": "Like this combination of three was tried only on people age 80 or over."}, {"time": 12136, "text": "This other combination of three, which has an overlap with the first combination was tried more on young people."}, {"time": 12142, "text": "So how do you combine those different pieces of data?"}, {"time": 12145, "text": "It's a very dodgy transfer learning problem, which is the kind of thing that the probabilistic reasoning algorithms we have inside OpenCog

than OpenCog."}, {"time": 12172, "text": "Cause it's just these huge, huge messy floating point vectors that are annoying for a logic engine to deal with, but are perfect for a decision forest or a neural net."}, {"time": 12182, "text": "So it's a great playground for like hybrid AI methodology."}, {"time": 12187, "text": "And we can have SingularityNet have OpenCog in one agent and XGBoost in a different agent and they talk to each other."}, {"time": 12194, "text": "But at the same time, it's highly practical, right?"}, {"time": 12198, "text": "Cause we're working with, for example, some

the decentralized finance is the instantiation of a specific type of smart contract, right?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "Or what I call hybrid smart contracts, which are these contracts that combine the on chain code together with the off chain proofs that something happened."}, {"time": 880, "text": "They're called a hybrid because they basically use both of these systems, right?"}, {"time": 883, "text": "The blockchain and the proofs about what happened."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And what DeFi is, is one specific type of hybrid smart contract that is taking on the contractual agreements you traditionally find in the global financial system, right?"}, {"time": 901, "text": "And that's basically the world of lending, the world of yield generation for people giving me or giving whoever their money and somebody giving back them yield back to them, which is what bonds do and what treasuries do and what a lot of the global financial markets do, as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection from different types of events and risks."}, {"time": 923, "text": "That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something's gonna happen."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And I'm either gonna protect myself by getting paid if it happens, or I'm going to benefit from it happening by basically saying it's gonna happen, putting money down on that, and that prediction will get me a return."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Now, that's a very large part of the global financial system, excluding all the stuff for global trade and letters of credit and all the stuff that facilitates international trade."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So excluding that at least for now."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So if we look at what decentralized finance does, it takes all of those agreements about generating yield, lending, and all of these types of things you find in global finance and the world of derivatives and a few other types of financial products."}, {"time": 964, "text": "And it basically puts them into a different format, right?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "So the format you have for centralized financial agreements is that you go to a bank, even if you're a hedge fund, even if you're like the richest people, you go to a bank, they make a product for you, and you hope that they honor the product that they made for you."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Or you do a deal with another hedge fund or whoever, some counterparty, and you hope that that deal is honored."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And then a number of very freaky things start to take place."}, {"time": 992, "text": "One of them is people don't have clarity about what the agreement is, right?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "So a lot of people don't know exactly what the agreement is between those parties because they can't actually see it."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Sometimes agreements are kept very private or parts of them are kept private."},

mortgage crisis."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically, there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets, but because the centralized financial system worked in such an opaque way, it was so unbelievably difficult to understand what was going on, right?"}, {"time": 1031, "text": "And so that lack of understanding for the global financial system basically led to a big boom, and then correspondingly, very, very big bust, which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody, even though they didn't participate in the boom part of the equation."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "In any case, what decentralized finance does is it takes these financial contracts that power the global financial system, it puts them in this new blockchain based format that basically at this point provides three very powerful things."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "The first thing that it provides is complete transparency over what's going on with your financial product."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So you have complete transparency into what's going on in the financial protocol that you have your assets in, which is because blockchains and the infrastructure, all of these things are built on, force that transparency."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Whereas the centralized financial system is very, very good at hiding it."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It's very good at hiding it and packaging things in a glossy wrapper, creating a boom, then a bust."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "The centralized finance is built on infrastructure that forces transparency such that everyone can understand what the financial product does from day one."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And in fact, escaping that property is practically impossible or if someone tries to escape it, it becomes immediately obvious and people don't use their financial product."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So that's number one."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "Number two is control."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So if you look at what happened with Robinhood, everybody thought the system worked a certain way, right?"}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Everybody thought I have a brokerage account, I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And then the market conditions changed within the band of what people thought they could do."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And everybody was fascinated to find out that, oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions in which I can control my assets is X, but it is actually Y, is actually much, much smaller band."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And the reason it is a much, much smaller group of market conditions is that the system doesn't work the way people think it works."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper and given to them to get them to participate in the system because the system requires and needs their participation."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "But if you actually look at how the system works underneath, you will see that it does not work the way people think that it works."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts, give people the version of the world they think they already have, which is why they don't beg for it, right?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So everybody thinks they're in a certain version of the world that works in this reliable way, transparent way, they're not."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "They don't realize it."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And so they're confused when you tell them, I'm gonna make the world work this way because they think they're already in that world."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "But then things like Robinhood make it immediately, painfully clear that that's not how the world works so that the second real property of DeFi is control, which means that you control your assets, not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "You control your Bitcoins, you control your tokens in the finance protocol."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "If you don't like how something's going in that protocol, you can remove it, you can send it to another protocol, or you can use a feature of the protocol to do something it's supposed to do."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Nobody can just say, oops, that feature, that isn't so good for my friends over here."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "That feature is actually, we're just gonna pause that feature in the critical moment when you need it to execute your strategy, which is why you took all the risks to begin with."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "And then the final reason, the final thing to know about DeFi is that DeFi is inherently global, and actually right now provides better yield globally."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar, you get 1% or less."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "It is this clarity about your risk."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "It is control over your assets."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And amazingly, at the same time as having those two unbelievably useful properties, it is actually superior yield, which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion that the only reason DeFi is more used is because more people don't know about it."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "And by virtue of this long kind of explanation here and elsewhere, more people will know about it."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And it's just such an obviously superior solution that I haven't heard a single explanation as to why."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "No, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk and have more transparency with your assets."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Earn 7% less, take more risk, and give people the ability to change the rules on you at their discretion, go do that."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Who's gonna do that?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And in general, on the first two of transparency and control, first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, they're deeply tied together in the sense that transparency gives control."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Transparency creates accountability, and there's this kind of game being played, game theoretic game, where if I know, if you know I'm gonna discover your deviation, you're not gonna deviate."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Yes, this could be a whole nother conversation, but just as a small aside, on the social network side of things, which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so, of how to do it right there, how to fix our social media."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And I tend to believe that human beings, if they're given clear transparency about which data is being stored, how it's being used, where it's being moved about, just all a clear, simple transparency of how their data is being used, and them having the control at the very minimal level of being able to participate or to walk away, and walk away means delete everything you've ever known about me."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "That will create a much, much better world."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "That currently there's a complete lack of transparency on social media, how the data is being used for your own protection."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of parallels to the central bank situation, and there's not a control element of being able to walk away."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Like being able to delete all your data, delete your account on Facebook is very difficult."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "It doesn't take a single click, which I think is what it should take."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "There should be a big red button that says, delete everything you've ever known about me, or like forget me."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So I think that coupled together can create a very different kind of world and create an incentivization that will lead to like progress and innovation and just like a much better social network and a really good business for the future social networks."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "But so I tend to see like control as naturally being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "It should all start at the transparency, which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Because like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way, any agreements that you're participating in."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And as a side comment also, what's really inspiring to me is that I think there's a greater, I don't know if this is always the case, but it seems like from having talked to people on the psychological element, there's a hunger amongst people for transparency and for control."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now, they want to know the reality of who you are as an individual."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So that means you can create businesses, you can create tools that are built on authenticity, a transparency."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And then the same, I'm inspired by the intelligence of people, if you give them control, if you give them power, that they would make good choices."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Of course, not everybody, but that means that decentralized power can create effective systems."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "So couple that, there's a hunger for transparency so we can move to a world where everyone's being just like real, conveying their genuine human nature."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And people are sufficiently intelligent that if they're given power in a distributed mass scale sense, that we're going to build a better world through that, as opposed to centralized supervised control or only a small percent of the population know what the hell they're doing."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Everybody else is clueless sheep."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Just to really quickly comment on this stuff that you just said, which I think is super, super, super fascinating."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "I think that's all exactly right."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "I think everything that you said is right."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So they get all the features, but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability to have control while getting all the features, right?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So banks give you features, social media sites give you features, whatever other system that you use online gives you features, and then it takes your data and it takes control of your assets from you in return for those features, right?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "I think the whole big difference here, partly in line with the definition of smart contracts and its evolution is that there's this, now there's this autonomous piece of code that's giving you all those features without requiring the ownership and lock in and control and unilateral kind of ownership of your data or your value or whatever it is that you're giving it, right?"}, {"time": 1718, "text": "And so this is just the recurring pattern of what I think all of this will do is it'll give people, it gives people a better deal, right?"}, {"time": 1726, "text": "It gives them features without ownership of data, without ownership of value, and that's really the difference."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So I think this is a good place to talk about smart contracts then."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "Can you tell me the history of smart contracts and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "Sure, so I think smart contracts as a definition has actually gone through some kind of changes or small evolution."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "Initially, I think it was actually a conception of a digital agreement that was tamper proof and could know things about the world, right?"}, {"time": 1757, "text": "So it could get proof and it could define that something happened and it could conclude an outcome and release payment or do something else."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "That's actually the definition of smart contracts that I began working in this industry with seven or eight years ago when I started making smart contracts."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "That is the conception that I had of a smart contract."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?"}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement that could also know things about the real world and release payments back to people about those events that were codified in this tamper proof format was actually a very tall order."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "Turns out it's consistent of three parts."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "It's consisting of the contract, the proof about what happened and the release of value."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "The way things have evolved so far is that the definition has now come to mean on chain code."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So it's come to mean the codification of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain that defines what the agreement is."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Now that eliminates the part of the definition that's related to knowing things about the world and it partly eliminates the definition about payments and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "But basically it's on chain code, right?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We in our recent work on a second white paper have actually put out a different definition that we call hybrid smart contracts that actually tries to go back to the initial definition that I started with seven or eight years ago, which basically says that there's some proof somewhere that's proven to the contract and the contract can know that and the contract can gain proof."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement that's codified on a blockchain."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "So you both need a mechanism to provide proof."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "You need a mechanism to codify the contract in a tamper proof way on something like a blockchain."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And then as with all contracts, there's a presumption that there's some kind of release of value."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So I think a smart contract in our industry right now means on chain code, which limits it to whatever can be done on chain only."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "And then in our internal definition for us and for us at Chainlink and for me, it's hybrid smart contracts, which is actually the original definition."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened and automatically resolve to the proper outcome based on what happened."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "So you're referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper, which is a paper that I recommend people look."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "It's a very easy read and very well structured and very thorough."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So I really enjoyed it."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Very recently released, I guess."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Can you dig in deeper?"}, {"time": 1913, "text": "What is a hybrid smart contract?"}, {"time": 1917, "text": "You mentioned sort of this idea of data or knowing about the world and on chain and off chain."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So what are the different roles in this?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact that it's on chain and off chain contracts."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?"}, {"time": 1941, "text": "Like how do you actually achieve that?"}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "That's the smart contract itself."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And that's where you codify certain conditions, such as the conditions under which an interest payment is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out the full amount that it holds to someone based on a derivative outcome or something like that."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Now, what the on chain code is very good at is creating transparency about what the core conditions of the contract are."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It's very good at taking in money from other private keys that send it tokens and send it value to hold."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And then it's also very good at returning money or returning value back to other addresses or other private keys."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "It can also be involved in governance."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It can be involved in a few other private key signature based operations."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "But primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract, from what I've seen so far, defines the agreement, takes in value and returns value based upon the conditions codified in the agreement on a blockchain."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "The second and equally important off chain part is where the term oracle and an oracle comes in or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network as we describe it in the paper."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "And this is another decentralized computational system that has a different goal, right?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions into blocks and connecting them in a cryptographically unique way to create security and assurance about that chain of transactions."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "Oracles and decentralized oracle networks achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization about the topic of what happened, right?"}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So blockchains structure transactions."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "Some of those transactions might be the state changes in different pieces of on chain code."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And then those on chain pieces of code require input."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit thrown by is despite being called smart contracts, the on chain code on a blockchain cannot actually speak to any other system."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So blockchains are valuable and useful as far as they're tamper proof and secure."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "And to be tamper proof and secure, they're made this kind of walled garden that is able to know and interact only with the highly reliable information that's within that system, which is basically tokens and private key signatures."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "All the other world's information is not available in a blockchain inherently."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And a smart contract or a piece of on chain code can't just say, hey, I'm gonna go get some data from over here because the API they would get it from creates a whole bunch of security concerns for the blockchain itself and a whole bunch of consensus issues about how to agree on what that API said or what the truth of the world is, right?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said, it's more so creating a reliable form of decentralized computation that can give you a definitive proof of what happened and not just what one API said."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So for example, some of our most widely used networks have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources that are all providing information about the same type of data."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And then there's consensus on that one piece of data, which is then written in and essentially given back into the on chain code to tell it what happened because you can't really make an agreement unless you know what happened, right?"}, {"time": 2154, "text": "If you and me were to make an agreement and set some contractual conditions, but our agreement could never know what happened, it would be completely useless."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "However, if you and me made an agreement and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism or decentralized Oracle network that proved what happened definitively and you and me pre agreed that whatever this mechanism says is what happened, then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "We can suddenly say, there's this piece of on chain code that's highly reliable."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "We can give it millions, billions, eventually trillions of dollars in value."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And it is controlled by this other system over here that's also highly reliable under this configurable set of definitive truth and decentralization conditions, which we all agree are sufficiently stringent to control that much value."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And therefore the combination of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract and this mutually agreed upon definition of a trigger or a proof system combined is a hybrid smart contract, which as you can see probably already does a lot more than just a contract on chain, right?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Can you talk about this consensus mechanism, which by the way is just fascinating."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "So there's the on chain consensus mechanism of proof of work and proof of stake."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism of what is true."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So how do you, can you compare the two?"}, {"time": 2246, "text": "Like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?"}, {"time": 2248, "text": "How do you achieve security in integrating data about the world in a way that's definitively true in a way that is usefully true, such that we can rely on it in making major agreements that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "Right, so this is the challenging, this is the challenging question, right?"}, {"time": 2271, "text": "This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks, Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on in order to create this definitive truth to trigger and create hyper automation in this more advanced form, more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "The reality I think of this problem is that it is very specific to each use case."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And it, and this is actually how we've architected our system is in a very flexible way."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network to grow in the amount of nodes that it has relative to the value it secures, right?"}, {"time": 2313, "text": "So if you have an Oracle network that secures a hundred thousand dollars in like a beta of a financial product, maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes and only two or three data sources, right?"}, {"time": 2324, "text": "Because the risk to that Oracle network is relatively low based on the value it secures."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So the first question is actually how do you scale security relative to value secured by that Oracle network?"}, {"time": 2339, "text": "Because it wouldn't be very efficient to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale and how do we compose ensembles of nodes in a decentralized way where we can know that, okay, we're going from seven nodes in a network to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?"}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So that's one dimension of the problem."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "So you have to be scaling the number of nodes relative to the value that's derived from the truth integrated into those nodes."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "Well, that's not the only problem, right?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "The other side of this is that you're trying to create a deterministic result, a deterministic output from a set of non deterministic disparate systems, data sources, or places that prove things."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "Can you also, just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?"}, {"time": 2391, "text": "What is the role of an Oracle node?"}, {"time": 2393, "text": "Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists in both places, it exists in both worlds."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It exists as an on chain contract that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "So there's an on chain interface in the form of a contract that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "You can request weather data from me, you can request price data from me, you can ask me to send a payment somewhere."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "So it's like an API, so it's a pointer to a API that provides truth about this world."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "It's an interface, so just like an API is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers, Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them or individual nodes are the interface of Web 3.0's use of services."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And services includes all services, data, payment systems, messaging systems, whatever Web 2.0 or any kind of computing service that you can conceptualize, needs an interface on chain in the form of a contract that says, here are the services I can provide for you, here are the transactions you need to send me to get back this data or that computation or this result."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "And then what you actually see is that decentralized Oracle networks, because they're uniquely capable of generating their own computations in a decentralized way around the data that they have access to, you actually see decentralized Oracle networks generating a lot of these services."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So for example, we have a randomness service, a verifiable randomness function service that basically provides randomness on chain and that randomness is then used in lotteries and various other contracts that need randomness."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "But that randomness, it's not a piece of data that comes from somewhere else."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "We don't go to another data source and get it."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "We generate it within an Oracle node that then provides it over into Oracle node or Oracle nodes that provide it into the contracts themselves."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So why do you say Oracle nodes are non deterministic?"}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Well, they are as far as they come to consensus, but there's this kind of different problem here, right?"}, {"time": 2525, "text": "The blockchains are very focused on generating blocks of transactions within a smaller universe of transaction types, a certain block size and a certain set of conditions."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And then they have a economic system that says, I will perpetually generate blocks of this size with these transaction types in this kind of limited set of transaction types, whether those are UTXO transactions or scripted solidity or whatever it is."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Oracles and Oracle networks, we don't have a blockchain, for example."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "There is no chain link blockchain."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Our goal is not to generate a certain set of very clearly predetermined transaction types into a set of transactions that are put into blocks and it will infinitely be done that way."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "Our goal is actually to create what we call a Meta layer, a decentralized Meta layer between the non deterministic, highly unreliable world and the highly hyper reliable world of blockchains so that the unreliable world can be passed through this decentralized Meta layer."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And it can coexist with a reliable on chain world."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases, the Meta layer might generate it."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So the problem in giving you this straight answer is that there's just such a wide array of services."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "If you were to say, well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness from a data source?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Well, we don't use a data source to generate the randomness."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "That's the type of service that can be generated in an Oracle network itself."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And so there'll be certain computations that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves to augment and improve blockchains."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And it is actually the goal of Oracles to consistently do that."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So if you were to think about the stack in a very generic high level, you would see blockchains or databases."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "They're basically the data structures that retain a lot of information in this transparent, highly reliable form."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "Smart contract code is the application logic."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "It is the logic under which all of this kind of activity occurs, storing data in the data structure in the blockchain as a database in a certain conceptualization of it."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "And then Oracles and Oracle networks are all the services that are used by the application code."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So, you know, by analogy, let's take Uber."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API from Google Maps about the user's location, sends a message to the user through Twilio, pays the driver through Stripe."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "If those services weren't available to the people who made Uber, they wouldn't have made Uber, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Because they would have written their core code on some database, and then they would have had to make a geolocation company, a telecom messaging company, and the global payments company."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "And that's the weird scenario that a lot of people in our industry are in."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And that's the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix is they provide these decentralized services to take this developer ecosystem, the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem from, hey, I can have a database and write some application logic about tokenization and voting and private key signing, all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "But now, if you just layer on all the world's services, whether that's market data, weather data, randomness, suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming, fraud proof global trade, fraud proof ad networks."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "And that's why this world of decentralized services and decentralized Oracle networks is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And you talk about the currents of a decentralized world, decentralized world, DeFi, but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And it's basically just financial transactions."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "And the kind of thing, the reason why it's super exciting, the kind of thing you do with Chainlink and Oracle networks is that you can basically open up the whole world of services to this kind of decentralized smart contract world."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude greater impact financially and just socially and philosophically."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Are there interesting near term and long term applications that excite you?"}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot that excites me."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And that is how I think about it, that it's not just about we made a decentralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "It's about we made a decentralized service or collection of services that's going from hundreds to thousands."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And then people are able to build the hybrid smart contracts, which I think will redefine what our industry is about."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Because for example, for the people that only learned about blockchains through the lens of

cases that excite me, they vary between the developed market, the developed world's economies and emerging markets."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "I think in the developed world, what you will see is that

2008."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I think in the process of doing that and which is happening, I think right about now, you see a polishing of the technology such that it can be made available to emerging markets."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And on a personal level, I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more from this technology, just like the emerging markets benefit much more

went from zero to one in a very, very dramatic way."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I think all of these smart contracts, and in my case, I think the one that I seem to keep coming back to is crop

{"time": 2937, "text": "Right, so this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard to see the full value of what our industry does, because it solves all these kinds of backend problems that we don't have, right?"}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain, I get an insurance payout, so I don't need to close down my farm, because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?"}, {"time": 2959, "text": "So people in the developed world can get crop insurance and there's all kinds of systems that basically pay them out, and then they can argue with the insurance company if they don't get paid out properly and whatever."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And this allows people to smooth out risk."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "In fact, a lot of the global

weren't impacted by it, right?"}, {"time": 2989, "text": "And that's where a lot of options trading and all this kind of stuff came from, even though it's now turned into this kind of global casino."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "But in the emerging market, there are literally people that, if they don't have rain for two seasons, they need to close down their farm and become a migrant worker

technology, if I have a $50 Android phone and the smart contract has data from satellites or weather stations about the weather conditions in the geography that my farm is in, I can put value into the

that this new level of systems that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody, between supply chain partners, ad network users, the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers, all of

in, they provide all the services."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So just like you would be writing code in web 2.0 land, running it on a server somewhere and using an API, here you'd be writing code,

financial."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "It's philosophical."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "It's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like what is human civilization?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "It's interaction between humans."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction that is managed by programming languages,

than anything else we do today."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "You think about the impact of the internet, one of the cool things is digitization of data."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "But we have not yet

think about the role of artificial intelligence in all of this."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements, maybe you disagree with this, but at least the way I'm thinking about it is agreements between humans or groups of humans."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "But it seems like because everything's operating in the digital space that you can integrate non humans into this."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Or AI systems that help out humans, managed by humans."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "Like what do you think about a world of hybrid smart contracts, codifying agreements between hybrid intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?"}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Yeah, I think that makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So it might be a bit simplistic or naive, my ideas in this field."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?"}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And it was like, this is really scary."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "I personally think AI is amazing and makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "I think it will evolve to a place where people have... Just to understand, I work in the world of trust issues, right?"}, {"time": 3909, "text": "I work in the world of how can technology solve trust and collaboration issues using encryption, using cryptographically guaranteed systems, using decentralized infrastructure, right?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "So that's the world that I've been inhabiting for many, many years now, building smart contracts for seven or eight, doing stuff before that."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "It's kind of what I'm focused on."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "So I view AI through that same lens."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "And my brain naturally asks, well, what is the trust issue that people might have with AI?"}, {"time": 3937, "text": "And my natural kind of response is, well, let's say AI continues to be built and improve."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "I've seen different ideas that were very far from this."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "I've seen other ideas were very close to this."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI where we would be a little bit worried about just how much it could do, right?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "We might be worried that AI could do things we don't want it to do, but we still want to give AI a level of control over our lives, right?"}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So in my world, that's a trust issue."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "And the way that that trust issue would be solved with blockchains is actually very straightforward."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "You could have an AI that has an ability to do and control key parts of your and our lives, right?"}, {"time": 3988, "text": "But then you could limit it with private keys and blockchains and create certain guardrails and firm kind of walls and limits to what the AI could never go past, assuming that encryption, right?"}, {"time": 4006, "text": "That encryption continues to work, right?"}, {"time": 4009, "text": "And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able to do that, right?"}, {"time": 4016, "text": "So if you have an AI that controls something very important, whatever it is, shipping or something in defense or something in the financial system, whatever it is, but you're sitting there and you're kind of worried, hey, this thing is unbelievable."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "It's coming up with things we wouldn't have thought of in a hundred years, but maybe it's a little too unbelievable."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "How do you limit it?"}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Well, if you bake in private keys and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations, you can create the conditions beyond which an AI could never act."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "And those could once again be codified in the very specific unambiguous terms in which you described, which once again, in my trust issue focused world, would solve the trust issue for users and make them comfortable with using the AI or ceding control to the AI, which I think in more advanced versions of AI will continue to be a concern, right?"}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism for human supervision of AI systems."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "With encryption, very encryption heavy."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "It's about will the encryption hold up?"}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So that's based on the assumption that encryption holds up."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "I think that's a safe assumption."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "We can get into that whole discussion, but from quantum computing, but cracking encryption is very difficult."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "That's a whole nother discussion."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "I think we're safe on the safe ground for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "I, there's a space that is at the cutting edge of general intelligence research in the AI community, which is the space of program synthesis or AI generating programs."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "So that's different than what you're referring to is AI being able to generate smart contracts."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "And that to me is kind of fascinating to think of, especially two AI systems between each other, generating contracts, sort of almost creating a world where most of the contracts are between nonhuman beings."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "I think an AI system, as I think about it, and once again, this is not my field."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "This is something I might watch a YouTube video on or just see something interesting about at some point."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "I think if I were to just reason through it even now, I think the highly deterministic and guaranteed nature of smart contracts would probably be preferable to an AI because I'm guessing an AI would have a lot of problems with dealing with the human element of how contracts work today, right?"}, {"time": 4185, "text": "So an AI, for example, couldn't pick up the phone and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative and kind of discuss with Dave and have a call with him and kind of have a conversation and get him comfortable and tell him it's gonna be fine and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues that have to do with making certain derivatives."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated neural map AI kind of problem."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Yeah, so if I think about it, the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts probably would, and if, assuming they're accessible to AIs, could actually, interestingly enough, be the format that they prefer to codify their relationship with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems, right, because it is very, I mean, it's pretty guaranteed, right?"}, {"time": 4244, "text": "All the other types of contracts that an AI could go out there and seek to do would require some language processing around the law."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "And I think, I don't know if this is a term, but probably not a smart AI or a good AI or whatever the term is for a high quality AI, would probably realize some of the limitations and the risks."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity and would prefer the determinism, the deterministic nature of smart contracts."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "I do wonder about this particular problem and maybe you could speak to it of how smart contracts can take over certain industries in a sense or how certain industries can convert their sets of agreements into smart contracts, which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave from the bank, many of our laws, many of our agreements are currently through natural language, through words."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur in order to convert the legal agreements, legal contracts of today to smart contracts that by the way, AI may be able to help with."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "But by way of question, how do you think we convert the legal contracts on which many industries currently function today or not even legal contracts, but ambiguous kind of agreements, maybe they're loose sometimes into more formal deterministic agreements that are represented by smart contracts?"}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "I think the first one is actually not a huge problem where you have things like the is the master agreement for derivatives or you have these agreements that basically already reference a system somewhere, like for example, many legal agreements already accept eSignature."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And so they're saying, hey, I'm gonna use this computing system over here around signatures and I'm gonna consider, and there's laws around that and there's clauses that say eSignature is good enough for this agreement."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "I actually don't think this is a big problem for the vast majority of legal agreements that use systems already."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository or one set of system of contract settlement."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And you'll just say, hey, this blockchain system over here is my new system of contract settlement."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Whatever it says is the state of the agreement instead of the centralized system over there."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements that are already able to do that and I think we'll do that."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "I think there's another side to your question, which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous that can be turned into smart contracts."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "And I think the limitation there is twofold."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "First of all, like you said earlier, the highly reliable smart contract and the lack of opaqueness and the clarity of smart contracts is very high and very powerful and very clear and it's, in my opinion, gonna be much, much easier to take a smart contract and turn it into a set of natural language explanations and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?"}, {"time": 4467, "text": "Mapping smart contracts into natural language, I didn't even think about that."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "So that's, you're saying that's doable and natural and easy to do."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "Because there's so much clear, right?"}, {"time": 4477, "text": "There's that forced clarity that you talked about."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "I think the second aspect of this problem is the nuance around what contracts can be made unambiguous and I think that comes down to, often comes down to proving what happened, which is where Oracle networks and decentralized Oracle networks and Chainlink would come in and our experience there is quite extensive over the many years that we've worked on many different contract types."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "I think what it fundamentally comes down to is whether there is data."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "So we're not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract about whether somebody painted your house the right color blue."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "We're just not gonna be doing that because there's no data feed that tells us that your house was painted blue or that it was the right color of blue."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "You know, unless somebody sets up a drone with a color analysis tool and they generate that data."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Which by the way, it could be possible, right?"}, {"time": 4529, "text": "They could, there could be, if there's enough demand then the service would be created that has drones flying around that's telling you about the colors of, you know, all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "So if there's actual demand that that would be created and because there'll be value to connect that data feed to the smart contracts and so on."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "I think you have it unbelievably right because there are already insurance companies that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead and see how many people are wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats isn't sufficiently high, then, you know, the policy is voided."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And so in that case, there is a data source and that data source can be put into a hybrid smart contract."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is, is there a data source or a set of data sources to create definitive truth, to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "And then as you said, I think as people realize that smart contracts are a format in which they can form agreement about things like that insurance product around, you know, how many people are wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "If I'm the construction site owner, well, you know, I would really like a guarantee that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out if everyone is wearing hard hats."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And in that case, there is demand for the data and people will generate the data."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And I actually think the insurance industry is interestingly a precursor of this because they're so data driven."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "You already see insurance companies paying IoT companies to put data into their customer's infrastructure at the cost of the insurance company to generate the data that the insurance company uses to make a policy for the customer."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "So you basically already have people who really want to price data into their agreements when they're of sufficiently high value paying for their own customers to get data sensors into their infrastructure."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And I think as smart contracts become more of a requested format or data driven contracts become more of a format, there will be a growing demand about proving what happened through data."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "So it'll be motivating totally new data feeds being created."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "By the way, the insurance industry broadly, the revolutions there, it would be huge."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles, semi autonomous and just vehicles in general."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "The insurance industry there, by the way, makes a huge amount of money, but is using very crappy data feeds, revolutionizing how like not by crappy, I mean very crude."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Like literally the insurance is based on things like age, gender, like basic demographic information as opposed to really high resolution information about you as an individual, which you may or may not want to provide."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So you can choose from an individual perspective to provide a data feed."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "And there like the power of insurance to enable the individual, to empower the individual could be huge because ultimately smart contracts motivate the use of data, the creation of new data feeds, but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth, as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "So that I'm not, again, not sure how that would change things, but in terms of the fundamental experience of life, because I think we all rely on insurance, not just in business, but in life and grounding that insurance in more and more accurate representation of reality might just have transformative effects on society."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said, where I noticed another trust issue, you said the user might not want to share their data."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "So what you could actually do, and what we've already worked on is, you can have a smart contract that holds the data and evaluates the data of the user without sharing it with the insurance companies."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And the insurance company knows that the smart contract will evaluate it according to the policy."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "They don't need the data."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "And the user can provide the data knowing it'll never touch the insurance company because it's only provided to the smart contract."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "And suddenly you've solved another trust issue because the autonomous piece of code can evaluate information separately from the interests of both of the counterparties."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "And so this is the recurring theme."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "And once you have an autonomous piece of code that can also know what's going on, thanks to Oracle networks and that combination of the code and the Oracle network for the hybrid smart contract, the same pattern just recurs."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "It's really the same pattern."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "And this is why I keep saying trust issues."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It's because I basically, almost every contractual trust issue that I see where there is a piece of data to prove and settle the trust issue in a way that works for both parties, there is no reason not to use an autonomous, highly reliable contract and piece of code."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "And I have to tell you, I've seen this in a lot of different industries."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "I've seen it insurance, ad networks, global finance, global trade, those are all multi trillion dollar industries."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And then there are other smaller industries."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "Like even one of the first smart contracts we worked on many years ago was for search engine optimization firms where they would tell you, hey, I'm gonna raise your search engine ranking, give me the money."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And people wouldn't wanna give them the money because they never knew if they were gonna do it."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And then the search engine firm doesn't wanna do any work thinking they'll never get any money."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "So we just initially even came up with a system where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract and it would be released based on whether the search rank of a website got to a certain level on Google for a certain keyword, right?"}, {"time": 4907, "text": "And so the trust problem was solved."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "But it's just the same story, right?"}, {"time": 4910, "text": "It's kind of like trust issues around AI, trust issues around financial products, trust issues around insurance, trust issues around social media, whatever it is."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "I think that's what people looking at this industry really need to understand."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "And once they do understand, they realize what this is all about."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "This is about redefining how everyone collaborates with everyone about everything where we can prove something through data."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy that the parties don't need to necessarily know private data in this interaction."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "You talk about confidentiality in the white paper for Chainlink 2.0."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality in this process?"}, {"time": 4959, "text": "Sure, sure, absolutely."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So I think you once again need to think of the contract as existing in two parts, right?"}, {"time": 4967, "text": "You have the on chain code and then you have this off chain system called the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So the question is really what portion of the contract should live in what part of these two systems, right?"}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So if you wanna create transparency, you should put more information on chain because that's what blockchains are very good at."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "They're public, transparent, but they don't necessarily have privacy."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "Well, you can see how those two things are a little bit kind of completely diametrically opposed."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So I do think and I do see blockchains working on on chain encrypted smart contracts."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "That's very inefficient."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "It has a lot of nuances around it."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "That I think will appear at some point."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "I think until it appears, you have an option of taking a part of the computation and putting it into the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "We actually did an entire paper about this that we presented at Stanford in February of last year, something called Mixicles, which basically talks about how you can take an Oracle network and you can put a portion of the computation into the Oracle network, assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set of nodes knowing what the computation is."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "And you could actually provide additional confidentiality through special hardware called trusted execution environments that all those nodes are forced to run."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "So they won't even know what they're operating."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And so at the end of the day, if you look at a hybrid smart contract as gaining functionality from its on chain code and gaining other functionality from its off chain decentralized Oracle network component, you can place the part of the computation that you would like to be private in the decentralized Oracle network, because you can control the set of nodes."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "You can control the committee of nodes and you can require that they run certain hardware to keep the information private, right?"}, {"time": 5088, "text": "So you could basically make a derivative that, or a binary option is the example used in the Mixicles paper where the payout happened on chain, but it was actually impossible to tell what the outcome of the contract was."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "So the outcome of the contract was computed in the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "Determined a certain outcome that the relevant user would get paid and there was still a place to put value, right?"}, {"time": 5145, "text": "So there is this kind of fundamental tension between confidentiality, privacy, which is very important for many contracts, which is critical to many contracts and the public and transparent nature of blockchains, which I think eventually will be solved through encrypted on chain smart contracts."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "That'll take some time, I think that'll take years in my opinion."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "And before we arrive there, I think people will put the private portion into the centralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "Once again, going back to what the decentralized Oracle networks do, they seek to provide these services, right?"}, {"time": 5181, "text": "So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation is perhaps a service without which a certain type of contract might never come into existence in the form of an on chain hybrid smart contract."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "And so this is once again, what we see the centralized Oracle networks and decentralized services doing is providing people these tools and building blocks to compose, like I'm great at making these derivatives contracts, but I can't make them unless I can retain the privacy of them."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "And our goal is to provide the infrastructure that gives you as a developer and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "And what we've seen is that as we provide that capability, people create more, which is also really the story of the internet, right?"}, {"time": 5227, "text": "The story of the internet is it was really tough to do eCommerce while everything was an HTTP and credit cards were transmitted publicly."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "And so eCommerce was kind of tough because how am I gonna send my credit card over public on encrypted channels, right?"}, {"time": 5241, "text": "But the second HTTPS appears, eCommerce becomes a lot easier because I can put in my credit card number and it can be sent over an encrypted channel and it's not at risk."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "And so I can participate in eCommerce as long as I have a credit card."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "I think those types, and I'm sure that was unexpected, right, I'm sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome from that technology."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And so I think this is why we sometimes have this focus on privacy because in our work with contracts and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form, we see a substantial amount of need for privacy as an inherent property of these contracts."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "And it'll take a while before that's possible to create the kind of technology innovation required to do that on chain."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "I know there's a few ideas that are being floating about, but so the currently distributed Oracle networks provide that feature, which is essential to many contracts."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "What brings to mind in this whole space, again, it might be outside of your expertise, but within the world which I'm passionate about, which is machine learning, and it seems like very naturally because current machine learning systems are very data hungry and much of the value mined by companies in the digital space are from data."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "They often want their data to maintain privacy."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "So you think about an autonomous vehicle space, Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data, Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "It seems like it would be very beneficial to form contracts where one could use the data from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way, but also where all the uses of data are codified and you can exchange value cleanly, basically contracts over data, over machine learning systems use of different data."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "I don't know, do you talk to machine learning folks that use ideas of smart contracts or is that for outside of your interest?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Because it seems like exceptionally applicable set of, when we talk about different services that might be created and revolutionized by smart, especially hybrid smart contracts, I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me in all industries."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "I don't know if you've gotten a chance to interact with those folks, with those services."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "I think what you're talking about is more data marketplaces in the data marketplace side of things."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "Well, this is actually once again, very applicable because there's a trust issue."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "At the end of the day, let's say I'm trying to sell you some data."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "You don't know the quality of the data."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "So you don't know what you wanna pay for it."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "And I can't give you the data for you to determine the quality because I've given you the data, right?"}, {"time": 5410, "text": "We need an autonomous impartial agent."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "We need an impartial computational kind of agent and on chain smart contract with an Oracle network to assess my data to write, to basically take random cross section samples of the data, assess it for quality, assess it for signal from the algorithm you have, which you don't wanna share with me because you don't wanna know the algorithm you're working on, right?"}, {"time": 5437, "text": "You don't want me to know what you want the data for."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm, keeping it private from me and takes my data, keeping it private from you, assesses it on a random cross section sampling for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you, allows you to determine a price."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And now both you and me know that we've arrived at a fair price for the quality of my data for what you wanna do with it."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And that's once again, from what I've seen in the data marketplaces, which are full of people who want that data for these learning models, often for financial markets, often for other reasons, this is their fundamental problem, which amazingly enough, there's a trust issue that is getting solved."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "And I think you can see even on the face of it, once that trust issue is solved, those markets can work a lot better, right?"}, {"time": 5496, "text": "I don't need to know your algorithm."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "You don't need to know my data."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "We both know that the autonomous agent is not under either of our control and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And we're all very comfortable with that."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "I could even make conditions that your algorithm isn't analyzing the data for something I don't want you to analyze it for, or you could make conditions that the data has to have any number of properties."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "And once again, you haven't leaked any signal to me and I haven't leaked any data to you, which is once again, just another type of trust issue that all of this solve."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "So it's the same pattern."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "If you work in this industry long enough, or if you really look at these use cases long enough, you'll simply come to the question, and this is the useful question, what is the trust issue this is solving?"}, {"time": 5544, "text": "And then if you can get an answer to that question on a case by case basis, that's when you'll understand why blockchains are relevant."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "And then once you do that with enough use cases, it becomes a little bit mind blank."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "You've mentioned trust quite a bit."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "You also mentioned trust minimization in the Chainlink White Paper."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "Can we dig into trust a little bit more?"}, {"time": 5571, "text": "What is the nature of trust that you think about in these smart contracts?"}, {"time": 5576, "text": "What is trust minimization?"}, {"time": 5578, "text": "How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?"}, {"time": 5583, "text": "I think it's important maybe to have a conception of what the alternative is, right?"}, {"time": 5587, "text": "What is highly reliable trust minimized off chain and on chain computation and alternative to?"}, {"time": 5594, "text": "So this is just kind of how I see the world in these two camps."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "One camp is the traditional, what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And this is the world as pretty much most or all people know today."}, {"time": 5609, "text": "This is the world where there's a bank logo or an insurance company logo, or some kind of logo."}, {"time": 5614, "text": "There's a very big building with marble arches and columns, it's the biggest building in the town."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "It's bigger than the church."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "And everybody feels very good."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "Everybody's got such a nice logo."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "It's such a big building."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "Why don't I give them my money?"}, {"time": 5627, "text": "Why don't I interact with them on the basis of any kind of agreement?"}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And that is definitely better than that not being there."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "And that is definitely a huge improvement for how people conduct commerce."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "Letters of credit from branded entities are very important for global trade to take place in the early stages of global trade."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "So that's good, but it is fundamentally just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood or somebody else suddenly has to change, well, it changes and you can't really do anything about it."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "You won't be able to change anything about what happened there."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "There's some long terms of service."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "There's some other agreements around all this stuff."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "At the end of the day, that's the brand based and paper guarantee world where it's all very vague and opaque and you're kind of hoping for the best because there's a nice logo."}, {"time": 5685, "text": "It's been around a hundred years."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "There's a lot of marble."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "Put a lot of marble."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "Big building, lots of marbles."}, {"time": 5690, "text": "This is why banks have such nice buildings, right?"}, {"time": 5693, "text": "It's not because they want to spend money on buildings."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "It's to create confidence in them as an entity in order for people to transact through them, right?"}, {"time": 5703, "text": "This is why all these kind of go to cities that had gold rushes, go to cities that needed banking as a service in certain time periods, they're the most beautiful buildings at least in the United States."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "So this is the brand based paper guarantee model for which up until now, there has never been an alternative, right?"}, {"time": 5722, "text": "So up until now, if you had a bad experience with a bank or insurance company or some logo somewhere, you would only have one option."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "Your option would be to go across the road and down the block to another building with another color of marble and another set of agreements that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements, right?"}, {"time": 5743, "text": "Now for the first time, you have mathematical agreements."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "You have mathematically guaranteed encryption secured, decentralized infrastructure powered agreements, right?"}, {"time": 5756, "text": "This is really the shift."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "This is really the comparison and the alternative through which people should view all of this in my opinion, because there's once again, this conception that everything is fine, everything works very well."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "Well, it does, it works fine and very well as long as nothing goes wrong."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And then in the cases when things go wrong, which they pretty much invariably at some point do, then you find out that, well, you know, turns out they don't have to pay me or turns out I can't trade or turns out the ATMs can be locked up and only give me 66 euros per day, whether I'm a business or an individual, like what happened in Greece a few years ago, right?"}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And the reality is that once that becomes a strong enough kind of realization for people, I think they will all just migrate to mathematically guaranteed contracts because why wouldn't you?"}, {"time": 5809, "text": "So in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts, kind of how do we, and cryptographically secured and decentralized infrastructure powered, how do we evolve into that world?"}, {"time": 5821, "text": "Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus, right, it comes down to a collection of independent nodes, a collection of provably independent computing systems arriving at the same conclusion impartially."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "That conclusion might be the transaction is valid between address A and address B, address A has one Bitcoin, wants to send it to address B, now address B has one Bitcoin, right?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So that's one degree of validation."}, {"time": 5852, "text": "It has certain cryptographic primitives that are used, certain levels of cryptography, encryption, and other methods that basically provide clarity and those guarantees."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "But fundamentally, it's this level of consensus that multiple independent computing systems came to the same conclusion, verified that conclusion and created a sense of finality, created a final state that is globally considered to be the state of a transaction."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "And that is how it's achieved, right?"}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So it's achieved by users looking at these mathematical contract systems and saying, you know, if I have money in a bank, there's one single person who controls that money, that's the bank, they could choose to give me my money or choose not to give me my money."}, {"time": 5928, "text": "So, you know, that's one example."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "Another example is, hey, we have a hybrid smart contract for something like crop insurance."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "I, as the user, evaluate where this smart contract runs."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "Oh, wow, the smart contract runs on Ethereum."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "Great, thousands of nodes, lots of computational security, hash power, so on and so on."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "Then I look at, oh, well, what triggers the contract?"}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Oh, there's this Oracle network."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "Okay, it's composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes, gets data from five different weather stations."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "You know, I'm comfortable with that."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "I have a certain level of comfort with that hybrid smart contract and its ability to provide me consensus about the transaction once the contract knows what's happened, and I'm comfortable with the consensus around the event that controls the contract, right?"}, {"time": 5976, "text": "Because once again, that event is what determines what happens with the contract."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "And if the contract is super well written, it doesn't matter if the event isn't reliable, right?"}, {"time": 5987, "text": "So now I've made this determination."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "I've gotten all this clear, transparent information about this system that combines the contract code with a decentralized Oracle network."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "And I've made my decision to participate in this decentralized insurance, kind of crop insurance policy."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "I've sent the Bitcoin or the stable coin or whatever I have on my Android phone."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "And then time goes by and let's say it doesn't rain, lo and behold, the smart contract returns the relevant amount from the policy back to me."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "I continue my life as a farmer."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "And by the way, the fact that that happened contributes reputation and contributes proof back to both the contract as something that can prove to other people that it has settled and the Oracle network as something that can prove that it has properly assessed reality or properly triggered a contract."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "And this is where there's one of many network effects where the more that smart contracts and Oracle networks are used, they themselves generate this immutable on chain data that proves their value and reliability."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "And improving more and more of that in more and more kind of use cases and more and more variants of the same contract, they arrive at a greater body of proof that they like, I am the decentralized crop, the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance used by a million users."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And my failure rate is non existent or really

made useful or secure or anything else."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And so I think that's the point of view that I have."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "Now, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto, would you tell me?"}, {"time": 7078, "text": "Because you said they shouldn't, whoever Satoshi is, you should keep that private."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "So would you tell it to me or no?"}, {"time": 7088, "text":

weird stuff."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "And so realistically, I don't think it would help anybody or even the person who discloses it, but just to be clear, I am not."}, {"time": 7122, "text": "And

it just is what it is?"}, {"time": 7188, "text": "I think at the end of the day, results speak for themselves and Bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry and has had an amazing impact on the world."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "And I think the result is still that Bitcoin is very widely adopted and driving the adoption of our industry in many ways."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "So I think it's very difficult for people to say that Bitcoin maximalists don't have something that they can latch onto and say, hey, there's something very real here."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "I think there's been decisions made by the Bitcoin community and the people who made the Bitcoin protocol to focus it on Bitcoin and to focus it on the kind of storing of the ledger of Bitcoin and the information about Bitcoin and the transaction of Bitcoin and to focus on securing that."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "And I understand why that decision was made to a certain degree, right?"}, {"time": 7238, "text": "It was about focus."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "It was about getting something worthwhile right without adding additional features and additional risk."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "And that decision is a decision that was made and has kind of the benefits of focus and the benefits of a certain amount of security and a certain amount of guarantees around Bitcoin and what that is and the value of that."}, {"time": 7264, "text": "And then it has certain limitations as a consequence of doing less or having the system hold data that isn't related to Bitcoin or not having the system hold contractual outcomes or smart contract code."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "So I think it's just kind of a decision, right?"}, {"time": 7281, "text": "And I understand why they're excited and I'm very excited."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "I started in this industry going to Bitcoin meetups and I met a lot of fantastic people, libertarian people that wanted to see the world work differently and shared a lot of my beliefs and a lot of my points of view."}, {"time": 7297, "text": "And so anyone who's been in the industry as long as I have has had to come from the Bitcoin ecosystem by virtue of kind of starting out that early."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "So I have an unbelievable amount of respect and admiration and gratitude for Bitcoin and that it exists and everything that it's done and that it birthed this industry."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "There's absolutely no doubt about that."}, {"time": 7321, "text": "At the same time, whatever design decisions people make are the design decisions they make, right?"}, {"time": 7327, "text": "And so if you've made a design decision that this ledger and this thing will be about Bitcoin, it won't be about colored coins, it won't be about op return at 80 bytes, it won't be about these other kind of nuances that you don't want this to be about, then that's fine."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "That's fine and that's a logical decision and it's called focus."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "And focus has a lot of value and a lot of great technology products have focused on something and done that."}, {"time": 7356, "text": "And then there's a lot of smart people around Bitcoin building kind of additional systems that anchor their security within Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "And I think that's an interesting approach that could bear fruit."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "I think it'll eventually require an interaction with a Bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways."}, {"time": 7374, "text": "And then there will be another question of, what is the design decision for Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 7378, "text": "Is it that Bitcoin will be just about the Bitcoin ledger?"}, {"time": 7382, "text": "Or does Bitcoin want to evolve into an anchor for all these other systems and maybe create additional data store, kind of more data on chain, on the Bitcoin blockchain related to that?"}, {"time": 7398, "text": "So I'm excited to see how that evolves, but until then kind of results speak for themselves and the results that Bitcoin has achieved for our industry and for itself as kind of the dominant cryptocurrency and the conception of our industry that people interact with first is obviously very important and something that I think really everybody in our industry is grateful for, right?"}, {"time": 7420, "text": "Because without

improve on that or try to make variants of that."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "From our point of view, we want to support smart contracts in all of their variations and in all of their use cases."}, {"time": 7546, "text": "So one of the things that I personally like about Chainlink is their ability or Chainlink's ability and the Chainlink network's ability to be useful to many different chains and across many different use cases."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "I'm personally a fan of Ethereum."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "Ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "Ethereum took us from a world where it literally took months to make a new smart contract by being forced to code it into a protocol."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "You had to go to the protocol developers and you had to say, hey, I need a DEX or I need some kind of smart contract."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "Put it in the protocol itself."}, {"time": 7579, "text": "Put it in the actual blockchain mining and kind of block generation, transaction generation protocol."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "That would take months or sometimes even over a year."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "That was a horrible experience and obviously very few people wanted to participate in that and so very few people made smart contracts, which I was not a fan of, right?"}, {"time": 7595, "text": "And then Ethereum came along and really did a lot of innovative things and introduced this approach to scriptable smart contracts where you could script all of these different conditions."}, {"time": 7606, "text": "And I found that fascinating before Ethereum."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "I found that fascinating once Ethereum arrived, I found it fascinating after Ethereum launched and I still find it fascinating."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "And I'm also very grateful to Vitalik and the Ethereum community and all the core developers there for taking our industry a step further."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "So I think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit for taking our industry from it takes months to make a really small smart contract to it takes weeks to make a relatively secure, relatively advanced piece of on chain code that anybody can script and people can do audits on and that's an unbelievable leap forward for our industry and I'm genuinely grateful to them for that."}, {"time": 7649, "text": "I think the next step in line with our body of work is how does that scriptable on chain code become more advanced in its interaction with all of the systems and events in the real world, which is in my opinion, the final missing piece of the puzzle, right?"}, {"time": 7668, "text": "So my body of work, the body of work that I'm involved in would not be where it is right now without Bitcoin by any measure."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "It wouldn't even be where it is now without Ethereum and the growth in smart contract development that they've created."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "We are excited and I am excited and the Chainlink community is excited and basically there's a lot of, I mean, for lack of a better word, excitement in seeing our industry graduate to providing more use cases, more usable hybrid smart contracts, right?"}, {"time": 7726, "text": "Because once again, it's absolutely amazing that Bitcoin created non governmental fiat money."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "It's an unbelievable innovation and invented decentralized infrastructure and birthed our industry."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "It's an unbelievably great achievement, an amazing achievement that we now have scriptable smart contracts through something like Ethereum."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "Once again, monumental achievement in my opinion."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "Once again, we still need to look to the future."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "You mentioned results speak for themselves and how design decisions have consequences."}, {"time": 7783, "text": "The Chainlink community have come up with a lot of brilliant designs."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "So how do you think through the design choices that you're facing where you can't predict the future, but you're trying to create a better future?"}, {"time": 7798, "text": "Is there something low level introspective advice that you can give or describe as to how you think through those decisions or high level how you think about those decisions?"}, {"time": 7816, "text": "And I think that actually gets to the core of what the Chainlink network is supposed to achieve."}, {"time": 7822, "text": "We are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "So once again, this is the big difference between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general and blockchains in my opinion."}, {"time": 7833, "text": "Blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible, right?"}, {"time": 7836, "text": "They say, here's my block size, here's the transaction types you can put in those blocks."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "Here's the contract language I have."}, {"time": 7846, "text": "Here's kind of my blockchain system, right?"}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Here's the fee structure for those blocks."}, {"time": 7851, "text": "They're gonna keep getting kind of composed, transactions are gonna get put into blocks, blocks will get connected and it'll continue, right?"}, {"time": 7858, "text": "And that's a very focused type of system."}, {"time": 7861, "text": "And that makes sense because it's focused on creating security for that category of on chain activity, which is once again, a critical, critical part of building a highly transparent system and something that Chainlink enables and doesn't compete with and just enables to do more."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "Oracle networks, conversely, have to interact with all the world's data and provide all the services that blockchains don't provide, right?"}, {"time": 7887, "text": "So there's kind of a spectrum."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains that are highly secure, highly reliable, highly tamper proof, highly transparent, but are not very feature rich."}, {"time": 7898, "text": "For example, they cannot talk to an API."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Many of them can't generate randomness."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "They cannot do some kind of privacy preserving computation."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "So they're very secure."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "And there are these kind of data structures and smart contract platforms to hold on chain code that can define conditions, receive value, pay value back out under conditions and create transparency around all that, which makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 7923, "text": "And then there's oracles and oracle networks."}, {"time": 7926, "text": "That is all the world's data, right?"}, {"time": 7928, "text": "We're talking about taking all the world's data and making it consumable for all the world's use cases that have trust issues."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive, right?"}, {"time": 7940, "text": "It's like the decentralized oracle network and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network needs to meet is gonna vary very widely from an insurance contract to a lending contract to an ad network contract to the data sales contract that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network to flexibly address all of those requirements is what's necessary."}, {"time": 7969, "text": "So flexibility is the goal, whereas with on chain like Bitcoin, flexibility is the enemy in the sense that you want security, you want the focus there."}, {"time": 7983, "text": "And in that kind of world, design decisions have huge consequences."}, {"time": 7988, "text": "And then if you look at the distributed oracle network side, you want to remove the restrictions of design choices."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "You want to provide maximal flexibility then."}, {"time": 7999, "text": "So it's a completely separate kind of a design framework."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "It's a slightly different problem, right?"}, {"time": 8005, "text": "Because we're not trying to define transaction types fitting into blocks on a certain timeline of those blocks being generated."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "We're trying to say, hey, there's this world of services or this world of data that's not very deterministic, but it's unbelievably useful to these smart contracts over here."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "And actually they need it to even exist."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "And we really want them to exist because once they exist, it's gonna completely redefine what our whole industry is known for, right?"}, {"time": 8028, "text": "And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg."}, {"time": 8031, "text": "They're like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "And so our goal is to create a framework and an infrastructure and a software that allows people to compose decentralized oracle networks, right?"}, {"time": 8044, "text": "So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network of seven nodes that goes to three data sources to trigger your contract worth a million dollars."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "And that's where you could start."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And then let's say your smart contract, your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars."}, {"time": 8059, "text": "Well, then you need to make some changes, right?"}, {"time": 8061, "text": "You need to go from seven nodes to 15 or maybe 31 nodes."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "And you need to go from three data sources to five or seven."}, {"time": 8069, "text": "And you maybe need to create some kind of what we call circuit breakers and some other checks."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "And you need to make sure that the decentralized oracle network comes to consensus around those checks."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "Because now the centralized oracle network isn't controlling a million dollars, it's controlling a billion dollars."}, {"time": 8085, "text": "And we have decentralized oracle networks that control well over a billion dollars, multiple billions of dollars."}, {"time": 8090, "text": "And we see them growing and getting more advanced data sources and more advanced features."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "And then if somebody else comes and says, well, I don't really wanna make a DeFi product, I wanna make crop insurance."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "And I have a completely different set of conditions."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "I want this method of consensus and I want data to be aggregated in this way, but not the way that you do for decentralized financial products."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?"}, {"time": 8110, "text": "We're supposed to tell them, no, our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that."}, {"time": 8115, "text": "And you can go and wait another five years until somebody builds it for you."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "That's not what we wanna do, right?"}, {"time": 8123, "text": "What we wanna do is be able to say, absolutely, here's an example of how somebody else made a decentralized oracle network for weather insurance."}, {"time": 8134, "text": "Here's a template, change that template, evolve it to meet your needs."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "And then someone else comes and says, hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?"}, {"time": 8144, "text": "I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events, or I wanna do whatever I wanna do with some kind of sports related data."}, {"time": 8152, "text": "Wonderful, here's the framework, here are your risk dynamics, here's a collection of node operators, here's a set of preintegrated data sources, here's a reputation system to assess the quality of your ensemble of nodes, here's a way to scale that up as the value in your contract scales."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "Here's all the tools that you need to build this contract."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "And what we actually see now as there are multiple types of computations and data sources that are provided by different decentralized oracle networks, of which there are now hundreds, we now see that a single hybrid smart contract might use multiple decentralized oracle networks."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "So there might be a hybrid smart contract that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network, a proof of reserve oracle network, a randomness oracle network."}, {"time": 8203, "text": "And I think we're gonna continue to see this dynamic that more and more advanced contracts compose various decentralized oracle networks into more advanced use cases."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "And this is the dynamic that we're focused on enabling."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "And I think it's actually a very virtuous cycle for everybody because the more of these hybrid smart contracts we enable on Ethereum and other blockchains, the more our industry provides real world outcomes to the market."}, {"time": 8235, "text": "To the larger world, which is at the end of the day, what I think everybody in our industry wants."}, {"time": 8241, "text": "Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts to become the way that global finance works, global trade works, global insurance products work, because they will inherently need both a blockchain on which the contract itself lives and an oracle network that powers all of the other interactions, right?"}, {"time": 8261, "text": "As a developer, how would you recommend somebody listening to this, but also me, to get started with smart contracts and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?"}, {"time": 8277, "text": "Well, for hybrid smart contracts, I'm gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "Please, let me twist your arm."}, {"time": 8286, "text": "I think you can go to our YouTube."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "We have a number of developer tutorials."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "Chainlink YouTube?"}, {"time": 8292, "text": "Yeah, Chainlink."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube, you should find it."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon where we had a huge amount of very kind of advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "Is that something that people can follow along like a video or there's web page traces of what happened?"}, {"time": 8315, "text": "Or is there a future actual hackathons that people could literally participate in?"}, {"time": 8319, "text": "There's plenty of more hackathons coming up."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "We wanna enable as many developers in web3 and web2 to build hybrid smart contracts as a way to redefine our industry and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "There are definitely gonna be more hackathons."}, {"time": 8334, "text": "So people should go and preregister or register on a list to get involved in that."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "That's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers and a lot of educational tools."}, {"time": 8341, "text": "They happen over a course of weeks, not days."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "So there's a long time for people to work on these things at the speed that they find comfortable."}, {"time": 8350, "text": "One, is there a kind of hello world entry point for hybrid smart contracts?"}, {"time": 8357, "text": "And two, on the hackathon side, what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?"}, {"time": 8362, "text": "Just kind of getting their feet wet in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled."}, {"time": 8368, "text": "I mean, there's unbelievable things that we see people building."}, {"time": 8372, "text": "I think how to get your feet wet, I think the hello world is probably DeFi because it's pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "And there's a large amount of data sources that we already have putting data on chain on test net, which is the test environment in which people would build."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree the most exciting for certain people and pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials and the amount of contracts to see how people have already built it."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "I think beyond that, we see people building amazing things at these hackathons."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "In the previous hackathon, we saw somebody build a smart contract that allows someone to rent out their Tesla."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access and rent out someone's Tesla on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating payment, which was kind of amazing."}, {"time": 8422, "text": "The more recent hackathon, we saw something called Dbridge, which is a cross chain solution that uses Oracle networks to confirm data on different chains."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "So I think the things that people build will just become expansive and varied in ways that I can't even imagine."}, {"time": 8440, "text": "But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list of different kind of winners in different categories."}, {"time": 8448, "text": "And there's so many different categories."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "We even have a GovTech category and a whole bunch of things."}, {"time": 8453, "text": "If people wanna see what's possible, they can go look at the winners."}, {"time": 8455, "text": "I think that's probably a good idea."}, {"time": 8459, "text": "Yeah, that'll be on the side of the hackathon."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "There's a blog related to that, and we're gonna have more of these."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "And once again, our explicit goal is to take our industry into this world of hybrid smart contracts, which just benefits everybody."}, {"time": 8474, "text": "It makes more on chain activity."}, {"time": 8476, "text": "It helps provide real world value to the average person from all of this infrastructure period."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "And at the end of the day, I think that it just redefines what our industry is about through use cases, right?"}, {"time": 8489, "text": "Because if you only learn through our industry from the point of view of a single use case, like the NFT use case or some other use case, that's what our industry is about."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "And the more of these use cases that people can make available to the average person or to the FinTech world or to the insurance world or wherever, the faster our industry will not just be about Bitcoins or tokens, it will be about changing global finance, changing global insurance, changing global trade."}, {"time": 8518, "text": "And that's the change in the world that I and a lot of other people in this industry, I think, got into this for."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "Now it's funny, you've mentioned about, you've had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin and Ethereum as important technology that paved the way for the future."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "And you somehow did not mention one of the most profound pieces of technology, which is Dogecoin."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "What are your thoughts about this particular revolutionary technology?"}, {"time": 8546, "text": "And what are your thoughts about Dogecoin going to the moon, to Mars, and outside of the solar system?"}, {"time": 8552, "text": "I think Dogecoin is a very interesting kind of, probably closer to a social experiment than anything else."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "Isn't everything a social experiment?"}, {"time": 8562, "text": "Yeah, I guess that's fair to a degree."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "I think it's fascinating how that's evolved."}, {"time": 8569, "text": "I think the people that made it with certain goals in mind and then it's kind of taken on a life of its own."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "I don't fully understand exactly why it's taken on a life of its own at this point."}, {"time": 8581, "text": "I once again, I don't spend too much time thinking about different tokens and how they're evolving."}, {"time": 8587, "text": "I'm much more focused on the launching and..."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "The technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas."}, {"time": 8595, "text": "But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin is how technology that leverages social dynamics, that technology's ability to utilize fun and memes to spread."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "I think it's really interesting."}, {"time": 8611, "text": "I don't think it should be discounted as a..."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "I think I tweeted today something about like the fundamental force field of fun."}, {"time": 8621, "text": "That fun has an effect on the space time."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "So general relativity describes how mass and energy can curve space time."}, {"time": 8630, "text": "And I was just giving an example that when life is fun, it seems short."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "When life is not fun, it seems very long."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "So fun has a very similar effect on space time, like in curved space time."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "In that same sense, there is a power to the meme."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "And I think Dogecoin illustrates that."}, {"time": 8649, "text": "I think Elon is an example of somebody that uses Dogecoin."}, {"time": 8652, "text": "I don't know his philosophy in particular on this aspect, but he does use Dogecoin."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "But he does use it effectively to excite the world in a fun way about the possibilities of future technologies like cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "I think the Bitcoin world is very serious right now."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "We've spoken about Bitcoin maximalists."}, {"time": 8676, "text": "There is very little space for fun and joking in the Bitcoin world, but there's still a little bit of fun and humor left in the Dogecoin world."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "In that sense, I think it's exceptionally powerful to inspire, to excite, to be able to talk about stuff without the seriousness of financial impact that now certain cryptocurrencies have like Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "So I keep an eye on, I've previously mentioned that Dogecoin I think is a fascinating piece of technology because I do think cryptocurrency is much bigger than the technology that you focus on."}, {"time": 8723, "text": "There is also a social element that you also spoke to that's I think not quite yet understood and it's fascinating to watch, especially as it covalls with the different tools on the internet, the different social networks, social network mechanisms on the internet."}, {"time": 8742, "text": "So I'm a huge supporter of Dogecoin because I'm a huge supporter of fun."}, {"time": 8749, "text": "I'm fascinated to see how it'll work out."}, {"time": 8754, "text": "You think it'll go to the moon?"}, {"time": 8755, "text": "You think it'll be the first cryptocurrency to land on the moon?"}, {"time": 8759, "text": "I couldn't say."}, {"time": 8760, "text": "I haven't done the analysis as I've said before."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "I haven't done the analysis."}, {"time": 8765, "text": "Well, yeah, no matter what, I do hope we will get humans back on the moon and hopefully get humans on Mars soon."}, {"time": 8775, "text": "Dogecoin, Bitcoin or not."}, {"time": 8781, "text": "Let me ask you about books and movies."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "What books and movies in your life long ago when you were a baby Sergei or today had an impact on you?"}, {"time": 8796, "text": "Maybe you would recommend to others and maybe what ideas you took away from those books, movies, coloring books, children's books, blogs, whatever."}, {"time": 8809, "text": "Yeah, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "So I think one of the things that had a very big impact on me were Plato's dialogues and particularly Protagoras and Gorgias as some of the two initial ones."}, {"time": 8822, "text": "I think what Plato's dialogues do very well is they give people a clear picture of what dialogue looks like and what the assessment of information probably should look like, right?"}, {"time": 8835, "text": "And how the dissection and analysis of an idea is very important and how it can actually be taken in either direction."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "But at the end of the day that the process of eliminating kind of this fuzzy thinking and arriving at whether it's an external dialogue or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture of reality is actually very important."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "And so I think I'm very lucky to have read the dialogues when I was in my early teenage years and it had a very large impact on me because it kind of showed me that nobody knows what they're talking about."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "I would play out dialogues in my mind and I would engage in certain dialogues with different people."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "And what the Platonic dialogue showed me was kind of how to tell when someone has no clue."}, {"time": 8886, "text": "And a lot of people are very good at kind of say they have a clue, right?"}, {"time": 8892, "text": "Saying like, here's how the world works."}, {"time": 8894, "text": "Here's what you should do with your life."}, {"time": 8895, "text": "Here's what you should do with your time."}, {"time": 8896, "text": "Here's what you should do with your money."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "Here's what you should do with your attention."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "Here's what you should do with all these things."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "And I think the ability to evaluate information generally is something that is surprisingly under taught."}, {"time": 8911, "text": "I don't actually understand why there isn't a course in like high schools or universities that's just like, here is how you evaluate information."}, {"time": 8919, "text": "Here's how you engage in external dialogue and internal dialogue to arrive at an accurate picture of reality rather than the picture of reality that other people want you to have for their benefit most often, right?"}, {"time": 8930, "text": "And at the end of the day, I think that put me down a path to really try and understand."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Beyond that, I think biographies have had a very large impact on me."}, {"time": 8943, "text": "Plutarchs, Greek and Roman lives."}, {"time": 8945, "text": "After I read Plato, I started reading a bunch of stuff, Greek stuff."}, {"time": 8949, "text": "I was just like, these Greek guys, they really know how it is."}, {"time": 8952, "text": "They did this 2000 years ago and they still got it right."}, {"time": 8956, "text": "It's kind of this like a theory of time around them, the value of intellectual ideas, right?"}, {"time": 8961, "text": "If an intellectual idea has survived the test of time, it's much more valuable than the intellectual idea that I just came up with 10 minutes ago, I haven't told anybody and hasn't gone up against all of the kind of rebuttals."}, {"time": 8976, "text": "So what's your favorite, what would you say would be a most impactful biography that you've come across?"}, {"time": 8983, "text": "I don't think it was those Greek or Roman biographies because they were very far away."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "I think that probably one of the most impactful ones that I can remember recently is around Vanderbilt."}, {"time": 8999, "text": "And so Vanderbilt was this guy who basically, without that much of an education, he would invent or work with people to make these steamboats."}, {"time": 9010, "text": "And then he had a lot of acumen around creating certain monopolies, regardless of

systems going on."}, {"time": 638, "text": "And so each, we call the column in the cortex is about 150,000 of them, is a complete modeling system."}, {"time": 644, "text": "So it's a collective

sophisticated modeling systems, about 150,000 of them in each human brain."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And that's a total different way of thinking about how the neocortex is structured than we or

are auditory models, models that talk to models and so on, but they vote."}, {"time": 715, "text": "And so these things in the cortex, you can think about these columns as like little grains of rice,

774, "text": "But yet if I looked at the neurons in your brain, they're going on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off."}, {"time": 778, "text": "But the voting neurons are not."}, {"time": 783, "text": "The voting neurons are saying, we all agree, even though I'm looking at different parts of this, this is a water bottle right now."}, {"time": 786, "text": "And that's not changing."},

me."}, {"time": 795, "text": "That is not changing."}, {"time": 795, "text": "That's the only part I'm aware of."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I can't be aware of the fact that the inputs from the eyes are moving and changing and all this other tapping."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So these long range connections are the part we can be conscious of."}, {"time": 805, "text": "The individual activity in each column doesn't go anywhere else."}, {"time": 811, "text": "It doesn't get shared anywhere else."}, {"time": 811, "text": "There's no way to extract it and talk about it or extract it and even remember it to say, oh, yes, I can recall that."}, {"time": 825, "text": "But these long range connections are the things that are accessible to language and to our, like the hippocampus, our memories, our short term memory systems and so on."}, {"time": 830, "text": "So we're not aware of 95% or maybe it's even 98% of what's going on in your brain."}, {"time": 836, "text": "We're only aware of this sort of stable, somewhat stable voting outcome of all these things that are going on underneath the hood."}, {"time": 849, "text": "So what would you say is the basic element in the thousand brains theory of intelligence of intelligence?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Like what's the atom of intelligence when you think about it?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Is it the individual brains and then what is a brain?"}, {"time": 861, "text": "Well, let's, let's, can we just talk about what intelligence is first and then, and then we can talk about the elements are."}, {"time": 865, "text": "So in my, in my book, intelligence is the ability to learn a model of the world, to build internal to your head, a model that represents the structure of everything, you know, to know what this is a table and that's a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck lamp and all this to know these things."}, {"time": 887, "text": "I have to have a model of it in my head."}, {"time": 887, "text": "I just don't look at them and go, what is that?"}, {"time": 890, "text": "I already have internal representations of these things in my head and I had to learn them."}, {"time": 890, "text": "I wasn't born of any of that knowledge."}, {"time": 895, "text": "You were, you know, we have some lights in the room here."}, {"time": 895, "text": "I, you know, that's not part of my evolutionary heritage, right?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "It's not in my genes."}, {"time": 900, "text": "So, um, we have this incredible model and the model includes not only what things look like and feel like, but where they are relative to each other and how they behave."}, {"time": 909, "text": "I've never picked up this water bottle before, but I know that if I took my hand on that blue thing and I turn it, it'll probably make a funny little sound as the little plastic things detach and then it'll rotate and it'll rotate a certain way and it'll come off."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Because I have this model in my head."}, {"time": 924, "text": "So the essence of intelligence as our ability to learn a model and the more sophisticated our model is, the smarter we are."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Uh, not that there is a single intelligence, because you can know about, you know, a lot about things that I don't know."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And I know about things you don't know."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And we can both be very smart, but we both learned a model of the world through interacting with it."}, {"time": 942, "text": "So that is the essence of intelligence."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Then we can ask ourselves, what are the mechanisms in the brain that allow us to do that?"}, {"time": 946, "text": "And what are the mechanisms of learning, not just the neural mechanisms, what are the general process by how we learn a model?"}, {"time": 950, "text": "So that was a big insight for us."}, {"time": 954, "text": "It's like, what are the, what is the actual things that, how do you learn this stuff?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "It turns out you have to learn it through movement."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Um, you can't learn it just by that's how we learn."}, {"time": 959, "text": "We learn through movement."}, {"time": 964, "text": "We learn."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Um, so you build up this model by observing things and touching them and moving them and walking around the world and so on."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So either you move or the thing moves somehow."}, {"time": 971, "text": "You obviously can learn things just by reading a book, something like that."}, {"time": 976, "text": "But think about if I were to say, oh, here's a new house."}, {"time": 976, "text": "I want you to learn, you know, what do you do?"}, {"time": 981, "text": "You have to walk, you have to walk from room to the room."}, {"time": 981, "text": "You have to open the doors, look around, see what's on the left, what's on the right."}, {"time": 985, "text": "As you do this, you're building a model in your head."}, {"time": 989, "text": "It's just, that's what you're doing."}, {"time": 989, "text": "You can't just sit there and say, I'm going to grok the house."}, {"time": 994, "text": "You know, or you can do it."}, {"time": 994, "text": "You don't even want to just sit down and read some description of it, right?"}, {"time": 997, "text": "You literally physically interact."}, {"time": 997, "text": "The same with like a smartphone."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "If I'm going to learn a new app, I touch it and I move things around."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "I see what happens when I, when I do things with it."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So that's the basic way we learn in the world."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And by the way, when you say model, you mean something that can be used for prediction in the future."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "It's used for prediction and for behavior and planning."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And does a pretty good job doing so."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Here's the way to think about the model."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "A lot of people get hung up on this."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So you can imagine an architect making a model of a house, right?"}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So there's a physical model that's small."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And why do they do that?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Well, we do that because you can imagine what it would look like from different angles."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "Look from here, look from there."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "And you can also say, well, how, how far to get from the garage to the, to the swimming pool or something like that."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "You can imagine looking at this and you can say, what would be the view from this location?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So we build these physical models to let you imagine the future and imagine behaviors."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Now we can take that same model and put it in a computer."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So we now, today they'll build models of houses in a computer and they, and they do that using a set of, we'll come back to this term in a moment, reference frames, but basically you assign a reference frame for the palace and you assign different things for the house in different locations."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And then the computer can generate an image and say, okay, this is what it looks like in this direction."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "The brain is doing something remarkably similar to this surprising."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "It's using reference frames."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "It's building these, it's similar to a model on a computer, which has the same benefits of building a physical model."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "It allows me to say, what would this thing look like if it was in this orientation?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "What would likely happen if I push this button?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I've never pushed this button before, or how would I accomplish something?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "I want to, I want to convey a new idea I've learned."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "How would I do that?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "I can imagine in my head, well, I could talk about it."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I could write a book."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I could do some podcasts."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I could, you know, maybe tell my neighbor, you know, and I can imagine the outcomes of all these things before I do any of them."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "That's what the model lets you do."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "It lets us plan the future and imagine the consequences of our actions."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Prediction, you asked about prediction."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Prediction is not the goal of the model."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "Prediction is an inherent property of it, and it's how the model corrects itself."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "So prediction is fundamental to intelligence."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "It's fundamental to building a model, and the model's intelligent."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And let me go back and be very precise about this."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Prediction, you can think of prediction two ways."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "One is like, hey, what would happen if I did this?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "That's a type of prediction."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "That's a key part of intelligence."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "But using prediction is like, oh, what's this water bottle going to feel like when I pick it up, you know?"}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And that doesn't seem very intelligent."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "But one way to think about prediction is it's a way for us to learn where our model is wrong."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So if I picked up this water bottle and it felt hot, I'd be very surprised."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Or if I picked it up and it was very light, I'd be surprised."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "Or if I turned this top and I had to turn it the other way, I'd be surprised."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And so all those might have a prediction like, okay, I'm going to do it."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "I'll drink some water."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I'm okay."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Okay, I do this."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I feel opening, right?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "What if I had to turn it the other way?"}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Or what if it's split in two?"}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Then I say, oh my gosh, I misunderstood this."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "I didn't have the right model of this thing."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "My attention would be drawn to it."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I'd be looking at it going, well, how the hell did that happen?"}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Why did it open up that way?"}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And I would update my model by doing it."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Just by looking at it and playing around with that update and say, this is a new type of water bottle."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So you're talking about sort of complicated things like a water bottle, but this also applies for just basic vision, just like seeing things."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "It's almost like a precondition of just perceiving the world is predicting it."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "So just everything that you see is first passed through your prediction."},

reached the same idea is that every sensory input you get, not just vision, but touch and hearing, you have an expectation about it and a prediction."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Sometimes you can predict very accurately."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Sometimes you can't."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "I can't predict what next word is going to come out of your mouth."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "But as you start talking, I'll get better and better predictions."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And if you talk about some topics, I'd be very surprised."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "So I have this sort of background prediction that's going on all the time for all of my senses."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Again, the way I think about that is this is how we learn."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "It's more about how we learn."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It's a test of our understanding."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Our predictions are a test."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Is this really a water bottle?"},

on?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "That's not normal."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "I mean, that's fascinating that... Let me linger on this for a second."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "It really honestly feels that prediction is fundamental to everything, to the way our mind operates, to intelligence."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "So it's just a different way to see intelligence, which is like everything starts a prediction."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "And prediction requires a model."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "You can't predict something unless you have a model of it."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But the action is prediction."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So the thing the model does is prediction."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "But it also... Yeah."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "But you can then extend it to things like, oh, what would happen if I took this today?"}, {"time": 1313, "text": "I went and did this."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "What would be likely?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Or how... You can extend prediction to like, oh, I want to get a promotion at work."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "What action should I take?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "And you can say, if I did this, I predict what might happen."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "If I spoke to someone, I predict what might happen."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So it's not just low level predictions."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It's all predictions."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It's like this black box so you can ask basically any question, low level or high level."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So we started off with that observation."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's this nonstop prediction."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And I write about this in the book."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And then we asked, how do neurons actually make predictions physically?"}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Like what does the neuron do when it makes a prediction?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Or the neural tissue does when it makes a prediction."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And then we asked, what are the mechanisms by how we build a model that allows you to make predictions?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So we started with prediction as sort of the fundamental research agenda, if in some sense."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And say, well, we understand how the brain makes predictions."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "We'll understand how it builds these models and how it learns."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And that's the core of intelligence."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So it was the key that got us in the door to say, that is our research agenda."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Understand predictions."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So in this whole process, where does intelligence originate, would you say?"}, {"time": 1385, "text": "So if we look at things that are much less intelligence to humans and you start to build up a human through the process of evolution, where's this magic thing that has a prediction model or a model that's able to

about the origin of species."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So what is the origin of intelligence?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Well, we have a theory about it and it's just that, it's a theory."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "The theory goes as follows."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "As soon as living things started to move, they're not just floating in sea, they're not just a plant, you know, grounded

are."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "What we think has happened, and there's a lot of evidence to suggest this, is that that mechanism we learned to map, like a space, was repackaged."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "The same type of neurons was repackaged into a more compact form."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And that became the cortical column."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And it was in some sense,

right."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "But there's a lot of evidence supporting that story, this evolutionary story."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "The thing which brought me to this idea is that the human brain got big very quickly."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So that led to the proposal a long time ago that, well, there's this common element just instead of creating new things, it just replicated something."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "We also are extremely flexible."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "We can learn things that we had no history about."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And that tells it that the

something that wasn't universal."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "It came from something that was more specific."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "So anyway, this led to our hypothesis that you would find grid cells and place cell equivalents in the neocortex."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And when we first published our first papers on this theory, we didn't know of evidence for that."}, {"time": 1718,

the evolutionary origin of intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 1753, "text": "So our theory is that these columns in the cortex are working on the same principles, they're modeling systems."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "And it's hard to imagine how neurons do this."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "And so we said, hey, it's really hard to imagine how neurons could learn these models of things."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "We can talk about the details of that if you want."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "But there's this other part of the brain, we know that learns models of environments."}, {"time": 1776,

much more likely the brain's using the same mechanism, which case it would have these equivalent cell types."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "So it's basically the whole theory is built on the idea that these columns have reference frames and they're learning these models and these grid cells create these reference frames."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So it's basically the major, in some sense, the major predictive part of this theory is that we will find these equivalent mechanisms in each column in the neocortex, which tells us that that's what they're doing."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "They're learning these sensory motor models of the world."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "So we're pretty confident that would happen, but now we're seeing the evidence."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "So the evolutionary process, nature does a lot of copy and paste and see what happens."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "There's no direction to it."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "But it just found out like, hey, if I took these elements and made more of them, what happens?"}, {"time": 1831, "text": "And let's hook them up to the eyes and let's hook them to ears."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And that seems to work pretty well for us."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Again, just to take a quick step back to our conversation of collective intelligence."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Do you sometimes see that as just another copy and paste aspect is copying and pasting these brains and humans and making a lot of them and then creating social structures that then almost operate as a single brain?"}, {"time": 1864,

how the neocortex works."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "We can argue how essential that is to understand the human brain because it's not the entire human brain."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "You can argue how essential that is to understanding human intelligence."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "You can argue how essential this is to sort of communal intelligence."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Our goal was to

to you?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Well, obviously, again, I mentioned again in the beginning, it's about 70 to 75% of the volume of the human brain."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So it dominates our brain in terms of size."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Not in terms of number of neurons, but in terms of size."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Size isn't everything, Jeff."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "I know,

right?"}, {"time": 1959, "text": "Our emotional states, our body regulating our body."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So the way I like to look at it is, can you understand the neocortex without the rest of the brain?"}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And some people say you can't, and I think absolutely you can."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It's not that they're not interacting, but you can understand."},

is."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Also, when you put the computation together with the connectivity at the same time, you're gonna see a lot of advancement of artificial intelligence happening closer or at the device."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Look, it's a very, I have a simple way to describe it."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Remember in the beginning of this conversation, we talk about in the 4G era,

have to be 40, 50 years old and have PhDs."}, {"time": 415, "text": "And then I was like, okay, this is really cool."}, {"time": 418, "text": "I wish we did that with programmers where we treated them like artists."}, {"time": 422, "text": "We would know the backstory these days today."}, {"time": 425, "text": "Or not just programmers, engineers."}, {"time": 427, "text": "Engineers, designers."}, {"time": 429, "text": "Yeah, like all the things about a product that I think we love are the little details."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And there's probably a human being behind each of those details that had their little inkling of genius that they put in."}, {"time": 442, "text": "I wish we knew those stories."}, {"time": 444, "text": "That's always sad to me when I, because obviously I love engineering and I interact with companies and they, you know, autonomous vehicles, something I'm really interested about."}, {"time": 453, "text": "And I see that companies generally, and we'll probably talk about this, but they seem to want to hide their engineers."}, {"time": 459, "text": "Like engineers hold the secrets."}, {"time": 462, "text": "Like the great secret, we did not speak of the great secret."}, {"time": 467, "text": "But then the result of that is you don't get to hear their stories."}, {"time": 472, "text": "The passion that is there behind the engineers."}, {"time": 476, "text": "Like, and also the genius, the little, there's a difference between the stuff that's patented, like the kernel of the idea and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects a little bit more, but sorry for the distraction."}, {"time": 493, "text": "So what, you mentioned Apple II."}, {"time": 495, "text": "What was the first computer you fell in love with?"}, {"time": 498, "text": "Like the product, the thing before you that was a personal computer?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "It was the Apple II."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over."}, {"time": 508, "text": "You know, it was, I think it was at the time, it was the, you know, the person of the year."}, {"time": 514, "text": "Maybe it was that year."}, {"time": 515, "text": "I don't remember what, but."}, {"time": 516, "text": "Well, Apple II was the person of the year?"}, {"time": 518, "text": "Yeah, for my magazine back in, I don't remember when, but it was around that same time."}, {"time": 523, "text": "I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools because my grandfather taught me about tools and creating things, right?"}, {"time": 533, "text": "And I saw this thing and I had the, you know, that IBM experience, that terminal experience."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "And so I need to have that at home."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And the only thing that was really talked about in our circles was the Apple II."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And I was just like, that's it."}, {"time": 548, "text": "So I went, jumped up and down."}, {"time": 551, "text": "It was very expensive."}, {"time": 552, "text": "I have to have this."}, {"time": 553, "text": "My parents were like, what?"}, {"time": 554, "text": "You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It was like crazy, right?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money as I can this summer."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And my grandfather said, cause he helped me learn all about tools and build things together."}, {"time": 569, "text": "I will match whatever you make so you can get this computer."}, {"time": 572, "text": "So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy."}, {"time": 576, "text": "Caddying actually for the, you know, the families in, you know, at the country clubs in the town where we lived."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And did whatever I could."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And you couldn't tear it away from me."}, {"time": 590, "text": "It was my friend."}, {"time": 591, "text": "It was everything."}, {"time": 592, "text": "From a product perspective, what do you remember that was brilliant?"}, {"time": 596, "text": "The design choices, the ideas behind it, or is it just that it exists?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "Or the very idea of a personal computer is the brilliant design choice."}, {"time": 607, "text": "Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I could program it anyways."}, {"time": 614, "text": "There was no, you know, there was no internet connection."}, {"time": 616, "text": "There was no, it was all just you."}, {"time": 618, "text": "You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?"}, {"time": 622, "text": "Or you created it yourself."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And then there was the whole other thing which was started happening, which we were doing."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff."}, {"time": 630, "text": "We were sharing software, right?"}, {"time": 632, "text": "So you built this community of sharing software."}, {"time": 634, "text": "You would go and pirate."}, {"time": 635, "text": "That was what it called, pirate all this software."}, {"time": 637, "text": "You'd never use it all, but it was just that fun thing of like, I'm gonna get all this other stuff and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it and see behind the scenes."}, {"time": 645, "text": "So you really had a sense this was your world and you owned it, right?"}, {"time": 650, "text": "And you could like literally go into every register."}, {"time": 652, "text": "We didn't have all those security layers."}, {"time": 653, "text": "Like we do not like, you could really touch bits and you could poke bits and you can make this light turn on."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And the geek assignment just lit up."}, {"time": 661, "text": "Now there's, it's so abstract."}, {"time": 665, "text": "People don't even understand."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Like usually some programs don't even understand memory."}, {"time": 669, "text": "They just think it's unlimited, right?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "And security, it's like, now there's all this security you should have, but it's like the adults all showed up to the party and now you can't have all the fun, right?"}, {"time": 681, "text": "It's like, no, no."}, {"time": 683, "text": "This was the thing where if you, if the power went out, you lost your whole program, you might've worked a whole day on it."}, {"time": 688, "text": "And if you didn't press save at every other line and you were to save, save, save, and it would like, the disk drive or the tape drive."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Like every single step was contemplated because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work."}, {"time": 705, "text": "So a lot of the magic was in the software."}, {"time": 707, "text": "The fact that you could have software, the fact that you could share software, the community around the software, it wasn't necessarily the hardware."}, {"time": 715, "text": "Well, that was the first step."}, {"time": 716, "text": "The second step around the hardware was I got things like the mocking board, which the mocking board paired with the music construction set, you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II."}, {"time": 729, "text": "So you would plug in this card and you go, oh my God, look at this."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And it would, you know, you could start generating cool sounds."}, {"time": 735, "text": "You know, like it was a Moog, you know, like a Moog in a way, early Moog."}, {"time": 740, "text": "What year are we talking about?"}, {"time": 741, "text": "This is 82, I think, 81, 82."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds that are very cool in the 80s."}, {"time": 750, "text": "Yeah, the 8 bit, you know, chip tunes, right?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick, you had to pull a chip out and you had to like plug in a dip socket to put in a joystick."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And then I was like, oh, and then I had to get more memory."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And now I wanted to speed up progress."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So then that turned into a company actually from that, but it was, and a hardware software went at that."}, {"time": 774, "text": "But it was all about, you know, modifying this thing in every way, first with software."}, {"time": 778, "text": "And then you started gaining confidence."}, {"time": 780, "text": "And then I got a little bit more money and stuff."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And then you could get into the hardware and, you know, wire things."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?"}, {"time": 789, "text": "So in the back, in the early Apple IIs, you could open up and all the schematics were there."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So you purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Yeah, it came with it."}, {"time": 799, "text": "That's an interesting choice."}, {"time": 801, "text": "That's an interesting choice from a company perspective."}, {"time": 805, "text": "Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like this is."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Absolutely intentional."}, {"time": 814, "text": "This is for the cutting edge folks too, or especially for the cutting edge."}, {"time": 818, "text": "It was only the cutting edge."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It was geeks for geeks."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So we were like, oh, how did they make it?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "And then we got to learn through that."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Apple I did the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "It just Apple II became more packaged up and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "Came with basic and then, you know, so it was really, it was what we might think of as a raspberry pie today or something like that, but not with so much software."}, {"time": 841, "text": "It was literally, and all the chips were out there so you could inspect the buses and the, right?"}, {"time": 846, "text": "Cause everything was just broken out."}, {"time": 848, "text": "So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects and open source, like on GitHub, that you have the schematics there and it's kind of a product, but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Like we're going to release this to a small set of people, self selected, perhaps that are kind of the makers, the cutting edge folks, the builders, the at home engineers, like in some way, what Tesla is doing with the beta for the full self driving is kind of like that."}, {"time": 887, "text": "It's like selecting a group of people, but that has to do more with you, how safe of a driver you are versus how much of a tinkerer you are because you don't get to tinker."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do for really cutting edge technologies, especially you're interested in like hardware stuff."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Is that crazy?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Why don't more companies do that kind of thing, you think?"}, {"time": 910, "text": "I think back then it was about a community and serving that community of builders."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Now this is about people who want to take, get the experience and want it really simple and easy."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And they're like, and so there's the audience or they believe the audience is small who would value those other things that we're just talking about."}, {"time": 929, "text": "But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi and all of these other little boards, right?"}, {"time": 933, "text": "There's a whole world more than I've seen."}, {"time": 936, "text": "Like it's amazing what you can do now with these little kits and the software that's created."}, {"time": 943, "text": "And so there's a whole nother, I think another batch of makers and builders that are coming up through the ranks."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And if you, we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "They take these little boards, they hack them, then they print out parts on their 3D printer, assemble them and they create robots and what have you."}, {"time": 959, "text": "So I think it's happening."}, {"time": 961, "text": "It's just not as, you know, as, it's just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be, but it's there and it's really expanding around the world."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And that's really nice to see cause you know, it's a whole new generation who can, who are empowered."}, {"time": 977, "text": "I think there's a semi dormant genius amongst millions."}, {"time": 981, "text": "So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit."}, {"time": 983, "text": "It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised if it's several million Raspberry Pis that have been sold."}, {"time": 990, "text": "I think more than that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius, brewing of engineers who don't get to hear because they're not organized."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "I mean, we get to hear their inklings here and there."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities that are local and so on."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "But if they were organized, if a leader would emerge, no."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Okay, so when did you first start to dream about building your own things, designing your own products, designing your own systems and software and hardware?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Well, in high school, there was a company that a friend of mine founded and I was the second employee, it was called Quality Computers."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And it was a mail order, mail order cause there's no eCommerce then, there was no internet again."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "You either mailed in your little coupon and you said, this is what I wanted to order or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Turn around time and this stuff was like, from the time you wanted, the time you bought it was maybe eight to 12 weeks."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "That was just the normal way of getting things."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too and it was software and all kinds of accessories."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So hardware accessories, so hardware, plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "And what we noticed was there were accelerators or memory cards."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And to be able to use those cards, you had to actually go and change the software you use to access this new memory."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So you literally had to go and you took the program that you had, let's say it was Apple works, which was like an early Microsoft office or something like that."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And you had to literally change the code and you would install all these patches to then take advantage of the hardware."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "So what we started creating was software on top of it to do the automatic installation of all of these patches."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So we made it much easier to take new hardware and the existing software you have and expand it into this new world."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So it was creating tools and the really great customer support."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And we started getting a lot of orders because we had the software make it easier to install, to give them the superpower."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "And at the same time, they would be able to change their software and have a new world that wasn't existing from the companies that were creating the initial products."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And so it was more of that."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And then that happened with hard drives."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II to like read, because you could get really fragmented."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So I wrote that piece of software and we sold that through the company along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So that all happened in 12th grade, freshman year of college."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade for the Apple II."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Between 12th and freshman year."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "What programming language do you remember?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Is it assemblies?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "There were certain inner loops were assembly and other loops actually there were really early Pascal, no C compilers."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "What was the motivation behind these?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "Is it to make people's lives easier?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Is it to create a thing experience that is simpler and simpler and simpler, thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Or did you just like to tinker?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "No, no, no, it was two things really."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware and software."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And then the other thing was, because I was also manning the customer support line, people would call in and go, this doesn't work."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware and the installation process better."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "So my whole world was out of box experience from when I was in high school."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Cause I had to man the customer support line, pack the boxes and write some of the code while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason, who was the founder of Quality Computers, he was off doing the mark, the ads, placing the ads for the mail order, making sure we were running the credit cards, right?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "It was two of us."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And then it turned into a third, and then we hired another person from high school to like pack boxes so I could stay on the customer support line or doing the software, right?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And it was all in his parents basement, right?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "As you were scaling exponentially."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So we'll jump around a little bit, but what were the, you said you love music."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod if we jump forward and how far back do those ideas stretch?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "If you look at the history of technology, there's, I mean, not just the product, but the idea is truly revolutionary."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Maybe it's time has come, but just if you look at the arc of history, sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And to be able to put that in your pocket, make it truly portable is fascinating in a way that's truly portable."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman or something like that."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?"}, {"time": 1309, "text": "You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Just loved music from, I think, second grade when I got my first albums and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "What kind of music are we talking about?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So this was Led Zeppelin."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, Stix, Ted Nugent, just the real American and British rock and roll, right?"}, {"time": 1339, "text": "There's a bunch of people listening right now."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Led Zeppelin?"}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Is that some kind?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "It drove my parents crazy."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "You just blasted loud."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Loud, just brr."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And this was second, third grade, fourth grade."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I just fell in love."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And then we moved back to Detroit and I loved listening to the radio station because there was all kinds of crazy music because you'd have an amalgam of rock and then funk and R&B and I loved to listen at night."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "So I had a clock radio."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But if I had the clock radio on, everyone, parents would go, go to sleep."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Turn that stuff off."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So I said, oh, they're like, okay."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And then I could listen to it all night and no one could hear me, right?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And I could just sit there and, you know."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Just huddling around the radio."},

conversation was, well, we went through it, the presentation and all that stuff happened."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "And he was just like, and he never, he would flip through it real quick, throw the presentation aside and said, okay, let's talk about this, right?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "And so we went through it all."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "And one was a big conversation about Sony."},

took me four weeks to finally sign on to join Apple after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting, was because I had built other things in the past at Phillips, the Nino and Velo, but they didn't know how to sell it or market it."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "They didn't know how to retail it, right?"}, {"time": 2501, "text": "So I was like, we could build this."}, {"time": 2502, "text":

on the Mac."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And he looked at me and he goes, you build this with, you know, a team and our team and Apple and this and this and the me, right?"}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And I dedicate that we will make sure that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars will only go to this product and nothing else."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "Right, Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "So Steve saw something special here."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Exactly, and he said, I'm going to commit all the marketing dollars if you can deliver the experience that we're all talking about, if we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well, because iPod would have never happened without iTunes."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "You know, people don't understand that was a bundle."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "So Jeff and I were, you know, if Jeff and you can present and bring that experience to life, I will put all the marketing dollars behind it."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of, what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?"}, {"time": 2573, "text": "iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And so Jeff Robin had his company, oh man, I can't remember the name, but it was bought."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps like Winamp and other things that were on the PC, real player, and Steve saw that going on and saw that Jeff and his small team had this, I can't remember, sound something."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes and then Jeff ran all of iTunes."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "And so what happened specifically there was they were starting to hook up to all these third party MP3 players because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man, like Walkman, but MP man, all these, and they were trying to hook them up and they were like, these are horrible experiences."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And through that, and they said, iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base because we were trying to get more on the Mac."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "So this program would be a great new thing you could add to the Mac."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And there was also internet connectivity at the time for the iMac."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And so they did that and then they're trying to do these hookups."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "They weren't going well."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And that's when they said, we need to build our own."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Or Steve said, we need to build our own since these are such horrible experiences."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "People don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "We need to get that music on the go, but

it, develop it."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "And then at the end, they call in marketing and say, now tell a story about this and let's get it out to the world, okay?"}, {"time": 3103, "text": "What happens then is marketing is like, well, why do people need this?"}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Tell us why people need it."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And so they create a story around this product, but the product was born out of what's, not why's."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story and it turns out to be a fictional story usually."}, {"time":

messages that product marketing creates, like those are the deep messages, like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "And then marketing turns that into something that's with creative and everything and brings that message across."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "Maybe it doesn't say that, but it comes maybe visually or some other way."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "So product management does that and holds that press release along the route and making sure that we're tracking."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And then also marketing is tracking with that press release to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Because they can also add extra adjectives or something, and then the product can't deliver that."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "It's like, no, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Keeps everybody in check."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws."}, {"time": 3442,

3448, "text": "Typically that's the founder, right?"}, {"time": 3450, "text": "In the beginning."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "And then over time you hire a product management team to then really watch over this the whole way."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "And they are talking to customer support."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "They're talking to engineering, they're talking to design, they're talking to sales and marketing."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "And they are always in the mix."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And it's the hardest thing to hire for."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "Ooh, yeah."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "So they have this very important job of developing and maintaining the why."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "Why is it the hardest to hire for?"}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Because you have to understand, first, nobody reports to you."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "You're alone."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "So you're alone and you have to build great ties with all of these different functions."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "You have to understand what they do, be empathetic with what they do."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And you have to project the customer's empathy or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And so that they learn more."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "They're not just doing, but they learn about the customer's point of view and sit in there and stand in their shoes to be able to then make better decisions on the engineering details or the operational details, customer support details."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "So they understand that if they're not the customer that it's intended for, they start to live through their eyes and see through their eyes of that customer so

"text": "Now, that makes sense except in this modern world, authenticity is extremely valuable and revealing the beauty that is in the engineering, the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas, I think requires throwing caution to the wind to some degree."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "And I just find that, boy, to push back on myself, I think it's an extremely difficult job because people hold you responsible if you're doing communications when you take risks."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And especially when they fail."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "So it's a difficult job, so I understand why people become cautious, but to me, communications is about taking big risks and throwing caution to the wind at its best because your job is to communicate in the long term, communicate the genius, the joy, the genius of the product."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And that sometimes is a tension with caution."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "Sorry, so because I've gotten the chance to meet a lot of very interesting people and interesting engineering teams and so on, I look at what they're doing and I look at what's being communicated and it's just, there's a mismatch because the communication is a lot more boring."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "It's like, there's something very like, just straight up boring about the way they're communicating because of caution."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "Okay, you

gonna be even more, if you have a conservative messaging leader, you're gonna have an even more conservative communications department."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "Because they wanna keep their

said, oh, we're gonna have a glass or a plastic, a cover for the display."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "Cause the display was glass underneath it."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And then we all landed together on plastic."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "Okay, the original decision was plastic."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "And the reasons were, okay, we don't wanna make a mistake."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "Glass can break, you know, people drop them all the time."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "So we don't wanna have a fragile

stuff."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So we went down the road with plastic."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "When it was shown, when the product was shown at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic."}, {"time": 5915, "text": "We had just enough of them in the field at the time."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic."}, {"time": 5925, "text":

plastic."}, {"time": 5942, "text": "And it was like, oh, and you just looked and that was all you got."}, {"time": 5947, "text": "But then people said, well, what screen is, what covers on that, you know, reviewers who knew better, you know, it's plastic."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And they were like, really?"}, {"time": 5957, "text": "And so there was enough of a doubt there."}, {"time": 5960, "text": "And then when we started to do it, and then Steve changed the frame of reference of the question or of the result of what the customer would think."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And he was like, if we designed it with plastic, with plastic and it's in their pocket all the time and it gets scratched by coins, slightly scratched or by keys or something like that."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "That is a design problem."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "We need to fix the problem."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "That was our bad."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it

of that, of that failure."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "There's truth to that."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "Because then they were part of why it failed."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "Whereas the design, they didn't do anything wrong."}, {"time": 6013, "text": "It was just sitting in their pocket and it's scratching and that's normal use."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "Abnormal use has been dropped."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "And we're like, oh, now we get it."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "And so we all moved to that mindset when you framed the problem and the solution in that way versus the original framing where we all landed on plastic."}, {"time": 6034, "text": "So, and then he was unrelenting on that, but we all had moved and we had moved mindset and we understood the why and we marshaled together."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "And then by the end of June, and it was crazy, the mechanical product design teams sourcing, all of us, the partner Corning pulled together to make that happen because it was the right reason."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "So this, you look at these stories and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways, but that's not usually how it all happened of like one leader was, that's not how Steve was."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "Now I've seen leaders who are just pounding and just had no real empathy for the team and understanding the why."}, {"time":

just had a very strong opinion."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "Very strong opinion."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "But it was challengeable."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "It was challengeable and if you came with the right thing, you know, it was, you could modulate that, but you had to come with a team."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "It couldn't just be you."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "It had to become a team and data and to overcome because it was a very strong opinion."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "And there's personal quirks of character, like you said."}, {"time": 6106, "text": "Bad days and good days."},

get, I mean, I am distinctly aware that you cross lines often."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "There's like levels, right?"}, {"time": 6156, "text": "You know, you could, it has to do with language and how language is heard."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "You could swear."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "You could say stuff that

right?"}, {"time": 6177, "text": "But I'm not gonna take that personally."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "I understand what's being said."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And then I also notice that there's

know."}, {"time": 6190, "text": "That's what makes a great coach, a great leader, a mentor, you have to like factor all that in."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "But it just, there's something about just being an asshole and being passionate and really driven that sometimes you do cross lines."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And that's, I don't know what to do with that because it feels like it comes with the territory."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "Like you have, it seems like you can't just have a perfectly optimized."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "No, no, absolutely not."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "We're humans."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "We're humans, we don't have a program."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "Everyone's programmed the same way to react the same way to given stimulus, right?"}, {"time":

that."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "But that was one of those instances where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "So they said, okay, we're gonna make it a data

let me show you why, or we can do that."}, {"time": 6509, "text": "And then Steve would go, you can't do that."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "And you're like, oh, we can do that."}, {"time": 6512, "text":

because it's infectious."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "And that means maybe not ideas that come bubble up to the customer level, but inside the organization."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "People like they get rewarded for their ideas and say, that's a great one."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "Steve was always like, you give an idea and he would go, okay, I don't know."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "The next

"text": "And he literally threw that phone out of his hand as fast as he could, right?"}, {"time": 6997, "text": "Cause it was horrible."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "So there was the pain of we're not gonna partner."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "So if we can't partner with these guys, we have to become one of them to actually compete, to save the thing that is bringing Apple from that 15 years of malaise, right?"}, {"time": 7014, "text": "So then from that, we were made a prototype of an iPod plus phone, a classic with it was an iPod, but it had a phone inside with all the music and all the other stuff."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "And you use your headset, wired headset to do the audio, right?"}, {"time": 7032, "text": "There was another project at the same time cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store, iTunes video store for music videos and movies."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "And it would be a full screen iPod."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "So instead of the classic, the way

{"time": 7058, "text": "Think of maybe an iPhone, like you knew it, right?"}, {"time": 7061, "text": "And then there was a third project going on, not in, those two were going on in my team, but the third project going on was the multi touchscreen technology to drive a Mac tablet."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology, there was just way too much you had to change on the software and everything to be able to use a tablet, right?"}, {"time": 7086, "text": "We see this all the time."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "Like people are like, there's not enough tablet apps today that are modified for tablet."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?"}, {"time": 7092, "text": "So then they would just be Mac touch stuff."},

you take that technology, marry it with the full screen, that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod and the phone stuff we were working because the iPod phone with a rotary dial was just like a rotary phone."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "We couldn't make that interface work well for data input."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "You put those three together."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And now is where those three things that then created the form or the technology and the form inside what would become the iPhone, married with a bunch of low level software from the iPod and manufacturing software and drivers and communication stuff, combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "And I mean that in the best way."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little."}, {"time": 7149, "text": "It was totally, things were hacked out and changed and new code was inserted."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And it really was a whole set of things from all different places to make that first iPhone OS."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "And then there was another team working on the apps and then another team working on the design of how it looked overall between all that stuff."}, {"time": 7167, "text": "So all of those things came together to create what we know as the first generation iPhone."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And those are all probably fascinating engineering challenges."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And great teams like creating the Frankenstein OS."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "That's fascinating because you're simplifying and simplifying but then you're just pulling different stuff from, and you're basically inventing, I mean, they're probably not thinking of it that way, but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer."}, {"time": 7196, "text": "It really is Frankenstein."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Right, and you didn't have to run Mac software."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time, like Windows and stuff, they were like, we need to make sure it runs Excel and it runs Word or something like that in some reduced thing."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "This was like, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "This was born out of entertainment."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "So we didn't have to go and take all the same application, you know, all those other ones was about compatibility."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "This was about a whole new way of being."}, {"time": 7221, "text": "What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation of the iPhone, the sort of, the first iPhone, you know."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "Phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "Yeah, that you're going to sort of present, announcing three new products kind of thing and then saying that it's all in one."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "Just, this is a good example, one of the sort of historic presentations of a product."}, {"time": 7252, "text": "Clearly there's like some showmanship that works, some reason it works."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work, but it did in this case, it often did for Steve."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "What, like, how did that feel?"}, {"time": 7266, "text": "What part of the actually the design process was that presentation?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "In the early, because you said, should consider the why, the press release at the very beginning."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "Steve was doing that the entire time."}, {"time": 7281, "text": "He was working on that story from day one."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "And then he would look at our faces because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't, at least if you're working for him, wouldn't tell him what you really thought of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence outside of the organization."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "And see what they thought, right?"}, {"time": 7305, "text": "And they could give him feedback on it and they could really challenge him, but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And so when you see that, hmm, then he would modulate it and change it slightly and change it."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "So he was working during all of that time on the story and the storytelling, right?"}, {"time": 7321, "text": "And the whys, while we're working on that and helping us refine it, just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?"}, {"time": 7328, "text": "All the time working on that."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "So when he comes out on stage, he does something that every marketer is told not to do."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "Say these three things are now combined in one."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form of storytelling possible for marketing, right?"}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But it was the best one because it was all those pains."}, {"time": 7351, "text": "It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications and I want my internet browsing because I want it on the go so I can look up things because it was information."}, {"time": 7360, "text": "And when you were on the road, you had a laptop, you had an iPod and you had a phone that, and you had to carry all of these things with you at once."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "Now we're gonna solve that pain for you and put it all together."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "So he was just showing you the pain and beating that virus of doubt and going, it's now in this one magical thing."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "And he could come up and masterfully tell that story because he told it almost every day to all of these people inside very quietly."}, {"time": 7386, "text": "And then it was just, right?"}, {"time": 7389, "text": "It was like a Tony award winning play that had been worked on for 10 years."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "But also the human came through, the timing."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "It was all that, it was all of it."}, {"time": 7398, "text": "And of course he was dramatic at certain points and he would raise his voice and a wry smile or whatever it was."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "Right, that wry smile was magic."}, {"time": 7405, "text": "It was all those touches."}, {"time": 7406, "text": "He was an actor as well as a storyteller."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "But it was the truth, right?"}, {"time": 7412, "text": "The truth came through."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "It was a nonfiction story."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it for dramatic effect."},

things."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "But watching the design process of really, cause it was really a team that was about materials."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "It was about form."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "It was about colors."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "It was about these physical characteristics."}, {"time": 7476, "text": "When we talked about this earlier was design."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "What is design?"}, {"time": 7479, "text": "Design's everywhere, okay?"}, {"time": 7481, "text": "So what they were really focused on was form, how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics, the physical aesthetics."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And watching, going through that process, I learned so much in that process about how to do colors, how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves, and shadows, and how it would look, not just in your hand, but how it would look in the photograph you were gonna take for marketing, right?"}, {"time": 7514, "text": "So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it."}, {"time": 7519, "text": "It was all of those physical things around that and watching the process to get there, that was enlightening for me, right?"}, {"time": 7531, "text": "It opened my mind to go, oh, okay."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "Just like there's a process for all these other things, it wasn't just magic and you say, ha, ha, ha, there it is."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "It was really a process of refinement, you know, of opening the funnel at the beginning and refining down over time to get to that final, the final and selecting and doing the selection."}, {"time": 7553, "text": "And certain types you could, certain times there were opinion based design details."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "But a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs of what can we deliver in volume?"}, {"time": 7565, "text": "What can we do different things?"}, {"time": 7566, "text": "So you always had these constraints that you had to work with under."}, {"time": 7569, "text": "And sometimes they, and the team, not just I, would say, we need this."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "And we're like, we can't deliver that."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "But maybe we were able to work together to find different design characteristics and different implementation characteristics that could get to that point without what they were describing."}, {"time": 7587, "text":

interacted with, like Tesla is an example."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "Sometimes, you know, talking about curves, sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side to deliver a very specific kind of thing."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "And one question that comes up in my mind is like, well, how far should we go to try to deliver a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature, or in like whatever the form factor is, or the color of the material, when the cost is like 10X to deliver, not financially, but just like in effort, like how many problems to have to solve."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "Right, exactly, but you have to understand again the why behind it."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "And at Nest, when we had limited resources, you know, putting a screwdriver in the box, a custom designed screwdriver in the box, was born out of those experiences I had at Apple, and seeing how you can create something that's emotional, it's part of marketing, and it's part of the product experience overall, even though it seems extraneous."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "I went back and made the design team, and the mechanical team change some curves on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "And I said, they're saying these cost more, I said, it doesn't look right."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "There is a, but they're like, oh, well we had, I said, no, you're gonna go back, and you're gonna make that change, I told you we needed to do it, we had a better looking model, that is gonna get done, I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you, but we already had this discussion, and that's the way it's gonna have to be, and I'm sorry, but it is what it is."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "And you know, because it's better for the customer, and it looks better in the pictures, and all the other stuff."}, {"time": 7740, "text": "And then we did it, and it was great, and everyone agreed it was great at the end, but it was pain to get there."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "Those are where, those little details are where the magic comes out, right?"}, {"time": 7751, "text": "And if you don't do, if you don't take those pains and put in the love, the customer's gonna feel, it's gonna, they're either gonna feel the pain, or they're gonna feel the love, if you put it in, right?"}, {"time": 7763,

through, it works with, it's all wired for efficiency."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation, meaning that every time it has computed, and you probably know these things way better than me, every time it has computed one algorithm, it doesn't want to do it again."}, {"time": 8913, "text": "It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right?"}, {"time": 8917, "text": "And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it, but it has to be something new, meaning the new level of complexity for it to even be willing to reconsider."}, {"time": 8925, "text": "Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden what you have is these neurons in the back of your head, and they have created pathways, right?"}, {"time": 8933, "text": "So, and every time neurons have created pathway among themselves, because basically they're attached, and here is the pathway, well, this pathway in the world of, in the world of science of bias, it's a habit."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "In general, it's a habit when they form two pathways, when they form a pathway, it's a habit."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "Remember when I told you that

just like you said, brilliantly, it has a bunch of simplifications that's built up, and it uses those simplifications to get through the day."}, {"time": 9032, "text": "To get through the day, exactly."}, {"time": 9034, "text": "So then here you are, needing to make sense of a world, and then the brain is your best ally in that."}, {"time": 9039, "text": "The way it's gonna do it is through efficiency, efficiency done through automation."}, {"time": 9043, "text": "So every time it thinks it's figured something out, it's never gonna think about it again, so that's how you build all of these habits of unconscious bias, because everything, so it's somewhere along the line, you come up with the information that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger."}, {"time": 9061,

given that information."}, {"time": 9072, "text": "So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware, and the software it runs on is, what do you call it?"}, {"time": 9081, "text": "Is a cultural imprint."}, {"time": 9084, "text": "All of this information that we're getting from the Disney movies that you're reading, telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince and all of

even some black people who are gonna claim that they didn't visit up when they registered, really?"}, {"time": 9126, "text": "So the truth, so then when I learned all of this, I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got the brain, you've got biases, it comes with the territory, that makes sense."}, {"time": 9136, "text": "Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend that function of a brain and

9203, "text": "And so then you realize there's this whole thing that is now what you understand is that this problem is not about anti racism BS, but it is about can each one of us do the work where the work is needed, which is we look inside."}, {"time": 9218, "text": "Can we go for this work of deprogrammation?"}, {"time": 9222, "text": "This concept of a mindful practice of undoing the habit

whole thing of, it's the five step thing, bias awareness."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "This, basically at this level, what you're doing is you're learning to spot the biases in our culture, because that's where the cultural imprint comes from."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "You're watching this movie and you're realizing, just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again, the black person is

there, you see, it's very subtle."}, {"time": 9346, "text": "But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained to see things, I'm like, interesting."}, {"time": 9351, "text": "Or like when the media just says, froze climate change issue on something without even the choice of words."}, {"time": 9359, "text": "So it's pretty much everywhere."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "You open a book everywhere."}, {"time": 9363, "text": "The interesting thing though, I mean, even that man, woman example, is I think it's really powerful to bring that bias to the surface, but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is, make fun of it, bring it to the surface, like acknowledge the fact that those things are a part

is how, this is affecting how I think."}, {"time": 9406, "text": "We might like how that works, we might not, but we have to acknowledge it and not get, make it part of humor, make fun of yourself, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "And so that's why this first step is bias awareness."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "So you get, you train yourself, oh yeah, okay, that was one or it's, you know, and it's about, it's in you, we're talking about you, we're not."}, {"time": 9427, "text": "And then from there, you're like replace the bias, like bias replacement."}, {"time": 9433, "text": "Then it is where you practice the empathy."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel every day I walk into a store and the guy thinks he should be following me because maybe I might steal something because I'm black."}, {"time": 9445, "text": "Because once you try that, to put yourself in the other person's shoes, all of a sudden something else starts to click."}, {"time": 9451, "text": "And then from there, you go on to making connection."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "Then you're making a connection and then things start to change because now you know, you're making, then you make cultural immersion."}, {"time": 9465, "text": "So this is where we had some people like this one woman, she was very quite, very feminist oriented."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "And because for her it was like, how come you, how come, how come you just lower, you know, like how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself, not understanding everything else that comes with it."}, {"time": 9489, "text": "But through, as she understood that she even had that bias, then she went on through all the different processes."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And then eventually when comes the next step, cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know, they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting and then we break at night."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "And she started understanding very different things."}, {"time": 9512,

"text": "This is where that's it, your bias can go home now because it has been challenged with reality and understanding."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "And so for me, that is what I was after."}, {"time": 9531, "text": "And then, but then the world was just like, we don't want to be told we're part of a problem."}, {"time": 9535, "text": "So, but I still reckon that it is the type of

going to stop me from doing anything I want to do?"}, {"time": 9561, "text": "Is it going to make it harder?"}, {"time": 9562, "text": "But this is where, for anybody who is serious about making sure, about fighting racism, I think the only job you have to do is to make sure that people keep their sense of self agency and B, can you help provide people with the tools to stand up?"}, {"time": 9588,
