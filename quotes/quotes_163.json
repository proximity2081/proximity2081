on."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So it's very, very selective about what it looks at."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So let me try to give you an intuition about how you decide what to think about."}, {"time": 368, "text": "It's a combination of two things."}, {"time": 368, "text": "One is how promising it is."}, {"time": 374, "text": "So if you're already convinced that a move is terrible, there's no point spending a lot more time convincing yourself that it's terrible because it's probably not going to change your mind."}, {"time": 382, "text": "So the real reason you think is because there's some possibility of changing your mind about what to do."}, {"time": 394, "text": "And it's that changing your mind that would result then in a better final action in the real world."}, {"time": 400, "text": "So that's the purpose of thinking is to improve the final action in the real world."}, {"time": 400, "text": "So if you think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible, you can convince yourself it's terrible, you're still not going to change your mind."}, {"time": 413, "text": "But on the other hand, suppose you had a choice between two moves."}, {"time": 419, "text": "One of them you've already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw, let's say."}, {"time": 419, "text": "And then the other one looks a little bit worse."}, {"time": 425, "text": "It looks fairly likely that if you make that move, you're going to lose."}, {"time": 430, "text": "But there's still some uncertainty about the value of that move."}, {"time": 430, "text": "There's still some possibility that it will turn out to be a win."}, {"time": 436, "text": "Then it's worth thinking about that."}, {"time": 436, "text": "So even though it's less promising on average than the other move, which is a good move, it's worth thinking about on average than the other move, which is guaranteed to be a draw."}, {"time": 447, "text": "There's still some purpose in thinking about it because there's a chance that you will change your mind and discover that in fact it's a better move."}, {"time": 456, "text": "So it's a combination of how good the move appears to be and how much uncertainty there is about its value."}, {"time": 462, "text": "The more uncertainty, the more it's worth thinking about because there's a higher upside if you want to think of it that way."}, {"time": 472, "text": "And of course in the beginning, especially in the AlphaGo Zero formulation, everything is shrouded in uncertainty."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So you're really swimming in a sea of uncertainty."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So it benefits you to, I mean, actually following the same process as you described, but because you're so uncertain about everything, you basically have to try a lot of different directions."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So the early parts of the search tree are fairly bushy that it will look at a lot of different possibilities, but fairly quickly, the degree of certainty about some of the moves, I mean, if a move is really terrible, you'll pretty quickly find out, right?"}, {"time": 507, "text": "You lose half your pieces or half your territory and then you'll say, okay, this is not worth thinking about anymore."}, {"time": 517, "text": "And then so further down the tree becomes very long and narrow and you're following various lines of play, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 moves into the future."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And that again is something that human beings have a very hard time doing mainly because they just lack the short term memory."}, {"time": 542, "text": "You just can't remember a sequence of moves that's 50 moves long."}, {"time": 542, "text": "And you can't imagine the board correctly for that many moves into the future."}, {"time": 553, "text": "Of course, the top players, I'm much more familiar with chess, but the top players probably have, they have echoes of the same kind of intuition instinct that in a moment's time AlphaGo applies when they see a board."}, {"time": 566, "text": "I mean, they've seen those patterns, human beings have seen those patterns before at the top, at the grandmaster level."}, {"time": 571, "text": "It seems that there is some similarities or maybe it's our imagination creates a vision of those similarities, but it feels like this kind of pattern recognition that the AlphaGo approaches are using is similar to what human beings at the top level are using."}, {"time": 595, "text": "I think there's, there's some truth to that, but not entirely."}, {"time": 595, "text": "I mean, I think the, the extent to which a human grandmaster can reliably instantly recognize the right move and instantly recognize the value of the position."}, {"time": 610, "text": "I think that's a little bit overrated."}, {"time": 615, "text": "But if you sacrifice a queen, for example, I mean, there's these, there's these beautiful games of chess with Bobby Fischer, somebody where it's seeming to make a bad move."}, {"time": 620, "text": "And I'm not sure there's a perfect degree of calculation involved where they've calculated all the possible things that happen, but there's an instinct there, right?"}, {"time": 634, "text": "That somehow adds up to Yeah."}, {"time": 640, "text": "So I think what happens is you, you, you get a sense that there's some possibility in the position, even if you make a weird looking move, that it opens up some, some lines of, of calculation that otherwise would be definitely bad."}, {"time": 656, "text": "And, and it's that intuition that there's something here in this position that might, might yield a win."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And then you follow that, right?"}, {"time": 670, "text": "And, and in some sense, when a, when a chess player is following a line and in his or her mind, they're, they're mentally simulating what the other person is going to do, what the opponent is going to do."}, {"time": 683, "text": "And they can do that as long as the moves are kind of forced, right?"}, {"time": 689, "text": "As long as there's, you know, there's a, a fort we call a forcing variation where the opponent doesn't really have much choice how to respond."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And then you follow that, how to respond."}, {"time": 699, "text": "And then you see if you can force them into a situation where you win."}, {"time": 703, "text": "You know, we see plenty of mistakes even, even in grandmaster games where they just miss some simple three, four, five move combination that, you know, wasn't particularly apparent in, in the position, but was still there."}, {"time": 718, "text": "That's the thing that makes us human."}, {"time": 722, "text": "So when you mentioned that in Othello, those games were after some matter reasoning improvements and research was able to beat you."}, {"time": 729, "text": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"time": 734, "text": "Part of the meta reasoning capability that it had was based on learning and, and you could sit down the next day and you could just feel that it had got a lot smarter, you know, and all of a sudden you really felt like you're sort of pressed against the wall because it was, it was much more aggressive and, and was totally unforgiving of any minor mistake that you might make."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And, and actually it seemed understood the game better than I did."}, {"time": 763, "text": "And Gary Kasparov has this quote where during his match against Deep Blue, he said, he suddenly felt that there was a new kind of intelligence across the board."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Do you think that's a scary or an exciting possibility for, for Kasparov and for yourself in, in the context of chess, purely sort of in this, like that feeling, whatever that is?"}, {"time": 790, "text": "I think it's definitely an exciting feeling."}, {"time": 797, "text": "You know, this is what made me work on AI in the first place was as soon as I really understood what a computer was, I wanted to make it smart."}, {"time": 803, "text": "You know, I started out with the first program I wrote was for the Sinclair programmable calculator."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And I think you could write a 21 step algorithm."}, {"time": 815, "text": "That was the biggest program you could write, something like that."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And do little arithmetic calculations."}, {"time": 822, "text": "So I think I implemented Newton's method for a square roots and a few other things like that."}, {"time": 828, "text": "But then, you know, I thought, okay, if I just had more space, I could make this thing intelligent."}, {"time": 834, "text": "And so I started thinking about AI and, and I think the, the, the thing that's scary is not, is not the chess program because, you know, chess programs, they're not in the taking over the world business."}, {"time": 859, "text": "But if you extrapolate, you know, there are things about chess that don't resemble the real world, right?"}, {"time": 869, "text": "We know, we know the rules of chess."}, {"time": 875, "text": "The chess board is completely visible to the program where of course the real world is not most, most of the real world is, is not visible from wherever you're sitting, so to speak."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And to overcome those kinds of problems, you need qualitatively different algorithms."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Another thing about the real world is that, you know, we, we regularly plan ahead on the timescales involving billions or trillions of steps."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Now we don't plan those in detail, but you know, when you choose to do a PhD at Berkeley, that's a five year commitment and that amounts to about a trillion motor control steps that you will eventually be committed to."}, {"time": 919, "text": "Including going up the stairs, opening doors, drinking water."}, {"time": 926, "text": "I mean, every, every finger movement while you're typing, every character of every paper and the thesis and everything."}, {"time": 932, "text": "So you're not committing in advance to the specific motor control steps, but you're still reasoning on a timescale that will eventually reduce to trillions of motor control actions."}, {"time": 941, "text": "And so for all of these reasons, you know, AlphaGo and Deep Blue and so on don't represent any kind of threat to humanity, but they are a step towards it, right?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "And progress in AI occurs by essentially removing one by one these assumptions that make problems easy."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Like the assumption of complete observability of the situation, right?"}, {"time": 974, "text": "We remove that assumption, you need a much more complicated kind of computing design."}, {"time": 980, "text": "It needs, it needs something that actually keeps track of all the things you can't see and tries to estimate what's going on."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And there's inevitable uncertainty in that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "So it becomes a much more complicated problem."}, {"time": 991, "text": "But, you know, we are removing those assumptions."}, {"time": 996, "text": "We are starting to have algorithms that can cope with much longer timescales, that can cope with uncertainty, that can cope with partial observability."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And so each of those steps sort of magnifies by a thousand the range of things that we can do with AI systems."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "So the way I started in AI, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "I wanted to understand the mind in high school and of course program and so on."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And I showed up University of Illinois to an AI lab and they said, okay, I don't have time for you, but here's a book, AI and Modern Approach."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "I think it was the first edition at the time."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Here, go, go, go learn this."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And I remember the lay of the land was, well, it's incredible that we solved chess, but we'll never solve go."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "I mean, it was pretty certain that go in the way we thought about systems that reason wasn't possible to solve."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And now we've solved this."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "So it's a very... Well, I think I would have said that it's unlikely we could take the kind of algorithm that was used for chess and just get it to scale up and work well for go."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And at the time what we thought was that in order to solve go, we would have to do something similar to the way humans manage the complexity of go, which is to break it down into kind of sub games."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So when a human thinks about a go board, they think about different parts of the board as sort of weakly connected to each other."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And they think about, okay, within this part of the board, here's how things could go in that part of board, here's how things could go."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And then you try to sort of couple those two analyses together and deal with the interactions and maybe revise your views of how things are going to go in each part."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And then you've got maybe five, six, seven, ten parts of the board."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And that actually resembles the real world much more than chess does because in the real world, we have work, we have home life, we have sport, different kinds of activities, shopping, these all are connected to each other, but they're weakly connected."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So when I'm typing a paper, I don't simultaneously have to decide which order I'm going to get the milk and the butter, that doesn't affect the typing."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "But I do need to realize, okay, I better finish this before the shops close because I don't have anything, I don't have any food at home."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So there's some weak connection, but not in the way that chess works where everything is tied into a single stream of thought."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So the thought was that to solve go, we'd have to make progress on stuff that would be useful for the real world."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "And in a way, AlphaGo is a little bit disappointing, right?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Because the program designed for AlphaGo is actually not that different from Deep Blue or even from Arthur Samuel's checker playing program from the 1950s."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "And in fact, the two things that make AlphaGo work is one is this amazing ability to evaluate the positions, and the other is the meta reasoning capability, which allows it to explore some paths in the tree very deeply and to abandon other paths very quickly."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So this word meta reasoning, while technically correct, inspires perhaps the wrong degree of power that AlphaGo has, for example, the word reasoning is a powerful word."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So let me ask you, sort of, you were part of the symbolic AI world for a while, like AI was, there's a lot of excellent, interesting ideas there that unfortunately met a winter."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And so do you think it reemerges?"}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So I would say, yeah, it's not quite as simple as that."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So the AI winter for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And that came about because in the mid 80s, there was a really a concerted attempt to push AI out into the real world using what was called expert system technology."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And for the most part, that technology was just not ready for primetime."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "They were trying, in many cases, to do a form of uncertain reasoning, judgment, combinations of evidence, diagnosis, those kinds of things, which was simply invalid."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And when you try to apply invalid reasoning methods to real problems, you can fudge it for small versions of the problem."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "But when it starts to get larger, the thing just falls apart."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So many companies found that the stuff just didn't work, and they were spending tons of money on consultants to try to make it work."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And there were other practical reasons, like they were asking the companies to buy incredibly expensive Lisp machine workstations, which were literally between $50,000 and $100,000 in 1980s money, which would be like between $150,000 and $300,000 per workstation in current prices."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "And then the bottom line, they weren't seeing a profit from it."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Yeah, in many cases."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "I think there were some successes, there's no doubt about that."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But people, I would say, overinvested."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "Every major company was starting an AI department, just like now."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And I worry a bit that we might see similar disappointments, not because the current technology is invalid, but it's limited in its scope."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And it's almost the duel of the scope problems that expert systems had."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So what have you learned from that hype cycle?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And what can we do to prevent another winter, for example?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Yeah, so when I'm giving talks these days, that's one of the warnings that I give."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So this is a two part warning slide."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "One is that rather than data being the new oil, data is the new snake oil."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That's a good line."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And then the other is that we might see a kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And I think self driving cars would be the flagship."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And I think when you look at the history, so the first self driving car was on the freeway, driving itself, changing lanes, overtaking in 1987."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "And so it's more than 30 years."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "And that kind of looks like where we are today, right?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "You know, prototypes on the freeway, changing lanes and overtaking."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Now, I think that's one of the things that's been made, particularly on the perception side."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So we worked a lot on autonomous vehicles in the early mid 90s at Berkeley."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And we had our own big demonstrations."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "We put congressmen into self driving cars and had them zooming along the freeway."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "And the problem was clearly perception."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "At the time, the problem was perception."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So in simulation, with perfect perception, you could actually show that you can drive safely for a long time, even if the other cars are misbehaving and so on."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "But simultaneously, we worked on machine vision for detecting cars and tracking pedestrians and so on."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And we couldn't get the cars to do that."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And so we had to do that for pedestrians and so on."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "And we couldn't get the reliability of detection and tracking up to a high enough level, particularly in bad weather conditions, nighttime, rainfall."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Good enough for demos, but perhaps not good enough to cover the general operation."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So the thing about driving is, you know, suppose you're a taxi driver, you know, and you drive every day, eight hours a day for 10 years, right?"}, {"time": 1519, "text": "That's 100 million seconds of driving, you know, and any one of those seconds, you can make a fatal mistake."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So you're talking about eight nines of reliability, right?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Now, if your vision system only detects 98.3% of the vehicles, right, then that's sort of, you know, one in a bit nines of reliability."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So you have another seven orders of magnitude to go."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And this is what people don't understand."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "They think, oh, because I had a successful demo, I'm pretty much done."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "But you're not even within seven orders of magnitude of being done."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And that's the difficulty."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And it's not the, can I follow a white line?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "That's not the problem, right?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "We follow a white line all the way across the country."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "But it's the weird stuff that happens."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "It's all the edge cases, yeah."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "The edge case, other drivers doing weird things."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "You know, so if you talk to Google, right, so they had actually a very classical architecture where, you know, you had machine vision which would detect all the other cars and pedestrians and the white lines and the road signs."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And then basically that was fed into a logical database."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And then you had a classical 1970s rule based expert system telling you, okay, if you're in the middle lane and there's a bicyclist in the right lane who is signaling this, then you do that, right?"}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And what they found was that every day they'd go out and there'd be another situation that the rules didn't cover."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "You know, so they'd come to a traffic circle and there's a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around the traffic circle."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Okay, what do you do?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "We don't have a rule."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Oh my God."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Okay, stop."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And then, you know, they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really converging."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And if you think about it, right, how do you deal with an unexpected situation, meaning one that you've never previously encountered and the sort of reasoning required to figure out the solution for that situation has never been done."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "It doesn't match any previous situation in terms of the kind of reasoning you have to do."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Well, you know, in chess programs, this happens all the time, right?"}, {"time": 1666, "text": "You're constantly coming up with situations you haven't seen before and you have to reason about them and you have to think about, okay, here are the possible things I could do."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Here are the outcomes."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Here's how desirable the outcomes are and then pick the right one."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You know, in the 90s, we were saying, okay, this is how you're going to have to do automated vehicles."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "They're going to have to have a look ahead capability, but the look ahead for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because there's humans and they're less predictable than chess pieces."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Well, then you have an opponent in chess who's also somewhat unpredictable."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "But for example, in chess, you always know the opponent's intention."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "They're trying to beat you, right?"}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Whereas in driving, you don't know is this guy trying to turn left or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the channel on his radio or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "You've got to try and figure out the mental state, the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "And then you've got to figure out, okay, which is the trajectory for me that's going to be safest."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your trajectory and so on."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So, you know, they've got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where you're kind of racing a vehicle that's already on the freeway and you're going to pull ahead of them or you're going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty about who's going first."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "So all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making architecture that's very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an end to end neural network system."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So just as AlphaGo is pretty good when it doesn't do any look ahead, but it's way, way, way, way better when it does, I think the same is going to be true for driving."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "You can have a driving system that's pretty good when it doesn't do any look ahead, but that's not good enough."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And we've already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly designed machine learning algorithms that don't really understand what they're doing."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "On several levels, I think on the perception side, there's mistakes being made by those algorithms where the perception is very shallow."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "On the planning side, the look ahead, like you said, and the thing that we come up against that's really interesting when you try to deploy systems in the real world is you can't think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that responds to the world always."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "You have to realize that it's an agent that others will respond to as well."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "So in order to drive successfully, you can't just try to do obstacle avoidance."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "You can't pretend that you're invisible, right?"}, {"time": 1847, "text": "You're the invisible car."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "It doesn't work that way."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "I mean, but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "Just we're all, there's this tension, there's this game."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "So if we study a lot of work with pedestrians, if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance, so you're doing look ahead as in modeling the intent that they're not going to, they're going to take advantage of you."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "They're not going to respect you at all."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "There has to be a tension, a fear, some amount of uncertainty."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "That's how we have created."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "Or at least just a kind of a resoluteness."},

know how we want our future to go."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "And the machine, a machine that's uncertain is going to be deferential to us."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "So if we say, don't do that, well, now the machines learn something a bit more about our true objectives, because something that it thought was reasonable in pursuit of our objective, turns out not to be, so now it's learned something."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So it's going to defer because it wants to be doing what we really want."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "And that point, I think, is absolutely central to solving the control problem."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "And it's a different kind of AI when you take away this idea that the objective is known, then in fact, a lot of the theoretical frameworks that we're so familiar with, you know, Markov decision processes, goal based planning, you know, standard games research, all of these techniques actually become inapplicable."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "And you get a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part of the problem."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "Because the human by making choices is giving you more information about the true objective and that information helps you achieve the objective better."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And so that really means that you're mostly dealing with game theoretic problems where you've got the machine and the human and they're coupled together, rather than a machine going off by itself with a fixed objective."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Which is fascinating on the machine and the

"text": "They are primarily responsible for our inability to tackle climate change."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "So I think that's one way of thinking about what's going on with corporations, but I

be serving."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And I think you see this with government, right?"}, {"time": 2868, "text": "Government is supposed to be a machine that serves people, but instead it tends to be

about."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "I just want to mention that what I see is the third major failure mode, which is overuse, not so much misuse, but overuse of AI that we become overly dependent."},
