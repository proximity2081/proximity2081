merciless way, obviously."}, {"time": 311, "text": "Beforehand, you know, there was the idea like, okay, with all these cockamamie ideas, we have to work together."}, {"time": 317, "text": "You know, we don't know what's going to look like for the cause."}, {"time": 319, "text": "Then as soon as he sees power, he's like, yeah, yeah, we're not doing that kind of pluralism anymore."}, {"time": 323, "text": "This is going to be the right approach."}, {"time": 325, "text": "So she left the Soviet Union, as did Berkman."}, {"time": 329, "text": "She wrote a book that they titled, My Disillusion with Russia."}, {"time": 332, "text": "And I remember this one anecdote, which I'm going to discuss in the forthcoming book, where she goes to Britain and the British were very red at the time, they really had something called the Fabian Society, which was the predecessor to the British Labour Party, which were like, all right, we're going to get rid of liberalism and have a socialist kind of nation."}, {"time": 350, "text": "And she gave talks, and there was this one time where she gave a talk and she started, and there was a standing ovation, by the time she was done, you could hear a pin drop, because she dared to look at these people in the face, something they'd been fighting for all their lives and saying, you know, we've been to the future and it works."}, {"time": 367, "text": "And she's like, guys, this is worse than the czar."}, {"time": 370, "text": "You know, people are under house arrest, you're not allowed to have, you know, newspapers are being shut down if they have heretical views, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 376, "text": "And you know, she was just even more of a pariah than she had been previously."}, {"time": 380, "text": "So she is, you know, deserves huge accolades in that regard."}, {"time": 384, "text": "I brought her up and we were talking about with our conversation with Yaron Orwell, I think you don't need me to explain what he has done and continues to do to use fiction to demonstrate the horrors of a totalitarian state."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And Camus, who might be my all time great lighthouse, so to speak, in terms of being a man of conscience, you know, he joined the Communist Party and for a lot of people in the States, you hear, oh, you joined the Communist Party, so I need to hear, it's all you need to, he was a communist, all you need to know."}, {"time": 413, "text": "He joined the Communist Party because they were the main ones fighting the fascists in France and other locations."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And he took Nazism, as did many others, of course, very, very, very seriously."}, {"time": 423, "text": "He wasn't some committed communist, but this was just his mechanism to take on, you know, be part of the underground in Vichy France, and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 431, "text": "So he had the quote, which is ascribed to him, which is kind of a misquote, Howard Zinn is the one who actually said it, that it is a job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And he very much felt, if you read his speech when he won the Nobel Prize, I forget, in the 50s, where he goes, it's basically the job of writers to keep civilization from destroying himself."}, {"time": 480, "text": "He's the guy who's like, you are ruining humans, these humans matter, and I'm not going to let you look the other way and act like you don't know what you're doing."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism, or we look at the fictional Animal Farm, what's the heroic action then?"}, {"time": 497, "text": "So Camus joined the Communist Party, there's a bunch of different heroic actions, some more heroic than others, not just for the, you know, hero is the wrong word, in terms of like effectiveness, what's the effective action, I guess is what I want to ask."}, {"time": 513, "text": "As a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind, what's the heroic action?"}, {"time": 518, "text": "That's a tricky question, because a lot of times in the West, heroism is regardless intertwined with martyrdom, right?"}, {"time": 524, "text": "So it's kind of this idea of like, you have to speak to, you know, Camus always talked about justice, let justice be done though the heavens fall."}, {"time": 530, "text": "This is a common kind of motto among people with conscience, and that you have to do the right thing, even the consequences might not be what you like."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And I think that is a good loose definition of heroism."}, {"time": 541, "text": "So if you meet, I'll give you one example of heroism."}, {"time": 543, "text": "This was on Twitter, and I really feel bad that I don't remember the guy's name."}, {"time": 549, "text": "This was the line to Auschwitz, I believe it was, and you know, there's the Nazi guards keeping everyone along."}, {"time": 556, "text": "And if you were certain, I think if you were under 12, they killed you or something, there was some age limit where some kids were killed or some were not, there was some circumstances."}, {"time": 564, "text": "And he asked the mom how old this kid was, and she's like, he's 14, and she's like, no, he's 12."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And she's like, no, he's 14."}, {"time": 570, "text": "She goes, he's 12."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And she realized what this Nazi was telling her even in that circumstance, and it ended up saving the kid's life."}, {"time": 577, "text": "So I think heroism in this context is defiance and standing true to values of liberalism, humanism and venerating the sanctity of human life."}, {"time": 591, "text": "I think that, and I think it's also important to pick your battles."}, {"time": 596, "text": "I don't think if, you know, he got, that Nazi over there got in a bullhorn and said, hey, this is the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's not going to help anyone do anything."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So I do think, you know, people a lot of times attack me for my anarchist views, like, oh, you know, would you call the police?"}, {"time": 612, "text": "Would you use the roads?"}, {"time": 613, "text": "Would you pay your income taxes?"}, {"time": 615, "text": "You know, I got in an argument with Tim Pool, because there was that couple, I think it was at Missouri or Illinois when they had their guns and they were being arrested and they basically took a plea deal and he said, you should have fought."}, {"time": 627, "text": "I go, it's a lot easier to say you should fight, but we don't know what circumstance someone is under."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And what these totalitarian regimes did very, very well, as you know, is if you were a target and they can't get through to you, that's fine, you have a family."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So you can sit there, Lex, and gird your jaw and you can stand up to all the torture, cool, what are we going to do about your wife?"}, {"time": 650, "text": "What about your mom?"}, {"time": 651, "text": "One thing Stalin did, he made it a law that kids up to 14 and up could get the death penalty for certain crimes."}, {"time": 659, "text": "So after that, the rule was from the NKVD, if you were interrogating someone, they would have death warrants for the kid's child on the desk visible."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So I'm interrogating you asking you to commit to, I'm sorry, to admit to some crime that you're not committed."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And those piece of paper, it's Svitlana, she's got a death warrant."}, {"time": 679, "text": "You're going to admit to any crime you want."}, {"time": 682, "text": "So this is something Americans, this is even the case right now in North Korea, which I know you had Yonmi Park on, it's something I talk about a lot."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Let's talk about it instead of the hypothetical, but this is happening right now on earth."}, {"time": 693, "text": "You can look at the map on Google."}, {"time": 695, "text": "The great leader, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea said, class enemies must be exterminated three generations."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So North, when people talk about individualism versus collectivism, Rick Santorum from Ascender says the family is the basic unit of society, unit."}, {"time": 710, "text": "North Korea takes that seriously."}, {"time": 712, "text": "The family is punished as a unit."}, {"time": 714, "text": "So if someone does something wrong, three generations have to pay the price and you often don't know who it is that got you all in trouble."}, {"time": 721, "text": "There's not a trial."}, {"time": 723, "text": "This to Western minds is something almost incomprehensible."}, {"time": 727, "text": "It's a lot easier to be brave when it's just your skin."}, {"time": 730, "text": "It's something when it's your child, your loved ones, every man becomes a coward."}, {"time": 737, "text": "But also what bravery is there for me to write an essay for The Guardian to say, I don't vote."}, {"time": 742, "text": "There's no consequences to me."}, {"time": 743, "text": "There's no possibility of consequences to me."}, {"time": 745, "text": "This is the wonderful thing about living in a free country."}, {"time": 749, "text": "It would take a lot of courage to be in the Soviet Union and say, I'm not going to vote."}, {"time": 755, "text": "And what would that courage accomplish?"}, {"time": 758, "text": "Heroism in the sense of kind of the suicidal stuff and taking a stance with no consequences is a bit overrated."}, {"time": 765, "text": "There is some aspect, like the way I think about heroism is something like you said about the Nazi soldier, which is quietly privately in your own life, live the virtues that you want the rest of the world to live by."}, {"time": 782, "text": "So like without writing about it is not as heroic as living it quietly."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I'll give you a great example of this."}, {"time": 790, "text": "I sometimes give talks on networking and I tell the kids, if you know someone's in town and it's their birthday with nothing to do, take them out."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And I say, I do this for selfish reasons and everyone laughs and I go, think about it this way."}, {"time": 805, "text": "The guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome."}, {"time": 810, "text": "Like you have that capacity to be that person and you're making that day feel special."}, {"time": 814, "text": "They're going to remember for a long time."}, {"time": 816, "text": "What's the cost?"}, {"time": 817, "text": "30 bucks, 25 bucks."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So it's very disturbing to me how often people have opportunities to slightly move the needle and make things a bit better at almost no cost."}, {"time": 831, "text": "And they just literally don't think in those terms."}, {"time": 834, "text": "And one of the things Camus talked about, he's often described as an existentialist, which he did not like that term."}, {"time": 841, "text": "He regarded himself as an absurdist, is the idea that we're basically blank canvases."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And this isn't something that is dangerous."}, {"time": 847, "text": "This is an enormous opportunity."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And you have the ability to become the kind of man or woman that you admire and want to be."}, {"time": 855, "text": "You don't have to be, I don't know, George Washington or one of these great heroes of all time."}, {"time": 859, "text": "But everyone out there has the capacity to be, excuse me, to be a hero to their kids or to be a hero to maybe some, there's nursing homes and there's old people who are lonely."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I think that you take in a dog that's on its last legs."}, {"time": 875, "text": "These are little things, Terry Shepherd does that a lot, I regarded him as a hero."}, {"time": 881, "text": "These are not Terry Shepherd, I'm blanking his name."}, {"time": 883, "text": "These are things that people do that aren't heroic in the sense of Superman, but that I find admirable extremely and I think are very underrated because these people aren't championed."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Is this some kind of weird, passive, aggressive and direct way for you to tell me that I should take you off for your birthday on Monday?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "Is that why you gave that whole speech?"}, {"time": 905, "text": "That wasn't it at all."}, {"time": 906, "text": "That was a joke, Michael."}, {"time": 907, "text": "No, it was a failed joke."}, {"time": 909, "text": "Nevertheless."}, {"time": 910, "text": "There was no punchline."}, {"time": 912, "text": "Without failure, we would not have triumph."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Can we stick on the Camus absurdism versus existentialism?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "In your ideas about anarchism too, it seems like those are somehow intricately connected because existentialism is connected to freedom and freedom is connected to anarchism."}, {"time": 941, "text": "But I mean, Sartre was a defender of the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 946, "text": "He said explicitly about things like gulags, like even if it's true, we shouldn't talk about it."}, {"time": 953, "text": "What people don't appreciate is how human beings can have contradictory ideas in their minds at the same time."}, {"time": 959, "text": "One would think, okay, someone's a Democrat, they think ABC, therefore they think DEF."}, {"time": 964, "text": "People would have all sorts of contradictions and it's not at all clear and they'll have a clean conscience because the human mind is very sophisticated and is capable of doing this."}, {"time": 973, "text": "So Sartre, you would think he's this radical individualist, this sense of ultimate freedom, but he's defending the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Camus, on the other hand, would probably be, was very much like a social Democrat."}, {"time": 985, "text": "He didn't really talk about what politics should be so much as it shouldn't be."}, {"time": 989, "text": "His essay, Reflections on the Guillotine, is one of the great masterpieces of all time, an attack on the death penalty, not in terms of no one's evil or it's wrong to kill murderers, but in terms of what does it do for a society?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "If you have someone who takes a person and locks them in a room and says, in two years, I'm going to murder you and you lock them for that."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "This is not someone we regard as moral, we regard this as someone who's a complete monster, but that's what the state does with the death penalty."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "And he challenges us to think, is this the kind of people we want to be?"}, {"time": 1027, "text": "And again, he's saying, I'm not saying killing a murderer is wrong."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "I'm not saying evil is wrong."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "His entire career was dedicated to fighting the concept of evil."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "But are we the kind of people who want to be doing these things that in any other context we regard as torture or depraved?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So I'm much more of a Camus person than a Sartre person."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So he was probably against war in that same way."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So I don't, I have to admit, I don't know much about the political side of Camus."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Well, and I don't think his political side is that interesting or relevant."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "What I find, sorry to interrupt you, what I find fascinating about Camus and what I think about on a daily basis from him is his insistence that you have to live a life based on conscience, that you have to be accountable to yourself when you put your head on the pelt at the end of the day and ask yourself, did I live a righteous life with integrity true to my values?"}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Did I not needlessly cause harm to innocent people?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "That kind of mindset, did I, if someone is weak, am I using that as an opportunity to exploit them or to harm them?"}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Or do I feel a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person because maybe they didn't have circumstances that were as beneficial as other people had."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Well, how does that fit absurdism where everything is absurd, nothing has meaning, it really borders on nihilism."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "So he regards, his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism and a attack on nihilism."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "He regards cynicism as the worst value people can have."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And I agree with him 100%."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "A lot of times people call me cynical online and I push back very, very hard because to be a, you know, I had this quote in the new write where I said, I'd rather be naive than a cynic because a cynic is a hopeless man who projects his hopelessness to the world at large."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Camus, this is the metaphor I use and I find it very inspirational."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I thought it was in his work, but I guess I thought if it described it to him."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "There's two types of people, you imagine you go to a mountainside and you see a blank canvas on an easel standing in front of this mountainside."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "One people be like, why is this blank canvas here, you know, what was this, what's going on here?"}, {"time": 1166, "text": "And just be confused."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Whereas the other type of person will be like, there's a blank canvas here in this beautiful countryside, what a great opportunity."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I can paint this river, I could paint that bird, I could paint my friends or myself in the background, infinite choices."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "And this is a gift that I have been given."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And I think that also ties very heavily into what I was, I went to yeshiva as a kid, which is Jewish school."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "What we were taught incessantly how to look at life is this beautiful gift that God has given you and that God wants you to be happy."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "I remember the first time I went into a church and they were asking questions about the Jewish concept, the afterlife."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "They weren't familiar with Jewish thought."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And it took me a second because I didn't really have answers."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "And then I remembered what we were taught, which is, let's suppose you're at this banquet, the best chef on earth, and the table is so heavy because you've got steaks and you've got chicken and you've got sushi and the wine's flowing and you've got your Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pibb and the store brand, everything you want."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And you're looking around at this amazing bounty, right?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "And then you turn to this best chef on earth and you're like, oh, so what's for dessert?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "I mean, the offensiveness of that is just so insane."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "You have this, eat the meal."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "I promise you, if I could deliver this meal, the dessert's going to be okay."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "So this focus on the afterlife when we've been given this amazing gift on this earth is a very kind of different mindset from both the Jewish tradition as I'd been taught and the Camus mindset."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Obviously, Camus was an atheist, didn't believe in an afterlife."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "This concept that life is meaningless, but that means you have that opportunity to find value, to seek for truth, to seek for happiness."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "And Camus has this quote, it's ascribed to him, it's like a meme."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "I've never found the source, so maybe he doesn't really say it, but he says, maybe it's not about happy endings, maybe it's about the journey."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And I think when you have that mindset, and as you and I, I think you and I both found this because neither of us, when we were kids, thought we'd be doing this, right?"}, {"time": 1294, "text": "But now that we are really fortunate."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Definitely this."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And definitely that."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But now that we're fortunate enough to do this, and that we're blessed enough that there's people who find this of value and interest, and we could pay the rent doing this, there's not a day that goes by where I don't think you and I think, this is pretty absurd, but it's also pretty wonderful."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And as a consequence of us thriving, it also shows other people that happiness is possible on this earth."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And I think cynicism is the lie."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "It's not just the worldview, it's a lie that happiness is not possible on this earth."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Or it's only possible if you sell your soul and you're a bad person, you screw other people over."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "I reject that in every aspect."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "As you said, my birthday is coming up."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "I've been feeling just a lot of really great things have been happening very, very recently."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So it affects me very heavily emotionally, especially when I see the response it gives to the kids."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "So it's one thing to say, this is what I'm for."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "But when you can provide proof of concept that what you've been advocating does result in positive responses."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "I got a message from this kid who had tried to kill himself a year ago."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And then he was like, look, I found your work, I found some other stuff."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And now I realized I'm going to make something of myself."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I was born in a meth house, you know, whatever, 19, 20 years old, I should be in the garbage."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "But I'm going to try to be a stand up because I have opportunity on this earth."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Even if he fails as a stand up, you know, he's still such whatever he does, washing dishes, there's no shame in that."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Is it so bad to have a crappy job and a girlfriend who you don't really like?"}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But as compared to the alternative of like, I'm going to kill myself."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "This is heaven."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "Well, I think there's beauty to be discovered in all of it and all of those experiences."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "So, but at the same time, so I often think about I just recently reread The Idiot by Dostoevsky."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "I often feel like the idiot."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "That's why when I say I'm an idiot, I often think about Prince Mishkin, that kind of idiot, which the world sees you as naive."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "I don't think he's naive."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "I don't think I'm naive, but I tend to see the good in people and the good in every moment."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And the world often is cynical."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And in fact, especially in what we do, often the intellectual is supposed to be cynical."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "This is very much an urban, elite, educated mindset, where if you write a book about someone who's, let's suppose, a drug addict or a prostitute, that has heft and that's valid."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "But if you're writing a book about like a love story, you know, two people fall in love and they're in roller coasters or carousels, that's less legitimate."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "I hate that so much because the message it gives to people is you have to choose between thriving and happiness and silliness and seriousness and depravity."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And I'm not saying a drug addict or prostitute is depraved, but they're basically their worldviews."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "Unless it's dark and twisted, it doesn't really count as art."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And I despise that mindset, that subtext."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So the internet and people around me often will call me naive."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "I think the word they want is innocent."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Don't you think?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "It's a better word."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "But it's not that innocent."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "No, but innocent in that you genuinely in your heart, I know you fairly well at this point, believe that goodness is possible and that people can, if not be good, at least be better than they were yesterday."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "See, even the word naive or the word innocent presumes that there's not wisdom in that."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "Presumes that somehow that's, oh, isn't that beautiful to live that life of a child who sees the world with these bright eyes and is hopeful about the future, but just wait until they grow up and realize that reality is much harsher than they think."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "But that child might be wiser than all of the adults in the room."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And don't you want to be, if the world is like that, don't you want to be the guy who takes it on and changes it for the better?"}, {"time": 1539, "text": "So it's like saying, well, you know, cancer is everywhere."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It's inevitable."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Well, don't you want to be the one who says, not anymore."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I'm here and I'm going to make that change and I can see it being better than it is now."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So I think you
