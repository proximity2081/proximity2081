"text": "They want to get off of the island."}, {"time": 249, "text": "Why would there be conflict?"}, {"time": 250, "text": "I mean, there would be conflict, but, and there can be conflict, but they'd find ways to deal with it."}, {"time": 255, "text": "I don't have this negative view of human beings, particularly not as individuals."}, {"time": 260, "text": "It's when they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really motivate them to do horrible things."}, {"time": 268, "text": "One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister an impact the book Lord of the Flies has had on our culture."}, {"time": 274, "text": "I read it in high school."}, {"time": 276, "text": "It's a superb book."}, {"time": 277, "text": "That's not even a question, but it's not accurate."}, {"time": 279, "text": "We see in many situations where people are trapped together under difficult circumstances."}, {"time": 285, "text": "Obviously that book's about children that very quickly it is not about conflict."}, {"time": 290, "text": "It very quickly becomes about cooperation."}, {"time": 292, "text": "Let's work together."}, {"time": 293, "text": "We all have the same goal."}, {"time": 295, "text": "This is not a time to worry about other things."}, {"time": 297, "text": "It really, the human beings, the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal and I'm going to shut up and go over there and have a, like stomp my feet instead of arguing with your own because we're really trapped in the situation and we need to make it work."}, {"time": 311, "text": "Well, and to the extent that they're bad people, bad people are dealt with, right?"}, {"time": 314, "text": "So this is true of all of, you know, how did we survive as a species, right?"}, {"time": 319, "text": "How have we survived as a species?"}, {"time": 320, "text": "We've been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever."}, {"time": 324, "text": "Tribes survived."}, {"time": 325, "text": "They survived by cooperation."}, {"time": 326, "text": "They survived by dealing with bad people."}, {"time": 331, "text": "Civilization is created by people cooperating and working together and allowing individuals to thrive within the group and when bad people arise, they deal with them, right?"}, {"time": 343, "text": "Now sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas and probably from day one that was going on, right?"}, {"time": 352, "text": "The whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with, but you know, underneath it all, the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think, we need to be rational and if we don't have any respect for reason, then we would all die."}, {"time": 370, "text": "We would die off."}, {"time": 371, "text": "So that's a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong?"}, {"time": 375, "text": "So with three people we might get along, we would focus on the basics of life, we have similar goals."}, {"time": 380, "text": "Once women are introduced, their incessant irrationalism and less of their hormones for SOL."}, {"time": 387, "text": "Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn't be fun."}, {"time": 392, "text": "I'm going to edit out half the things Michael said through this broadcast."}, {"time": 394, "text": "As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute."}, {"time": 397, "text": "She was a woman last time I looked."}, {"time": 398, "text": "Oh, wait a minute."}, {"time": 399, "text": "You know, you know exactly what I'm going to say."}, {"time": 402, "text": "When Ludwig von Mises or Hazlitt, I don't know who it was, Mises was praising Ayn Rand and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her."}, {"time": 410, "text": "He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you're the smartest man I've ever met."}, {"time": 414, "text": "And Ayn Rand said, did he say man?"}, {"time": 417, "text": "No, she viewed as a compliment."}, {"time": 419, "text": "But she wanted to be clear that he said man."}, {"time": 420, "text": "She was excited."}, {"time": 423, "text": "I took it as her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal."}, {"time": 427, "text": "Oh, I think that's right."}, {"time": 430, "text": "Plus, I think the perception out there, the perception in the culture of man as being rational was a compliment to her because that was affirming that he viewed her as a rational."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Yeah, because Mises is old school."}, {"time": 444, "text": "He's an older Eastern European guy, so he would definitely have these rigid views."}, {"time": 448, "text": "Like his wife, I read her autobiography, Margit von Mises, and basically he made her his secretary to the point where if he's typing something or he had something handwritten, she had to type it out."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And if she made a typo, he would tear up the page, she had to start from the beginning."}, {"time": 461, "text": "But it's like, this is the role of the man, this is the role of the woman."}, {"time": 464, "text": "So for him to regard her, this was kind of a breaking through moment."}, {"time": 467, "text": "Not that she was secretly misogynist."}, {"time": 471, "text": "So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come up with wrong ideas."}, {"time": 477, "text": "And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it's hard to figure out what's right."}, {"time": 483, "text": "So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the existence of the things around us."}, {"time": 491, "text": "And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able to communicate with the mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and some people wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control."}, {"time": 507, "text": "So you always have, Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor."}, {"time": 511, "text": "You always have a witch doctor, the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher king, and you have an Attila, you have somebody who wants control of the people, who's willing to use force to control other people."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And when those two get together, that's when things go bad."}, {"time": 529, "text": "And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together."}, {"time": 537, "text": "And so the not having them together, having the right ideas, and the right ideas are ones that are not exclusive to those guys and where we don't allow Attila to have that kind of physical power over us, that's an exception and that's rare and that's what needs to be defended."}, {"time": 555, "text": "Stalin's not personally killing people."}, {"time": 556, "text": "Hitler's not personally killing people."}, {"time": 557, "text": "Charles Manson's not personally killing people."}, {"time": 558, "text": "They need their goons."}, {"time": 560, "text": "They need their goons, but also they don't have original ideas."}, {"time": 565, "text": "Everything Stalin says is original to him, right?"}, {"time": 568, "text": "He needs a Marx, even Lenin, right?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "They all need a Marx, right?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "And Marx needs a particular line of thinkers that come before him that set him up for these kind of ideas."}, {"time": 581, "text": "So Stalin both needs his goons, even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin."}, {"time": 585, "text": "Yeah, he's a bank robber, yeah."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And then, so take Lenin, Lenin I think is a better example because Lenin's more intellectual if you will."}, {"time": 592, "text": "Lenin needs his goons, he needs his Stalins, but Lenin also needs his Marx."}, {"time": 596, "text": "And we don't want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly that his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin."}, {"time": 605, "text": "His ideas are not neutral."}, {"time": 606, "text": "I don't think it's implicit at all."}, {"time": 608, "text": "I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror, this is not implicit in the slightest."}, {"time": 616, "text": "I mean, there are letters between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples will have to be eliminated because they don't have that proletarian thing, right?"}, {"time": 623, "text": "So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe are not appropriate for the utopia to come and will have to be gone."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And Marx also had this concept which we still see today in garbled ways of polylogism, which is if you're a capitalist and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker, your logic is different than mine."}, {"time": 645, "text": "It's really going to be impossible for us to communicate."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And at a certain point, you're going to have to be liquidated."}, {"time": 649, "text": "And they pretend that doesn't mean murdered, but it means murdered."}, {"time": 652, "text": "And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And then you have the Holodomor and things like this."}, {"time": 657, "text": "No, he knows exactly where it's going to lead."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And this is why people say, oh, Marx is not evil."}, {"time": 662, "text": "He just wrote books."}, {"time": 663, "text": "No, it's the people who write books who are responsible for the way history evolves."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And they know the bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas, and they need to bear the moral responsibility for what happens when the ideas are implemented."}, {"time": 680, "text": "Here's a way."}, {"time": 681, "text": "Can I ask a question?"}, {"time": 683, "text": "Because I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does."}, {"time": 684, "text": "So let's see."}, {"time": 687, "text": "The gauntlet has been thrown down."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "Immanuel Kant."}, {"time": 693, "text": "No, that I know."}, {"time": 694, "text": "I mean, it's a big deal that Immanuel Kant is."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And most people don't understand why, because if you read Kant, there's certain passages in Kant that sound pretty liberal, they sound pretty, it sounds like he's for the individual, he sounds like he's for the American Revolution, things like that."}, {"time": 710, "text": "But when you actually read his philosophy and what he's trying to defend and what he's trying to undermine, he's trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible, that make freedom and individualism possible."}, {"time": 721, "text": "He's trying to destroy the Enlightenment."}, {"time": 723, "text": "And the Enlightenment are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible."}, {"time": 728, "text": "He's trying to undermine reason."}, {"time": 730, "text": "And without reason, we're nothing."}, {"time": 734, "text": "We can't survive as a species."}, {"time": 736, "text": "And that's why she thought he was the most evil person, because his ideas undermine the very foundations of what it requires to be a human being, reason and individualism."}, {"time": 747, "text": "Those are the things he's trying to eviscerate."}, {"time": 749, "text": "I know you've talked about Hoffman before."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to, Donald Hoffman, Donald Hoffman is the University of California, Irvine, a neurologist, a neuroscientist, something like that."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So I met him once and we were at one of these conferences where you do a quick intro, you sit and you do a quick intro."}, {"time": 774, "text": "His introduction was, I've just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned us not to see reality."}, {"time": 783, "text": "That is very Kantian."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience to defend Kant's position about epistemology and about metaphysics."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And there's nothing original there."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation and it proves I'm right."}, {"time": 804, "text": "So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman's work."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I'm not frustrated."}, {"time": 810, "text": "I just think it's completely wrong and it's anti life, anti mind, anti evolution."}, {"time": 815, "text": "I think he's an anti evolutionist at the end."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And I think it, you know, anytime you say, look, here's the important point."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Anytime you say reality doesn't exist, well, who are you?"}, {"time": 827, "text": "What do you mean by reality?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "What do any of your words mean?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "What does anything you say even mean if it doesn't refer to something that's actually out there in reality?"}, {"time": 833, "text": "I try to defend this point of view because in a certain kind of sense, I hear it as being humble in the face of the uncertainty that's around us."}, {"time": 843, "text": "Sort of, you know, when you speak with the confidence of Ayn Rand and yourself, that reason can be like this weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world and makes us like have an ethical moral life and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 859, "text": "You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Wait, hold on, hold on a second."}, {"time": 867, "text": "But I got this one."}, {"time": 871, "text": "See this is already leading to a murder by words and we've been only talking for 20 minutes."}, {"time": 877, "text": "The three of us wouldn't get together, we wouldn't get along together on an island."}, {"time": 880, "text": "We'll just make him our slave."}, {"time": 882, "text": "We're all going to get along."}, {"time": 883, "text": "He's just going to do the work."}, {"time": 884, "text": "But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave, so this is not going to end well for me."}, {"time": 890, "text": "We could provide value as dinner."}, {"time": 892, "text": "That's the problem I'm trying to get to."}, {"time": 894, "text": "That's a solution."}, {"time": 896, "text": "But Donald Hoffman says that there is like he makes an argument that exactly as you said, that what we perceive is not, is very, very far from actual physical reality."}, {"time": 912, "text": "In fact, we're not able to perceive the physical reality at all."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And he also makes the bigger claim that evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality."}, {"time": 926, "text": "So like evolution created creatures that are basically functioning way outside of what the physical reality is."}, {"time": 932, "text": "I got this."}, {"time": 935, "text": "Because there's a lot to unpack here and I hate all of it."}, {"time": 938, "text": "First of all, no, no, I'm serious."}, {"time": 940, "text": "First of all, when you were making that comment about how, you know, reason is a superpower beyond limit, you're being ironic, but it's true."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And I'll give you one example, which is astronomy."}, {"time": 951, "text": "If you look at the physical size of the universe, it's literally in one sense incomprehensible."}, {"time": 955, "text": "So he's right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us understand what it means for 93 million miles away for the sun to be."}, {"time": 962, "text": "It makes no, it's a number on another screen, right?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "That said, the fact that my mind, and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time is getting there, is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means."}, {"time": 979, "text": "The fact that we can, you know, you're a math person that you could look at galaxies and reduce it to 10 to the 64th power in terms of distance that shows the unlimited capacity of the human mind and reason."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch with reality, and I don't know in what context he's saying that because that sentence could mean a lot of different things."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Evolution is what guides, reality is what guides evolution."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Evolution works because you are fitted to the reality of the situation around you."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "It's not that someone is sitting down and says, well, I'm going to add a fin to this animal and that fin helps it swim."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "I engineered a check mark."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "It's that mutations occur."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "The vast majority of these mutations are against reality."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "They do not further this animal's life or this plant's life or this fungus's life, but the ones that are in touch with reality, such as, okay, it's really cold here."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "There's no predators here."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "If I could figure out, and I'm using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive in the cold, I don't have predation."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It's really great."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "The fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force the mutation and evolution of the form precisely means that they're in touch with reality."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Now, if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that's another thing that I really hate."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "You're referring to the reality as like the biological reality of evolution, but all of that is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath it all, and he's saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and more attachment to the actual."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Can I add one more sentence?"}, {"time": 1085, "text": "I do not, I despise the idea, I say despise, I'm not using this, I'm not joking, the idea that the reality we don't live in is somehow more real than this."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in this way, and I'm sure he's correct and none of us disagree with that."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "What we perceive, macro, works in a different way, well, that's the real reality and this is fake."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "Bullshit."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "This is the real reality."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "That is a different type, a subset, but no one's living there, and humanity is the starting point."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "It's a subset that has to integrate with this world."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "There isn't two worlds, one in the quantum world and one here."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "They're integrated."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "Now, we might not have the scientific knowledge to know how they're integrated, but so what?"}, {"time": 1129, "text": "We know that there's only one reality and that's this one."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "He has this difference."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "He says, evolution matches up to fitness, not to reality, and he creates this dichotomy between fitness and reality, but that's complete nonsense."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "There is no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "To reality."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Fitness and reality are the same thing."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "They're not separate things."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "The whole way he sets this up intellectually is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest, and certainly philosophically corrupt."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "It's Kantian."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Again, he's accepted Kant's ideas, and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant's ideas for the last 200 years, and they give it a different facade."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "He's giving it an evolutionary facade, but it's just a facade for the same idea, and that is that somehow because we have eyes, we cannot see, because the light waves are going through a medium, and that medium necessarily distorted."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "The medium changes the resolution at which you see."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "If I take off my glasses, I'm seeing it a little differently."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "The thing is still there, and the thing is still there in the way I see it, because I'm grasping the handle and lifting the cup."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "That's not an illusion."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "That is a real cup."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "So do you think some things are more real than others?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "For example, money."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "There's a bunch of things that seem real."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "This is not an Animal Farm reference."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Is this going to be about love?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "There's nothing as real as love, right Lex?"}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "There are some things that have become reality because we humans, in a collective sense, believe it."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "You can't believe something collectively."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Now it doesn't become real."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "What does it mean to say something's real?"}, {"time": 1233, "text": "That is, you can, so love, for example, love's a good example, right?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Love is an abstraction, right?"}, {"time": 1238, "text": "It's not something I can touch."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "It's not something I can see, but it's certainly something you would feel."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Not something you can hit."},
