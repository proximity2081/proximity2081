before it was cool."}, {"time": 372, "text": "Before anyone could spell it or heard of it."}, {"time": 375, "text": "And at the time people either didn't know what phosphine was or only knew it for being just possibly the most horrendous molecule that ever graced the earth."}, {"time": 386, "text": "And so no one was a fan."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And I had been considering looking for it because I did think it was an unusual and disgusting but very promising sign of life."}, {"time": 397, "text": "I've been looking for it everywhere."}, {"time": 400, "text": "I really didn't think to look in the solar system."}, {"time": 402, "text": "I thought it was all pretty rough around here for life."}, {"time": 409, "text": "And so I wasn't even considering the solar system at all, never mind next door Venus."}, {"time": 413, "text": "It was only the lead author of the study, Jane Greaves, who thought to look in the clouds of Venus and then reached out to me to say, I don't know phosphine but I know it's weird."}, {"time": 425, "text": "How weird is it?"}, {"time": 426, "text": "And the answer is very weird."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And so the telescopes we're looking at, this is visual data."}, {"time": 432, "text": "That's what I mean by visual."}, {"time": 434, "text": "You wouldn't see the phosphine."}, {"time": 435, "text": "Well, but I mean it's a telescope."}, {"time": 438, "text": "It's remote."}, {"time": 440, "text": "You're observing, you're what zooming in on this particular planet and what does the sensor actually look like?"}, {"time": 448, "text": "How many pixels are there?"}, {"time": 450, "text": "What does the data kind of look like?"}, {"time": 452, "text": "It'd be nice to kind of build up intuition of how little data we have based on which, I mean, if you look at like, I've just been reading a lot about gravitational waves and it's kind of incredible how from just very little, like probably the world's most precise instrument, we can derive some very foundational ideas about our early universe."}, {"time": 477, "text": "And in that same way, it's kind of incredible how much data, how much information you can get from just a few pixels."}, {"time": 483, "text": "So what are we talking about here in terms of based on which this paper saw possible signs of phosphine in the atmosphere?"}, {"time": 493, "text": "So phosphine, like every other molecule has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint, meaning it rotates and it vibrates in special ways."}, {"time": 501, "text": "I calculated how many of those ways it can rotate and vibrate, 16.8 billion ways."}, {"time": 508, "text": "What this means is that if you look at the spectrum of light and that light has gone through phosphine gas on the other end, there should be 16.8 billion tiny marks left, indentations left in that spectrum."}, {"time": 523, "text": "We found one of those on Venus, one of those 16.8 billion."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So now the game is, can we find any of the other ones?"}, {"time": 533, "text": "But they're really hard to spot."}, {"time": 535, "text": "They're all in terrible places in the electromagnetic spectrum."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And the instruments we use to find this one can't really find any other one."}, {"time": 544, "text": "There's another one of the 16.8 billion we could find, but it would take many, many days of continuous observations and that's not really in the cards right now."}, {"time": 554, "text": "There's all kinds of noise, first of all."}, {"time": 556, "text": "There's all kinds of other signal."}, {"time": 560, "text": "So how do you separate all of that out to pull out just this particular signature that's associated with phosphine?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "So the data kind of looks somewhat like a wave and a lot of that is noise and it's a baseline."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And so if you can figure out the exact shape of the wave, you can cancel that shape out and you should be left with a straight line and if there's something there, an absorption, so a signal."}, {"time": 587, "text": "So that's what we did."}, {"time": 589, "text": "We tried to find out what was this baseline shape, cleaned it out and got the signal."}, {"time": 594, "text": "That's part of the problem."}, {"time": 595, "text": "If you do this wrong, you can create a signal."}, {"time": 599, "text": "But that signal is at 8.904 wave numbers and we actually have more digits than that, but I don't remember by heart."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And ALMA in particular is a very, very good telescope, array of telescopes and it can focus on exactly that frequency."}, {"time": 616, "text": "And in that frequency, there are only two known molecules that absorb it all."}, {"time": 622, "text": "So that's how we do it."}, {"time": 623, "text": "We look at that exact spot where we know phosphine absorbs the other molecules SO2."}, {"time": 630, "text": "If there is extraterrestrial life, whether it's on Venus or on exoplanets where you looked before, how does that make you feel?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "How should it make us feel?"}, {"time": 642, "text": "Should we be scared?"}, {"time": 643, "text": "Should we be excited?"}, {"time": 646, "text": "Let's say it's not intelligent life."}, {"time": 648, "text": "Let's say it's microbial life."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Is it a threat to us?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "Are we a threat to it?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "Or is it only, not only, but mostly a possibility to understand something fundamental, something beautiful about life in the universe?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "You would have to bring on a poet or a philosopher on the show."}, {"time": 671, "text": "I feel those things."}, {"time": 672, "text": "I just don't know if those are the right things to feel."}, {"time": 674, "text": "I certainly don't feel scared."}, {"time": 676, "text": "I think it's rather silly to feel scared."}, {"time": 679,

with Venus is because of phosphine, now there is a chance that Venus is inhabited."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And in that case, we shouldn't go there."}, {"time": 699, "text": "We should be very careful with messing with them, bringing our own stuff there that contaminates it."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And Venus has suffered enough."}, {"time": 709, "text": "If there's life there, it's probably the remains of a living planet, the very last survivors of what once was potentially a thriving world."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And so I don't want our first interaction with alien life to be a massacre."}, {"time": 726, "text": "So I definitely wouldn't want to go near out of a, let's say, galactic responsibility, galactic ethics."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And I often think of alien astronomers watching us and how disappointed they would be if we messed this up."}, {"time": 740, "text": "So I really want to be very careful with anything that could be life."}, {"time": 745, "text": "But certainly I wouldn't be scared."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Humans are plenty capable of killing one another."}, {"time": 750, "text": "We don't need extraterrestrial help to destroy ourselves."}, {"time": 754, "text": "Scared mostly of other humans."}, {"time": 757, "text": "But these, this life, if there is life there, it does seem just like you said, it would be pretty rugged."}, {"time": 763, "text": "It's like the cockroaches or Chuck Norris, I don't know."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It's the, some kind of, it's something that survived through some very difficult conditions."}, {"time": 773, "text": "That doesn't mean it would handle us, you know, it could be like war of the worlds."}, {"time": 778, "text": "You come, just because you're resilient in your own planet doesn't mean you can survive another."}, {"time": 783, "text": "The extremophiles, which are very impressive, we should all be very proud of our extremophiles."}, {"time": 788, "text": "They wouldn't really make it in the Venusian clouds."}, {"time": 792, "text": "So I wouldn't expect, because you're tough, even Chuck Norris tough, that you would survive on an alien planet."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And then from the scientific perspective, you don't want to pollute the data gathering process by showing up there."}, {"time": 807, "text": "The observer can affect the observed."}, {"time": 811, "text": "How heartbreaking would it be if we found life on another planet and then we're like, oh, we brought it with us."}, {"time": 817, "text": "It was my sandwich."}, {"time": 818, "text": "But that's always the problem, right?"}, {"time": 820, "text": "And it's certainly a problem with Mars because we've visited the, if there is life on Mars or like remains of life on Mars, it's always going to be a question of like, well, maybe we planted it there."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Let's not do the same with Venus."}, {"time": 835, "text": "It's harder because when we try to go to Venus, things melt very quickly."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So it's a little harder to pollute Venus."}, {"time": 844, "text": "It's very good at destroying foreigners."}, {"time": 847, "text": "Well, in terms of Elon Musk and terraforming planets, Mars is stop number one, then Venus maybe after that."}, {"time": 855, "text": "So can we talk about phosphine a little bit?"}, {"time": 859,

Love talking about phosphine."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Love phosphine."}, {"time": 862, "text": "What's your Twitter handle?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's like Dr. Phosphine."}, {"time": 864, "text": "It's Dr. Phosphine."}, {"time": 866, "text": "You will be surprised here."}, {"time": 867, "text": "It wasn't taken already."}, {"time": 868, "text": "I just grabbed it."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I didn't have to buy it off anyone."}, {"time": 875, "text": "What's phosphine?"}, {"time": 876, "text": "You already mentioned it's pretty toxic and troublesome and outside, troublesome, sorry."}, {"time": 883, "text": "No, I love it."}, {"time": 885, "text": "I'm going to stop calling it troublesome."}, {"time": 888, "text": "So maybe what are some things that make it interesting chemically and why is it a good sign of life when it's present in the atmosphere?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "Like you've described in your paper, aptly titled the phosphine as a biosignature gas in exoplanet atmospheres."}, {"time": 908, "text": "I suppose you wrote that paper before Venus."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And no one cared."}, {"time": 914, "text": "In that paper, I said something like, if we find phosphine on any terrestrial planet can only mean life."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And everyone's like, yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And then Venus shows up and I was like, are you sure?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "I'm like, I was sure before I was sure."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Now that it's right here, I'm less sure now that my claims are being tested."}, {"time": 935, "text": "So phosphine, phosphine is a fascinating molecule."}, {"time": 938, "text": "So it's shaped like a pyramid with a phosphorus up top and then three hydrogens."}, {"time": 943, "text": "It's actually quite a simple molecule in many ways and you know, it's the most popular elements in the universe, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur."}, {"time": 954, "text": "When you add hydrogen to them, it makes quite simple, quite famous molecules."}, {"time": 960, "text": "You do it to oxygen, you get water, you do it to carbon, you get methane, you do it to nitrogen, you get ammonia."}, {"time": 966, "text": "These are all molecules people have heard of, but you do it to phosphorus, you get phosphine."}, {"time": 971, "text": "People haven't heard of phosphine because it's not really popular on earth."}, {"time": 976, "text": "You really shouldn't find it anywhere on earth because it is extremely toxic to life."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It interacts with oxygen metabolism and everything you know and love uses oxygen metabolism and it interacts fatally."}, {"time": 991, "text": "So it kills in several very imaginative and very macabre ways."}, {"time": 997, "text": "So it was used as a chemical warfare agent in the first world war and most recently by ISIS."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "So really bad."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Most life avoids it."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Even life that might not avoid it, so life that doesn't use oxygen metabolism, anaerobic life still has to put crazy amounts of effort into making it."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "It's a really difficult molecule to make, thermodynamically speaking."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "It's really difficult to make that phosphorus want to be together with that hydrogen."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So it's horrible."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Everyone avoids it."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "When they're not avoiding it, it's extremely difficult to make."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "You would have to put energy in, sacrifice energy to make it."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And if you did go through all that trouble and made it, it gets reacted with the radicals in the atmosphere and gets destroyed."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet we do."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "This is kind of weird molecule that seems to be made by life and we don't even know why."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Life clearly finds a use for it."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "It's not the only molecule that life is willing to sacrifice energy to make, but we don't know how or why life is even making it."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So absolutely mysterious, absolutely deadly, smells horrifically."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "When it's made, it produces other kind of diphosphenes and it's been reported as smelling like garlicky, fishy death."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Once someone referred to it as smelling like the, let me see if I remember, the rancid diapers of the spawn of Satan."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Oh, very nice."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Yeah, very vivid."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And so... You're a poet after all."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "I didn't call it that, someone else did."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And so it's just this horrific molecule, but it is produced by life."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "We don't know why."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And when it is produced by life, it's done with enormous sacrifice and the universe does not sacrifice, life sacrifices."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "And so it's this strange, contradictory molecule that we should all be avoiding and yet seems to be an almost an ambiguous sign of life on rocky planets."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Can we dig into that a little bit?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "So on rocky planets, is there biological mechanisms that can produce it?"}, {"time": 1123, "text": "You said that why is unclear, why life might produce it, but is there an understanding of what kind of mechanisms might be able to produce it, this very difficult to produce molecule?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "The enzymatic pathways of phosphine production by life are not yet known."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "This is not actually as surprising as it might sound."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "I think something like 80% of all the natural products that we know of, so we know biology makes them."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "We don't know how."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It is much easier to know life produces something because you can put bacteria in a Petri dish and then watch and then that gas is produced, you go, oh, life made it."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "That actually happened with phosphine."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "But that's much easier to do of course, than figuring out what is the exact metabolic pathway within that life form that created this molecule."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So we don't know yet."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Phosphine is really understudied."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "No one had really heard of it until nowish."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "What you were presenting is the fact that life produces phosphine, not the process by which it produces phosphine."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Is there an urgency now?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Like if you were to try to understand the mechanisms, the, what did you call them, enzymatic pathways that produce phosphine, how difficult is that of a problem to crack?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "If I'm not mistaken, even the scent of truffles, obviously a billion dollar industry, huge deal."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Until quite recently, it wasn't known exactly how those scents, those molecules that create this incredible smell were produced."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "This is a billion dollar industry."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "As you can imagine, there is no such pressure."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "There's no phosphine lobby or anything that would push for this research, but I hope someone picks it up and does it."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "And it isn't crazy because we know that phosphine is really hard to make."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "We know it's really hard for it to happen accidentally."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Even lightning and volcanoes that can produce small amounts of phosphine, it's extremely difficult for even these extreme processes to make it."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So it's not really surprising that only life can do it because life is willing to make things at a cost."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So maybe on the topic of phosphine, what, again, you've gotten yourself into trouble."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I'm going to ask you all these high level poetic questions."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "No, I would love it."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "When did you first fall in love with phosphine?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "It wasn't love at first sight."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "It was somewhere between a long relationship and Stockholm syndrome."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "When I first started my PhD, I knew I wanted to learn about molecular spectra and how to simulate it."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "I thought it was really outrageous that we as a species couldn't detect molecules remotely."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "We didn't have this perfect catalog ready of the molecular fingerprint of every molecule we may want to find in the universe."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And something as basic as phosphine, the fact that we didn't really know how it interacted with light and so we couldn't detect it properly in the galaxy, I was so indignant."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And so initially I just started working on phosphine because people hadn't before."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And I thought we should know what phosphine looks like and that was it."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And then I read every paper that's ever been published about phosphine."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "It was quite easy because there aren't that many."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And that's when I started learning about where we had already found it in the universe and what it meant."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "I started finding out quite how little we know about it and why."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And it was only when I joined MIT and I started talking to biochemists that it became clear that phosphine wasn't just weird and special and understudied and disgusting."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "It was all these things for oxygen loving life."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And it was the anaerobic world that would welcome phosphine and that's when the idea of looking for it on other planets became crystallized."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Because oxygen is very powerful and very important on Earth but that's not necessarily going to be the case on other exoplanets."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Most planets are oxygen poor, overwhelmingly most planets are oxygen poor."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And so finding the sign of life that would be welcomed by everything that would live without oxygen on Earth seemed so cool."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "But ultimately the project at first was born out of the idea that you want to find that molecular fingerprint of a molecule."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And this is just one example."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And that's connected to then looking for that fingerprint elsewhere in a remote way."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "And obviously that then at that time where exoplanets already, when you were doing your PhD, and by the way you should say your PhD thesis was on phosphine."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "It was all on phosphine, 100% on phosphine with a little bit of ammonia."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "I have a chapter that I did where I talked about phosphine and ammonia."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "But no, phosphine was very much my thesis."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But at that time when you're writing it there's already a sense that exoplanets are out there and we might be able to be looking for biosignatures on those exoplanets?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I did my PhD in 2015."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "We found the first exoplanets in the kind of mid to late 90s."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "So exoplanets were known."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "It was known that some had atmospheres and from there it's not a big jump to think, well, if some have atmospheres, some of those might be habitable and some of those may be inhabited."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So how do you detect, you started to talk about it, but can we linger on it?"}, {"time": 1475, "text": "How do you detect phosphine on a faraway thing, rocky thing, rocky planet?"}, {"time": 1483, "text": "What is spectroscopy?"}, {"time": 1485,

{"time": 1493, "text": "What are the uncertainties?"}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So the path can go this way."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "You've got light, kind of pure light."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "You can crack that light open with a prism or a spectroscope or water and make a rainbow."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "That rainbow is all the colors and all the invisible colors, the ultraviolet, the infrared."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "And if that light was truly pure, you could consider that rainbow to just cover continuously all of these colors."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "But if that light goes through a gas, we may not see that gas."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "We certainly cannot see the molecules within that gas, but those molecules will steal, absorb some of that light, some, but not all."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "Each molecule absorbs only very specific colors of that rainbow."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And so if you know, for example, that shade of green can only be absorbed by methane, then you can watch."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "As a planet passes in front of a star, the planet's too far away, you can't see it."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "And it has an atmosphere."},

that atmosphere is methane, then on the other side, that shade of blue, I can't remember if I said blue or green, that color will be missing because methane took it."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And so with phosphine, it's the same thing."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "It has specific colors, 16.8 billion colors that it absorbs it and nothing else does."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And so if you can find them and notice them missing from the light of a star that went through a planet's atmosphere, then you'll know that atmosphere contains the molecule."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So you can have this fingerprint within the space of colors and there's a lot of molecules."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And I mean, I wonder, that's a question of like how much overlap there is."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "How close can you get to the actual fingerprint?"}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Like can phosphine unlock the iPhone with its lights on?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "You said 16.8 billion, so presumably this rainbow is discretized into little segments somehow."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "How many total are there?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "How a lot is 16.8 billion?"}, {"time": 1626, "text": "It's a
