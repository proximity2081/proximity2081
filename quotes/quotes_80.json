[{"title": "Jaron Lanier: Virtual Reality, Social Media & the Future of Humans and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #218", "id": "Fx0G6DHMfXM", "quotes": [{"time": 372, "text": "Turing machines are kind of, I call them teases in a way, because if you have an infinitely smart programmer with an infinite amount of time, an infinite amount of memory, and an infinite clock speed, then they're universal, but that cannot exist."}, {"time": 391, "text": "So they're not universal in practice."}, {"time": 393, "text": "And they actually are, in practice, a very particular sort of machine within the constraints, within the conservation principles of any reality that's worth being in, probably."}, {"time": 406, "text": "And so I think universality of a particular model is probably a deceptive way to think, even though at some sort of limit, of course something like that's gotta be true at some sort of high enough limit, but it's just not accessible to us, so what's the point?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "Well, to me, the question of whether we're living inside a computer or a simulation is interesting in the following way."}, {"time": 438, "text": "There's a technical question that's here."}, {"time": 440, "text": "How difficult is it to build a machine, not that simulates the universe, but that makes it sufficiently realistic that we wouldn't know the difference, or better yet, sufficiently realistic that we would kinda know the difference, but we would prefer to stay in the virtual world anyway?"}, {"time": 461, "text": "I wanna give you a few different answers."}, {"time": 462, "text": "I wanna give you the one that I think has the most practical importance to human beings right now, which is that there's a kind of an assertion sort of built into the way the questions usually asked that I think is false, which is a suggestion that people have a fixed level of ability to perceive reality in a given way."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And actually, people are always learning, evolving, forming themselves."}, {"time": 489, "text": "We're fluid, too."}, {"time": 490, "text": "We're also programmable, self programmable, changing, adapting."}, {"time": 495, "text": "And so my favorite way to get at this is to talk about the history of other media."}, {"time": 501, "text": "So for instance, there was a peer review paper that showed that an early wire recorder playing back an opera singer behind a curtain was indistinguishable from a real opera singer."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And so now, of course, to us, it would not only be distinguishable, but it would be very blatant because the recording would be horrible."}, {"time": 517, "text": "But to the people at the time, without the experience of it, it seemed plausible."}, {"time": 523, "text": "There was an early demonstration of extremely crude video teleconferencing between New York and DC in the 30s, I think so, that people viewed as being absolutely realistic and indistinguishable, which to us would be horrible."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And there are many other examples."}, {"time": 541, "text": "Another one, one of my favorite ones, is in the Civil War era, there were itinerant photographers who collected photographs of people who just looked kind of like a few archetypes."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So you could buy a photo of somebody who looked kind of like your loved one to remind you of that person because actually photographing them was inconceivable and hiring a painter was too expensive and you didn't have any way for the painter to represent them remotely anyway."}, {"time": 565, "text": "How would they even know what they looked like?"}, {"time": 567, "text": "So these are all great examples of how in the early days of different media, we perceived the media as being really great, but then we evolved through the experience of the media."}, {"time": 577, "text": "This gets back to what I was saying."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Maybe the greatest gift of photography is that we can see the flaws in a photograph and appreciate reality more."}, {"time": 584, "text": "Maybe the greatest gift of audio recording is that we can distinguish that opera singer now from that recording of the opera singer on the horrible wire recorder."}, {"time": 593, "text": "So we shouldn't limit ourselves by some assumption of stasis that's incorrect."}, {"time": 601, "text": "So that's the first thing, that's my first answer, which is I think the most important one."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Now, of course, somebody might come back and say, oh, but you know, technology can go so far."}, {"time": 609, "text": "There must be some point at which it would surpass."}, {"time": 611, "text": "That's a different question."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I think that's also an interesting question, but I think the answer I just gave you is actually the more important answer to the more important question."}, {"time": 618, "text": "That's profound, yeah."}, {"time": 620, "text": "But can you, the second question, which you're now making me realize is way different."}, {"time": 626, "text": "Is it possible to create worlds in which people would want to stay instead of the real world?"}, {"time": 633, "text": "Like, en masse, like large numbers of people."}, {"time": 638, "text": "What I hope is, you know, as I said before, I hope that the experience of virtual worlds helps people appreciate this physical world we have and feel tender towards it and keep it from getting too fucked up."}, {"time": 657, "text": "Do you see all technology in that way?"}, {"time": 658, "text": "So basically technology helps us appreciate the more sort of technology free aspect of life."}, {"time": 668, "text": "Well, media technology."}, {"time": 670, "text": "You know, I mean, you can stretch that."}, {"time": 673, "text": "I mean, you can, let me say, I could definitely play McLuhan and turn this into a general theory."}, {"time": 679, "text": "It's totally doable."}, {"time": 680, "text": "The program you just described is totally doable."}, {"time": 683, "text": "In fact, I will psychically predict that if you did the research, you could find 20 PhD theses that do that already."}, {"time": 689, "text": "I don't know, but they might exist."}, {"time": 691, "text": "But I don't know how much value there is in pushing a particular idea that far."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Claiming that reality isn't a computer in some sense seems incoherent to me because we can program it."}, {"time": 704, "text": "We have technology."}, {"time": 706, "text": "It seems to obey physical laws."}, {"time": 708, "text": "What more do you want from it to be a computer?"}, {"time": 710, "text": "I mean, it's a computer of some kind."}, {"time": 712, "text": "We don't know exactly what kind."}, {"time": 713, "text": "We might not know how to think about it."}, {"time": 714, "text": "We're working on it, but."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Sorry to interrupt, but you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 719, "text": "Like, that's my fascination with the AI as well, is it helps, in the case of AI, I see it as a set of techniques that help us understand ourselves, understand us humans."}, {"time": 730, "text": "In the same way, virtual reality, and you're putting it brilliantly, which it's a way to help us understand reality, appreciate and open our eyes more richly to reality."}, {"time": 743, "text": "That's certainly how I see it."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And I wish people who become incredibly fascinated, who go down the rabbit hole of the different fascinations with whether we're in a simulation or not, or, you know, there's a whole world of variations on that."}, {"time": 760, "text": "I wish they'd step back and think about their own motivations and exactly what they mean, you know?"}, {"time": 765, "text": "And I think the danger with these things is, so if you say, is the universe some kind of computer broadly, it has to be because it's not coherent to say that it isn't."}, {"time": 779, "text": "On the other hand, to say that that means you know anything about what kind of computer, that's something very different."}, {"time": 786, "text": "And the same thing is true for the brain."}, {"time": 787, "text": "The same thing is true for anything where you might use computational metaphors."}, {"time": 792, "text": "Like, we have to have a bit of modesty about where we stand."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And the problem I have with these framings of computation is these ultimate cosmic questions is that it has a way of getting people to pretend they know more than they do."}, {"time": 805, "text": "Can you maybe, this is a therapy session, psychoanalyze me for a second."}, {"time": 810, "text": "I really liked the Elder Scrolls series."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It's a role playing game, Skyrim, for example."}, {"time": 816, "text": "Why do I enjoy so deeply just walking around that world?"}, {"time": 821, "text": "And then there's people and you could talk to and you can just like, it's an escape."}, {"time": 828, "text": "But you know, my life is awesome."}, {"time": 829, "text": "I'm truly happy, but I also am happy with the music that's playing in the mountains and carrying around a sword and just that."}, {"time": 842, "text": "It's very pleasant though to go there."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And I miss it sometimes."}, {"time": 846, "text": "I think it's wonderful to love artistic creations."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's wonderful to love contact with other people."}, {"time": 855, "text": "It's wonderful to love play and ongoing evolving meaning and patterns with other people."}, {"time": 864, "text": "I think it's a good thing."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I'm not like anti tech and I'm certainly not anti digital tech."}, {"time": 874, "text": "I'm anti, as everybody knows by now, I think the manipulative economy of social media is making everybody nuts and all that."}, {"time": 882, "text": "So I'm anti that stuff."}, {"time": 883, "text": "But the core of it, of course, I worked for many, many years on trying to make that stuff happen because I think it can be beautiful."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Like I don't like, why not?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "And by the way, there's a thing about humans, which is we're problematic."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Any kind of social interaction with other people is gonna have its problems."}, {"time": 910, "text": "People are political and tricky."}, {"time": 914, "text": "And like, I love classical music, but when you actually go to a classical music thing and it turns out, oh, actually, this is like a backroom power deal kind of place and a big status ritual as well."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And that's kind of not as fun."}, {"time": 927, "text": "That's part of the package."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And the thing is, it's always going to be, there's always gonna be a mix of things."}, {"time": 934, "text": "I don't think the search for purity is gonna get you anywhere."}, {"time": 940, "text": "So I'm not worried about that."}, {"time": 942, "text": "I worry about the really bad cases where we're making ourselves crazy or cruel enough that we might not survive."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And I think the social media criticism rises to that level, but I'm glad you enjoy it."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And I like that you basically say that every experience has both beauty and darkness, as in with classical music."}, {"time": 963, "text": "I also play classical piano, so I appreciate it very much."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I mean, every, and even the darkness, it's a man's search for meaning with Viktor Frankl in the concentration camps."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Even there, there's opportunity to discover beauty."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And so that's the interesting thing about humans, is the capacity to discover beautiful in the darkest of moments, but there's always the dark parts too."}, {"time": 991, "text": "Well, I mean, it's our situation is structurally difficult."}, {"time": 997, "text": "We are, no, it is, it's true."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "We perceive socially, we depend on each other for our sense of place and perception of the world."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "I mean, we're dependent on each other."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And yet there's also a degree in which we're inevitably, we never really let each other down."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "We are set up to be competitive as well as supportive."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "I mean, it's just our fundamental situation is complicated and challenging, and I wouldn't have it any other way."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Okay, let's talk about one of the most challenging things."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "One of the things I unfortunately am very afraid of being human, allegedly."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "You wrote an essay on death and consciousness in which you write a note."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Certainly the fear of death has been one of the greatest driving forces in the history of thought and in the formation of the character of civilization."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And yet it is under acknowledged."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "The great book on the subject, The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker deserves a reconsideration."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I'm Russian, so I have to ask you about this."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "What's the role of death in life?"}, {"time": 1071, "text": "See, you would have enjoyed coming to our house because my wife is Russian and we also have, we have a piano of such spectacular qualities, you wouldn't, you would have freaked out."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But anyway, we'll let all that go."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So the context in which, I remember that essay sort of, this was from maybe the 90s or something."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And I used to publish in a journal called the Journal of Consciousness Studies because I was interested in these endless debates about consciousness and science, which certainly continue today."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "And I was interested in how the fear of death and the denial of death played into different philosophical approaches to consciousness."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Because I think on the one hand, the sort of sentimental school of dualism, meaning the feeling that there's something apart from the physical brain, some kind of soul or something else, is obviously motivated in a sense by a hope that whatever that is will survive death and continue."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And that's a very core aspect of a lot of the world religions, not all of them, not really, but most of them."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "The thing I noticed is that the opposite of those, which might be the sort of hardcore, no, the brain's a computer and that's it."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "In a sense, we're motivated in the same way with a remarkably similar chain of arguments, which is no, the brain's a computer and I'm gonna figure it out in my lifetime and upload myself and I'll live forever."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Yeah, that's like the implied thought, right?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Yeah, and so it's kind of this, in a funny way, it's the same thing."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "It's peculiar to notice that these people who would appear to be opposites in character and cultural references and in their ideas actually are remarkably similar."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And to an incredible degree, this sort of hardcore computationalist idea about the brain has turned into medieval Christianity with together, like there's the people who are afraid that if you have the wrong thought, you'll piss off the super AIs of the future who will come back and zap you and all that stuff."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "It's really turned into medieval Christianity all over again."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "This is so the Ernest Becker's idea that death, the fear of death is the warm at the core, which is like, that's the core motivator of everything we see humans have created."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "The question is if that fear of mortality is somehow core, is like a prerequisite to consciousness."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "You just moved across this vast cultural chasm that separates me from most of my colleagues in a way."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And I can't answer what you just said on the level without this huge deconstruction."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Should I do it?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Yes, what's the chasm?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Let us travel across this vast chasm."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Okay, I don't believe in AI."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "I don't think there's any AI."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "There's just algorithms, we make them, we control them."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Now, they're tools, they're not creatures."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Now, this is something that robs a lot of people, the wrong way, and don't I know it."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "When I was young, my main mentor was Marvin Minsky, who's the principal author of the computer as creature rhetoric that we still use."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "He was the first person to have the idea at all, but he certainly populated AI culture with most of its tropes, I would say, because a lot of the people will say, oh, did you hear this new idea about AI?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And I'm like, yeah, I heard it in 1978."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Sure, yeah, I remember that."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "So Marvin was really the person."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And Marvin and I used to argue all the time about this stuff because I always rejected it."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And of all of his, of all of his, I wasn't formally his student, but I worked for him as a researcher, but of all of his students and student like people of his young adoptees, I think I was the one who argued with him about this stuff in particular, and he loved it."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Yeah, I would have loved to hear that conversation."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "It was fun."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Did you ever converse to a place?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So the very last time I saw him, he was quite frail."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And I was in Boston, and I was going to the old house in Brookline, his amazing house."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "And one of our mutual friends said, hey, listen, Marvin's so frail."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "Don't do the argument with him."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Don't argue about AI, you know?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And so I said, but Marvin loves that."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And so I showed up, and he's like, he was frail."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "He looked up and he said, are you ready to argue?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "He's such an amazing person for that."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So it's hard to summarize this because it's decades of stuff."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "The first thing to say is that nobody can claim absolute knowledge about whether somebody or something else is conscious or not."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "This is all a matter of faith."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And in fact, I think the whole idea of faith needs to be updated."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So it's not about God, but it's just about stuff in the universe."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "We have faith in each other, being conscious."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And then I used to frame this as a thing called the circle of empathy in my old papers."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then it turned into a thing for the animal rights movement too."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "I noticed Peter Singer using it."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "I don't know if it was coincident or, but anyway, there's this idea that you draw a circle around yourself and the stuff inside is more like you, might be conscious, might be deserving of your empathy, of your consideration, and the stuff outside the circle isn't."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And outside the circle might be a rock or, I don't know."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And that circle is fundamentally based on faith."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "Well, if you don't know it."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Your faith in what is and what isn't."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "The thing about this circle is it can't be pure faith."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "It's also a pragmatic decision and this is where things get complicated."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "If you try to make it too big, you suffer from incompetence."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "If you say, I don't wanna kill a bacteria, I will not brush my teeth."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I don't know, like, what do you do?"}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Like, there's a competence question where you do have to draw the line."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "People who make it too small become cruel."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "People are so clannish and political and so worried about themselves ending up on the bottom of society that they are always ready to gang up on some designated group."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And so there's always these people who are being, we're always trying to shove somebody out of the circle."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "So aren't you shoving AI outside the circle?"}, {"time": 1501, "text": "Well, give me a second."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "So there's a pragmatic consideration here."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And so, and the biggest questions are probably fetuses and animals lately, but AI is getting there."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Now with AI, I think, and I've had this discussion so many times."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "People say, but aren't you afraid if you exclude AI, you'd be cruel to some consciousness?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And then I would say, well, if you include AI, you make yourself, you exclude yourself from being able to be a good engineer or designer."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And so you're facing incompetence immediately."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "So like, I really think we need to subordinate algorithms and be much more skeptical of them."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Your intuition, you speak about this brilliantly with social media, how things can go wrong."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Isn't it possible to design systems that show compassion, not to manipulate you, but give you control and make your life better if you so choose to, like grow together with systems."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And the way we grow with dogs and cats, with pets, with significant others in that way, they grow to become better people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "I don't understand why that's fundamentally not possible."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "You're saying oftentimes you get into trouble by thinking you know what's good for people."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Well, look, there's this question of what framework we're speaking in."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Do you know who Alan Watts was?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So Alan Watts once said, morality is like gravity that in some absolute cosmic sense, there can't be morality because at some point it all becomes relative and who are we anyway?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Like morality is relative to us tiny creatures."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "But here on earth, we're with each other, this is our frame and morality is a very real thing."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "Same thing with gravity."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "At some point, you get into interstellar space and you might not feel much of it, but here we are on earth."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And I think in the same sense, I think this identification with a frame that's quite remote cannot be separated from a feeling of wanting to feel sort of separate from and superior to other people or something like that."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "There's an impulse behind it that I really have to reject."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "And we're just not competent yet to talk about these kinds of absolutes."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Okay, so I agree with you that a lot of technologists sort of lack this basic respect, understanding and love for humanity."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "There's a separation there."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "The thing I'd like to push back against, it's not that you disagree, but I believe you can create technologies and you can create a new kind of technologist engineer that does build systems that respect humanity, not just respect, but admire humanity, that have empathy for common humans, have compassion."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "I mean, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "I think, yeah, I mean, I think musical instruments are a great example of that."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "Musical instruments are technologies that help people connect in fantastic ways."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And that's a great example."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "My invention or design during the pandemic period was this thing called together mode where people see themselves seated sort of in a classroom or a theater instead of in squares."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "And it allows them to semi consciously perform to each other as if they have proper eye contact, as if they're paying attention to each other nonverbally and weirdly that turns out to work."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And so it promotes empathy so far as I can tell."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "I hope it is of some use to somebody."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "The AI idea isn't really new."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "I would say it was born with Adam Smith's invisible hand with this idea that we build this algorithmic thing and it gets a bit beyond us and then we think it must be smarter than us."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And the thing about the invisible hand is absolutely everybody has some line they draw where they say, no, no, no, we're gonna take control of this thing."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "They might have different lines, they might care about different things, but everybody ultimately became a Keynesian because it just didn't work."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "It really wasn't that smart."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "It was sometimes smart and sometimes it failed, you know?"}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And so if you really, you know, people who really, really, really wanna believe in the invisible hand is infinitely smart, screw up their economies terribly."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "You have to recognize the economy as a subservient tool."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Everybody does when it's to their advantage."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "They might not when it's not to their advantage."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "That's kind of an interesting game that happens."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "But the thing is, it's just like that with our algorithms, you know, like, you can have a sort of a Chicago, you know, economic philosophy about your computer."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "Say, no, no, no,
