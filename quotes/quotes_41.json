looking at the middle column, try to predict as the system evolves, say anything like conclusive about the future of the system as it evolves."}, {"time": 351, "text": "It's both beautiful that simple rules can create that kind of complexity."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And it's also sad that we can't like make perfect sense of it, like perfectly predict the future."}, {"time": 365, "text": "Even though it's all simple and deterministic, we can't say something conclusive about like when the thing will end."}, {"time": 372, "text": "When will this little cellular automata like evolve in a certain way and then nuclear weapons will be invented and they blow each other up and then they'll just be this empty 1D cellular automata."}, {"time": 381, "text": "Well, doesn't that make it fun though?"}, {"time": 384, "text": "Yeah, it's fun, but when you're trying to create and we'll talk about something that operates the economy and the way humans transact and cooperate and fall in love and work together, then you'd like to be a little bit more formal and try to say something conclusive."}, {"time": 402, "text": "If this entire universe is just cellular automata, then being conclusive is kind of hopeless, generally speaking."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And the hope is, I guess, that there'll be pockets of which within the cellular automata where you could be predictive, where you can formally show that something is true and then you can rely on that."}, {"time": 423, "text": "You'll be resilient and all those kinds of things, even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess that's unpredictable."}, {"time": 429, "text": "Didn't they call that Laplace's demon?"}, {"time": 431, "text": "Yes, I wonder what the demons up to these days."}, {"time": 434, "text": "Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that."}, {"time": 437, "text": "But sticking on philosophy, you've also mentioned, among others, that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke are two of your favorite philosophers."}, {"time": 447, "text": "Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs you find insightful and also what do you use the difference, because you're both an engineer and a thinker, so what do you use the difference between philosophy and computer science?"}, {"time": 460, "text": "Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element to both Russell and Saul."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And then there's this, of course, amazing work that they did in the late 19th and 20th century."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And you can't really talk about Russell or Saul without also mentioning Wittgenstein and Tarski."}, {"time": 478, "text": "Because when you actually look at these guys and you put them together, what they were attempting to do was increase the level of precision we had in analyzing both formal languages and also language in general."}, {"time": 488, "text": "And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me."}, {"time": 491, "text": "So there's amazing people out there that somehow can parse that, but."}, {"time": 495, "text": "He doesn't make sense to himself either."}, {"time": 497, "text": "I think you're right about that."}, {"time": 498, "text": "However, Kripke has Kripkenstein."}, {"time": 500, "text": "He has his whole building on that, right?"}, {"time": 504, "text": "And he built a whole hierarchy."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And at least there I have modal logic and I have the little boxes and I have the diamonds and I can do a computation and I can kind of reason about things that people are saying."}, {"time": 515, "text": "But really it was all just about precision and the nature of truth, precision, the nature of necessity and possibility."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And the magic of these statements is that you can then start getting a better understanding of basically how far a formal language can take you."}, {"time": 532, "text": "And so that's the work of it."}, {"time": 533, "text": "David Hilbert also did the same thing."}, {"time": 535, "text": "And Russell, he got his career started working with Alfred North Whitehead."}, {"time": 539, "text": "He was a logician and there was this whole desire in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics in a completely new and better way."}, {"time": 547, "text": "And they started with geometry and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system, although recently we've discovered there's a few holes in that."}, {"time": 554, "text": "But for the most part it was complete and the axioms are independent and they're consistent."}, {"time": 560, "text": "And they said, oh, well now we can do this for all of mathematics."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books, like two big books, Principia Mathematica, a thousand pages and the conclusion is one plus one equals two."}, {"time": 572, "text": "So they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic all in these beautiful ways."}, {"time": 576, "text": "Then little by little, as we entered the 20th century, logicians started chipping away at this idea that you could actually construct a complete system of mathematics."}, {"time": 589, "text": "They said, oh, you're not complete, you're not decidable."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position where his early life's work was basically forgotten."}, {"time": 599, "text": "So he had to kind of reinvent himself."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And so he went into ethics and he went into different fields of philosophy."}, {"time": 603, "text": "He became this titan in analytic philosophy and he was also a great pacifist and he was just a phenomenal writer."}, {"time": 611, "text": "If you read Why I'm Not a Christian or any of his other attacks on metaphysics, he said, look, I can only deal with the world I'm in in the senses that I have and if I can deduce it, I believe it."}, {"time": 621, "text": "If it's outside of that, I really can't make meaningful statements about it."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And he said it in a lovely English prose that you would expect of a man of his stature."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Now, Sol Cryptry, it was like the complete opposite."}, {"time": 633, "text": "This guy's really down to earth dude, not aristocratic at all."}, {"time": 636, "text": "And he was one of those guys that just could have done anything because he was so, he's so brilliant."}, {"time": 642, "text": "I guess he's still alive."}, {"time": 643, "text": "I think he's 80 something."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Yeah, he's getting up there, man."}, {"time": 647, "text": "But I mean, literally, when he was in high school, he wrote these papers in logic and Harvard contacted him, said, hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school first before I go and teach grad school at Harvard."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And so this is just one of those guys that you can see through his work that he can think deeply about anything."}, {"time": 665, "text": "He's like the Galois of philosophy and he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes that Tarski and others couldn't resolve."}, {"time": 672, "text": "He said, let's really get serious about the nature of truth."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Let's really try to resolve paradoxes."}, {"time": 677, "text": "Let's really try to build things in such a way that the work that we leave behind can actually be built upon and it's not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And it was the same for Tarski."}, {"time": 687, "text": "He comes in and he says, we mathematicians love this concept of truth, but yet we've never really created a nice rigorous definition that doesn't have paradoxes embedded inside of it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "So he had to invent metal languages and object languages, all these notions and so forth."}, {"time": 700, "text": "So I really liked those four, if you think about them."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And there's a lot of great lessons."}, {"time": 706, "text": "And where it's relevant today is, you have human beings and you have computers and they're trying to understand each other."}, {"time": 712, "text": "And computers live in the formal world and human beings live in the natural language world."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And those bridges between those two are still not completely clear."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing in the 20th century, 19th century had nothing at all to do with that, but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist between those two worlds."}, {"time": 730, "text": "And maybe there are some nice tools for that bridge to be built upon."}, {"time": 733, "text": "And maybe that in some way will allow computers to better understand us."}, {"time": 737, "text": "I mean, they've even created languages, natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity free like Lojban and things like that."}, {"time": 745, "text": "L O J B A N, Lojban."}, {"time": 747, "text": "It's based on a language called Loglan and it's a spoken language that's equivalent to first order predicate calculus."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So no ambiguities, it's logically consistent."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Yeah, Lojban."}, {"time": 758, "text": "But can you still have fun in it?"}, {"time": 760, "text": "You can get very."}, {"time": 760, "text": "Can you write poetry or what?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "There's people who actually write poetry in Lojban."}, {"time": 764, "text": "I'm gonna switch to that and start tweeting in it."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So there's a lot there and they're just fun to study and think about."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole, you'll spend way, way too much time and there's diminishing returns."}, {"time": 777, "text": "Now, the second question you asked was one on theoretical computer science to, I guess, engineering."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Philosophy, no, no, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 784, "text": "So first step, you said humans and computers."}, {"time": 787, "text": "So theoretical computer science is theory of the computer and philosophy is the theory of the human."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer, but in terms of these two worlds of the theory of the human, which is philosophy and the theory of the computer, which is computer science, what do you think is the difference?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned, what is going to be the biggest challenge?"}, {"time": 813, "text": "Like, can we formalize love?"}, {"time": 815, "text": "Can we formalize music, art, poetry, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "Or is that human nonsense that we need to get rid of?"}, {"time": 822, "text": "No, I don't think it's human nonsense at all."}, {"time": 823, "text": "I mean, there's even attempts to create algorithmically generated music."}, {"time": 827, "text": "And the question is, is love just strictly a chemical phenomena?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "Is there something like metaphysical about it or transcendent of some sort of formal system?"}, {"time": 839, "text": "I mean, computer science is just saying, hey, we have this notion of computing."}, {"time": 843, "text": "We have this brain that we've constructed, this formal system that we've built."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And given that we have it, what can we do with it?"}, {"time": 851, "text": "And so some people worry about the roots of the tree of knowledge, the great Yggdrasil of computer science."}, {"time": 857, "text": "They worry about the roots and say, how far can we grow them?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "And let's keep adding these new models of computation."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And other people worry about the trunk of the tree."}, {"time": 865, "text": "And some people worry about the leaves of the tree."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And the more advanced the field gets, the closer and closer it gets to the people who constructed it, us."}, {"time": 875, "text": "We have better image processing."}, {"time": 877, "text": "We have better ways of handling speech to texts."}, {"time": 879, "text": "And we have better ways of computers kind of understanding the intent of what a human being is saying."}, {"time": 885, "text": "And then the question is, well, how will a computer understand love or poetry or music?"}, {"time": 890, "text": "Well, it'll understand it the same way we understand it."}, {"time": 892, "text": "You have to get a computer to grow up to a point, work and learn the way we learn or as close to it as possible."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Then you just expose it to the things that we were exposed with."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And then at some point, the computer will start creating things."}, {"time": 904, "text": "So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "And I have no clue about that."}, {"time": 909, "text": "But it's a... You make it into an NFT and see how much it excels for it."}, {"time": 915, "text": "But basically, yeah, there's so much of it is subjective."}, {"time": 918, "text": "And that's a fascinating whole area of, that I'm fascinated with this human robot interaction is how do we create compelling experiences that are subjectively compelling, whether it's art or just two humans talking or two humans interacting in some kind of way to maximize the richness of the subjective experience."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And I think that could be an optimization problem that could be solved."}, {"time": 939, "text": "We're solving it all the time."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Human civilization is constantly trying to... We're constantly trying to impress each other."}, {"time": 946, "text": "When we're younger, trying to get laid, whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work by all the awesome stuff you do."}, {"time": 954, "text": "I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem that's purely, for the most part, is subjective."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Right, did you ever watch Blade Runner 2049?"}, {"time": 962, "text": "Yeah, did you remember the whole relationship between Joy and Kay?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "And did she really love him, the hologram or not?"}, {"time": 968, "text": "Was it like fake love or real love?"}, {"time": 970, "text": "Fake it till you make it is my view on love."}, {"time": 973, "text": "No comment from Charles."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So let's go to the difference between theoretical computer science and software engineering."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Or I don't know if you draw a distinction, but if we look into this computer world now, is there a difference between theory, things you can say formally, and the pragmatic implementation of that theory into actual systems that people use, which I guess we'll call software engineering?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So the engineer, they're obsessed with the domain of, well, what do you want to accomplish and who are you accomplishing it for?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So they live in the world of people, if they're good engineers."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "And they say, okay, what's the experience?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "How are we going to use this?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Why are we going to do this?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "What's the commercial application?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "What's the noncommercial application?"}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And you collect all these business requirements."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "And once you've done all of that, the better job you do, the more self evident it is of how do we apply the toys and tools of computer science and other such things to actually resolve that."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And the point of theoretical computer science from the software engineering domain is it can tell you kind of where your guardrails are."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "It won't make perfect programs."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "And there's no such thing as that, but rather it can give you a good notion and sense that your program has some desirable properties."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Like maybe you can prove that it can terminate."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "If you're dealing with total programs or maybe you can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow or you won't divide by zero somewhere or something like that."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Some event won't occur that'll cause a catastrophic failure in your system."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "But there's always this combinatorial explosion between what you can test and think about and what you can actually code."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So the stuff on the left hand side lives in a different cardinality, a different universe."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "There's something significantly larger there."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And the tools on the right hand side, we have property based testing and these SAT solvers."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "We have all this great stuff here in formal methods land and computer science theory land, but there's only a small subset of things that they actually give you good answers about."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So the balance of the two things is basically saying, well, what do you care about?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And what are you okay throwing away?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "That's the art of engineering and building these types of things."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So, you know, cryptocurrencies, we deal with these complex distributed systems that have cryptography and game theory and Byzantine actors."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So the balance there is saying, okay, what can't fail in that system?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And that's the kind of stuff that you want to apply as heavy a tool set as you can, because when that stuff fails, you either have a loss of billions of dollars, privacy, or potentially even life, depending on how these systems get adopted."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "But then other things, you know, what can fail?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Is it okay if the block doesn't get made every now and then?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Is it okay if your latency goes up or your network suddenly becomes asynchronous and you disconnect from it and you have to restart the computer or something like that?"}, {"time": 1145, "text": "That's probably okay."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It's an inconvenience and burden to the user."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And if you actually try to chase that tail, you'll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and ghosts."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "And meanwhile, the whole world moves on."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So it's really figuring out those balance of the two."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools have gotten so much better over the last 20 years in particular, mostly because of incredibly high investments from Microsoft and Google and big universities, because these guys are building these gargantuan systems."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "If you look at the Googleplex or what Amazon has or others, and they have so much value, so many users, so many things going on, and no person can keep that in their head."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And so you're talking about systems may have 10 million lines of code, 15 million lines of code, millions of nodes connecting, faulty processes happening all the time, hackers breaking in on a regular basis."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So when you're trying to model all of that, trying to ask yourself, what formal guarantees and properties can I get to simplify this system as much as possible?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So instead of the applications of formal methods slowing you down, in many cases, it actually massively reduces your debugging time and your ability to find where errors occur."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "In some cases, you can't find where errors occur inside these massive concurrent systems."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?"}, {"time": 1219, "text": "We're talking about just the same thing."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "But we're talking about a much more hostile operating environment, where instead of it running in a pristine data center in California somewhere, it's running on your cell phone, it's running on your mom's phone, it's running your dad's phone, it's running on some computer in Mongolia that may have good internet on Tuesday, but not any other day."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So when you live in that kind of environment, you really do need to think carefully about a whole new class of protocols."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you need to think carefully about a whole new class of tools and techniques to test the reliability of those systems."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And you need to separate the world and say, what is high assurance and cannot fail?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Because if it fails, people lose money."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And what is low assurance?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And it's okay if that falls apart."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "The other thing I'll mention is there are perverse financial incentives in our industry."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Because the reality is when something blows up, the people who built those things that blow up usually get paid upfront."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "So what they're focusing on is time to market, speed to market, and getting tokens out and getting them liquid."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And then people come in, they buy it, but if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol, it'll probably be discovered six months later or something like that."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It blows up, who suffers?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "The users."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "The people that created that already got paid."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Exactly, that's why you pay the guy who makes the breaks software for your train last."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And you make sure he rides the train every day."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So you're basically describing the complexity of a distributed system that's fundamentally game theoretic."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And like, if we think about turtles all the way down, it's humans all the way down."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Is there something you can say formally about human nature to try, you said you can't, there's certain parts of the system that can't fail."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way, that there's this game theoretic construction of mutually assured destruction."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Oh, that rhymes, see, I'm a poet."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "That system can't fail because you're gonna blow everyone up but you can't formally say for sure it's not going to fail."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So like, you're basically trying to chase, like statistically reduce the probability that these particular critical aspects will fail."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world at small scale to see where things go wrong."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Yeah, it's a great question."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And the problem with game theory and mechanism design is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And I don't think in my life I've ever met a rational actor."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "There's a rational actor on Tuesday, but any other day of the week, who the hell knows?"}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And there's even, I think there was a book Freakonomics and there's a few of these things where it just shows again and again where people behave in ways that are against their best interest."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So then you have these protocol designers and they say, well, we need an honest majority for this thing to work."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive model and rational actors will behave with that incentive model."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And they say, well, the individual won't do that but the firm, the government, the entity will."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples where the system was actually behaving in weird ways."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Like we almost completely eradicated the human population twice in the 20th century, once during the Cuban missile crisis."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel and they installed a new satellite system and it said, hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "You need to turn the key in, launch all the missiles in the silo."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And he said, oh, that's not right."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "That doesn't seem right."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So in both cases, a single person stood against the systems of superpowers between us and nuclear annihilation."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So in general, we're really bad at building these types of things."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So what you look for instead is say, can the system be self correcting?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "It's not about avoiding a problem."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "It's more about can the problem be resolved?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And that's how nature engineers things."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It gives you an immune system."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "It gives you the ability to heal."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event, the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So it's a better question of how do you align the incentives over the longterm of a system where all the actors within the system, when an event occurs that disrupts it, have an incentive to push it back into a healthy, productive, useful state, which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff that we began with and a little bit about, how do you handle modern economics?"}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis that there would be catastrophic economic disruption throughout the entire world."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "In the developed world, it was print lots of money and hope to God it works."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "In the developing world is try not to starve to death."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Over 100 million people were pushed into acute starvation."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "So acute hunger, it's a terrible situation."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "But every economist knew we were going into that."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So the question is how do you restart the system?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "How do you realign the system and so forth and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point."},

experiments for the macro."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "In the years past, you never got a chance to experiment with monetary policy."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years, you'd have some conference, usually in a cool island like Jamaica and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And these would be nation states, invitation only."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies floating around all with their own monetary policy and their rules and it's

really get as much traction."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Like Al Grant is a great example of that."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "I mean, Silvio, he's an incredibly bright guy."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner and his work is legendary and it's just beautiful and elegant and he literally has all the people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "He went and hired Tal Robin and she got at IBM Research and Craig Gentry, the guy who did homomorphic encryption under Dan Boneh is there."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "There's all these amazing people on that team and they have money in the VCs."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So you'd say, okay, that's a contender."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "But if you look at market adoption, Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it and other things are above it."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced Dogecoin organism that's just stomping all around."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Evolution doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Exactly, but maybe it's worth the problem, not evolution, because the market's the market and you can scream and cry and pout and stamp your foot and say this makes

1626, "text": "So the question isn't the local, it should be the longterm and will the system over time converge to a state that actually is useful and meaningful to society and actually solve problems for it and that's what we try to figure out is how do we perturb these things in a way to kind of push them in that direction."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "So before we go into this fascinating Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies, let me ask you sort of a basic programming question."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program and to express the theory of computer science."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I still love Lisp."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Oh man, it's great, these are your father's parentheses, they're elegant weapons from a time long ago."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "But that's a great starting point and it's not about falling in love with a language, it's just falling in love with computing, it's about falling in love with having a dialogue with a computer and thinking about, well, how would I solve that?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "How would I interact with that?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "What does this need to look like?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "You might think that what you've built is the paper but the computer's not going to tell you that because the paper's written in prose and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something but there's no proof chain, evidence chain that you can show that there's no ambiguity."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "When you look at a functional language, you're a little closer to math and so as a consequence, the translation of the papers that we spent so damn long writing and writing proofs about and so forth to code is much smaller."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Now the downside is these functional languages tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have not necessarily the best Windows support and the libraries aren't so good and also they tend to be a little slower when compared as a whole on average to languages like C for example."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "So it's really a question of okay, what are you designing for for version one?"}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Are you designing for performance and are you designing for developer accessibility or are you designing for correctness and are you designing for a high fidelity representation of the protocol?"}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one because we knew that the kinds of people who think about that are also the kinds of people that would have an easy time reading a paper like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this and they would do a pretty good job running a formal specification and then translating that into running code."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Then once you have that, you have a blueprint that you can actually reason about, maintain and if you really wanted to, you could then turn that into a Rust code base or into a Java code base."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Going the other way around would be kind of pointless and counterproductive."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "The other side of it is that Haskell code or functional code tends to be significantly more concise and I actually have a real life example of that."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So if you take a look at Mantis, we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code and you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin, I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So it's almost 10 times smaller and so less code, less to read and you tend to read code significantly more than you would read write code."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So it's always an advantage for a maintenance, understandability, documentation and other sort of things when you have more concise code bases and also it's a lot easier for you to apply stronger tools to a functional code base like static analysis or property based testing or these types of things than an imperative code base."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "But the thing is, it's almost like a religion or language, it's like saying, French versus Russian versus English, everybody has their adherence."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "They say, oh, they have the best poetry here."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Russian, yeah, wins."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "There you go, always a Russian."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Everybody has their favorite tools and their favorite languages, but it just comes down to what problems are you trying to solve and what problem domain do you live in?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "If you're inventing new protocols based on science, you're gonna take the time to write a paper, go through the peer review process as you've done personally, you know how hard it can be to get into a conference and go through that and get your ass kicked."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care to the engineering side in terms of implementation of that or else you will make a mistake and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system that destroys the security properties of the system."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So we really had no choice but to go to some notion of functional."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F Sharp or Clojure where you still have some connection to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?"}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris or Agda or, you know, Isabel?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And there you can really dial up the correctness and write all kinds of crazy proofs."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "But by the way, it's like the seven people who write your code, they go on vacation a lot, you'll never get anything done."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground between those two where if we needed to pull into the left, we could, if you wanted to pull into the right, you could as well."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "That said, it's really amazing to see what the hybrid languages have done."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "If I was a new student in computer science and I said, you know, learn any language to grow your career from, Scala 3 is probably the language to go with."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Yeah, it's great, because it's like you want it to be like Java, it's Java."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And it looks kind of like a Java program."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "You want it to be like Python and scripted and you reuse a REPL, you can do that."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "You want to go hardcore dot, you know, dependent

really hardcore work in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language that does a little bit of everything."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And it's got great applications in data science and AI."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "It's also heavily used in modern companies, like Netflix uses Scala for all of their microservice architecture."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "Yeah, so that's a great language and it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire people into it."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "You just find these Eastern European guys who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years, they got tired of making $20 an hour, so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour and they're really good at it."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that's a great gateway drug because you have like QuickCheck and

forth."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "So it gets you a little bit of everything and you can then move around that entire design space in a beautiful way."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla, you go Python and JavaScript."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "When you're getting started."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "It's the getting started."}, {"time": 2109, "text":

"text": "Any other language support other than Haskell?"}, {"time": 2158, "text": "The example this person gives is TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, et cetera."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Also, have you considered a yearly conference focused around developers?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Ha ha, yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "In fact, it just so happens that coincides with the Goguen Summit."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So we're doing that, I think the third week of September."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "You can bring a lot of cool people together and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "But to the question in particular, Plutus is like any other language."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Plutus core, you can compile things into it."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "So it's entirely possible to write a Scala to Plutus core compiler or TypeScript compiler or something like that."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns and we don't live in a single chain model anymore."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So you have a situation where you probably wanna have different execution environments and different chains."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So you have different virtual machines there."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "And that's why we work so closely with the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Kagori Roshu's team at runtime verification."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "What they did is they said, let's start with something very familiar, LLVM, which has been around for a really long time and they happened to have created it there with Apple."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "And let's take that and translate that into the blockchain space."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "Okay, then once you have it, then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages like the C's and C++'s and other things that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So that's a different execution model than what we tried to build for Plutus, which focuses on correctness, okay?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So then all you have to really do is say, can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Because then you kind of, and I did a video, it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And the basic idea was say, you have an island where everything's perfect."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Calypso lives there, life is great."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "People feed you grapes every day, but maybe you can't do everything on the island."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And the ocean's big, it has everything, but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "So that's what Yella is about."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's basically this bring LLVM into our world."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And at some point in the next three to five year time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in, but they're gonna come in with all their flaws and their warts and their problems."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "And then the pond was the idea of the Ethereum virtual machine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "There's some network effect around it and there's some great tooling that's materialized and evolved."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And it's not clear if that's the standard yet, or if like MySpace or Blackberry or all of these other things, it'll fade away."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Well, if it becomes the standard, okay, don't fight nature, just support it."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And the same thing that gives you the ability to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models and they're encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems, but you can move ADA applications, information between those two systems."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And so your main chain will always stay somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount of expressiveness required on it to do all kinds of interesting things."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also for interoperability, be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things, but it's not trying to be everything to everyone."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women, but no ice cream."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms, for the record, what is Plutus?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So Plutus is a programming language."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And basically we wrote it after spending about three years thinking about all smart contracts."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "We were trying to figure out like, what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2384, "text": "And then we started thinking, well, what is a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Is it the whole application, or is it just like a sub module within an application?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And usually it's the latter more than the former."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "You can build a self contained program like a script, but usually what's happening is you'll have it like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft or something like that."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "You say, hey, maybe I wanna actually create gold in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Okay, so I'm gonna issue a token."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "Well, and then maybe I wanna create some mechanics behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "So that would be like a smart contract layer and issue an asset."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So you have this centralized server running and proprietary software controlled by a single company, but then you've opened your application up to a broader world."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And what we've done now is added a blockchain layer and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset and the spending policy of that stuff."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So that is a much smaller program than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So the point of Plutus was let's create a language where you can write these small to midsize programs and have a high degree of confidence that they behave with correctness and also they give you deterministic results on the consumption of resources."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "You can run things locally and you actually understand what it costs to run and that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "If you dial up the expressiveness of the system and like Ethereum does and these big mutable account systems, the problem is you have to have global state."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So whatever you test locally doesn't actually necessarily translate to what you've deployed, okay?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So we spent a long time asking like where's the Goldilocks zone?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Bitcoin script was too restrictive and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up, it led to mega problems."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Like there was a beautiful thing called the value overflow incident in 2010, which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "They had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug and pretend like it didn't exist."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "But that was mostly because of an issue with how the scripting language was implemented."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And when you look at Ethereum, it's like this pure game of stomping down these skirmishers where every update there's something they have to change or tune and then it's not clear how you shard such a model."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "So we said, let's build something that's in the middle of this and that's what Plutus basically is."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "And it's really designed to play very nicely with off chain infrastructure as much as on chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "So you can look at all those different examples, whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes or Blizzard wants to issue an in game currency or your Uber and you wanna start putting peer to peer dynamics inside your system, you're gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "And it's very clear how those two things connect together."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "Just so happens Haskell's really good for this."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code onto off chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "So in the future, you'll be able to have your off chain run a node or the Java virtual machine or a.NET application and there'll just be this beautiful interface and then it can talk to all your on chain code and that's written in that DSL and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus that reveals the beauty of this balance that you're referring to?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program actually today."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Yeah, I heard about this."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Yeah, but you know, there you'd want to have the whole round trip."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So you'd like to have an interaction and I think a video game would probably show it the best."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Like if we could re implement CryptoKitties or something like that on it and you have this off chain infrastructure and you have your GUI in your front end, it's running on your phone or a browser and most of that lives off chain."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And then, but your CryptoKitties, they'd live on the blockchain."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "The whole round trip end to end with relatively low fees and low latency and high availability of service, it never goes down."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "That would probably be the best thing to do and we'll have something like that by August."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "It's pretty easy to build this stuff."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So what kind of off chain interactions are supported with Plutus?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "What are the limits you want to put on the thing so it doesn't get chaotic?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "That's the beautiful thing."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "When you have a less expressive model on chain, it means you can do anything you want off chain."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "So you started talking about smart contracts, but let's zoom back out and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "You're timestamped, you're immutable and auditable, either in a global or a local sense."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented where it's really important that when you put some information down, it doesn't change and other people can see it and that you know when it was put down."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "For example, a property ledger."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land like mineral rights or water rights or these things, you'd like to transitively see how does it go from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth and what was the state of these things as they were transitioning?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So how much did they pay, when did it occur, et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "Okay, well normally these types of ledgers are so important that they're managed either by governments or regulated entities."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And the issues are that while they can be efficient, they're generally brittle to political manipulation and they're brittle to geopolitical events."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "For example, when Syria fell apart, the very first thing ISIS did, they started saying, hey, the ownership of the land, it's gonna fundamentally change."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "We've decided that this guy over here now owns all these things and then when peace comes, how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting all these details out, putting all together in a place that you know that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor, that it will still stay preserved."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Usually kings and empires, they have the ability to decide what's true."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics and once something goes in there, you know that that's there."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "Okay, so that's the first part of it."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "The second part of it is that it's auditable, meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric or the president or some very special club of people get to see what's going on, suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what where."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "Like imagine a tax system where the public club just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires and said, well, how much do they make and how much do they pay?"}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Well, imagine a tax system where that's just done by default or other social systems where this type of information is put in by default."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains, just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot, I've been to 52 countries in the last five years."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe, I get hit by a car or something and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says, hey, I need all Charles's medical records."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "He's unconscious right now, but I need it to treat him because he's quite ill."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "They'd say, who is this

to be in charge."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Some group has to be in charge."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And you can do it with a meritocratic, hashocratic computation thing."}, {"time": 3178, "text":

that spring up right there."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But first linger on this topic and say, what is proof of work?"}, {"time": 3235, "text": "What is proof of stake?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "Just zooming in on each of those."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "And what are the differences?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Okay, so they all have the same three properties of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "So it's basically like buying lottery tickets and you can buy a certain amount every second with your computing devices."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "And some of them are ASIC resistant."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So you run them on like a laptop or a GPU."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "And some of them are you specialized hardware that you have to either manufacturer or buy from someone who sells it to you."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And that's just how many tickets per second you can get."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And eventually you hit those magic numbers."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "When you do, it means you have the right to make the block and generally you bundle the block making with the proof of work system."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "Now you can do this looking for a single or you can do this to actually shard it and look for multiple block makers at the same time."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "So there are sharded proof of work protocols like Prism is an example of that."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And actually Ethereum got started this way with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom, the Aviz Ahar's work and Yonatan Sonlopinsky."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people, they make some collection of things and there's some way to sort it all out, serialize it and prevent double spends, great."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "So instead of doing things, they say, well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average over a long period of time, you'd probably win 25% of the time."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in from some source and then 25% of the time on average over a long period of time, you'll win."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So it's a synthetic resource, but you still have to do the other two things."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "You still have to make the block and you still have to validate the block."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "The big difference is this step in the proof of work world is horrendously expensive."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "And the problem with that is that you have less resources for the other two."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And the other problem with that is that if this is horrendously expensive, you have an economy of scale kick in."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So what ends up happening is the system becomes less decentralized over time because you have these vertically integrated operations."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility on a volcano in El Salvador."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "Not everybody can go to Mongolia and set up a five gigawatt power plant and a huge data thing."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Not everybody has access to the patented basics that people produce."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Because what if I don't sell it to you and I have the patent on it?"}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So you'll end up having centralization around maybe 10 or five major operations as we've seen historically with proof of work."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And that means you end up having like a ruling class of a mining oligarchy in the system."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly, you actually get more decentralized over time because as the currency goes up in value, the distribution of the currency tends to get more egalitarian."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft, he had 64% of the shares."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Now he has less than 5% of the shares."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So this founder drift over time, as the value goes up, divestment occurs, you have more and more and more people coming in."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "That means there's more people who can participate in the consensus."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "You can even tune economic parameters."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "We created this concept of K in the system and it's just a parameter."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And it's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pools."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1000 and so forth."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up, you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks that are unique and distinct."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource instead of a physical resource, which means it's portable by the click of a button."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So let's say China says, mining is bad, we're gonna shut it all down."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And it looks like they're moving in that direction."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "You have all these people in WeChat, just like trying to sell miners or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners, because they have these huge data centers they've constructed."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "You can't exactly go and grab a server and like take it with you, it's huge."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "It's a lot of work."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "And if the government sees it, well, it's their property now."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "A virtual resource, you can click a button and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "So to me, for a virtual asset, it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security to something endogenous, something within the system, because it's just like the asset, it can move anywhere at a click of a button and human beings have a much harder time attacking something like that."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?"}, {"time": 3501, "text": "Because some people would argue that proof of work has, because it's outside the system, it's tied to physical resources, it's more secure."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "It's less prone to attack by large groups of people."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And the first question we had was, could proof of stake actually work or not?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "So the problem was that the engineers kind of led when the science should have led."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And so there were all these POS protocols that came out in the early 2010s, like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And there they had suffered from things like the random number generation wasn't good."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake and all these other things."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "And there's a lot of beautiful properties for proof of work from a theoretical sense."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "We even wrote a paper called GKL, named after the authors, Juan Gray, Niko Leonardis and Agelos Gassis, our chief scientist."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "It's got 1100 citations now and it was published in 2015."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "But basically all it did is just model the blockchain and created some security properties for it."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "And then it started talking about, well, what does proof of work actually do for you?"}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And it turns out it does a lot."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "It's an asynchronous system."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "You can bootstrap from Genesis."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network and Daisy joined the network, then you give them some different chains, like five or 10 different chains."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "They can run a calculation and they will always pick the longest chain, the heaviest chain inside the system."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "That's a great property of proof of work."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Until we published Ouroboros Genesis in 2018, you actually needed to solve that in proof of stake with a trusted checkpoint."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "So some actor had to be observing, watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "And then when new people joined in, they would only be able to distinguish between a chain based upon a checkpoint telling them that."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math to show and create this notion of like density to be able to show that that's possible."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "But there's a lot of properties of proof of work that were super hard to replicate and emulate in the proof of stake world."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "There was a group out of Cornell that talked about better network conditions."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "They wrote a paper called Sleepy."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "We did Genesis."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "We also did the very first proofably secure protocol, but that was six years of work and like 12 papers."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And it's still not done."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "There's still a few polishing things that have to be cleaned up because this is a physical resource and there's something there."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "But there's a flaw to proof of work that is a little problematic."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "It's a winner take all type of a system."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So maximalism is kind of philosophically and computationally built into it."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "Let's say you have two proof of work systems and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "And they use the same algorithm."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "Then the problem is if the miner comes in and let's say the miner has enough resources to have 51% for any of these chains, they actually have a perverse incentive to come and destroy one chain and short sell the asset, it's called a gold finger attack, and then go mine the other asset because they're not bound to that asset."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "They're not loyal to it."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "And they can make just as much profit mining this as they can make mining the other system and the markets allow them to profit from the destruction of a system."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from because the only way you can participate in a proof of stake system is you have to actually own equity and you have to have ownership in that system."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain, it would just be a net loss for the most part, unless you have really messed up markets or something like that."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "So there's always trade offs and all these things."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And this is why I like this concept of going one to end and having multiple resources, because why not have proof of work and proof of stake together?"}, {"time": 3722, "text": "If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation, and why not add other things like create incentives for network relay?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Right now there's no incentives in the system for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Right now it's not a problem, but if you're running like Amazon web services level of bandwidth, it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "No one would do it."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "So then your system will centralize along the weakest link, whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer, or the network layer of the system."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "So if you can incentivize the resources differently, then you'll be in a beautiful position where you end up having a resilient system that pays its own bills."},

work?"}, {"time": 3770, "text": "Yeah, this was a philosophical difference between Vitalik and myself."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "The problem with the people in the Ethereum side is they're really bright."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And these really bright people, what they do is they try to do everything all at once because they're really, really smart and they keep going until they run up against the wall and they realize the problem is a lot harder."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "If you're more experienced, and that's why we brought in proper academics like Aggelos and others, because they've been beaten up through life, Aggelos worked with David Chom and these other, it's really hard work with those guys."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "And they'd already been humiliated and yelled at and had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And so they were humble enough to say, I'm not smart enough to solve the big problem."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "So don't even try."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay, what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems that you can compose your way up to a working

Ouroboros protocol in 2017."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "And that protocol was like a synchronous system and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked, but it was useless because that's not real life."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "Then Prowse came out and then suddenly we relaxed things."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "So these are all, by the way, names for consensus algorithms."}, {"time": 3852,

you can see all this stuff that's described there and pools have an operating fee cause they're like a business."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "And they say, well, if you delegate to me, I'll charge this much."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards, I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "And then you make your decision and whichever one you select, you click delegate, push the button and then you have now given your staking rights to them until revoked."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "Okay, so it lives there."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then the stake pools weight in the system is proportional to the amount of stake that they have delegated to them."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And then we have this other limiting factor K, which says that you get diminishing returns with the more stake you have."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's kind of like an S function."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "So you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps and then at some point you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So there's an incentive to split pools to different owners after some point."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Yeah, and so that's a complex thing and you have to actually model the game theory out to understand where those parameters should be set."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "And we didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "So what we did is we bought talent."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "We went to Oxford and we hired this guy named Elias Kasupis, he's an

little."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "So the sexy problems multiply exponentially."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point where we're starting to work on refinements to the

question is well, is Cardano the solution?"}, {"time": 4499, "text": "You know, is that that thing?"}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And the answer is no, because you need a lot more evolution."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "You need decades of evolution to kind of work your way there."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And in many ways the work is never quite done but it's better than what came before."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Because you have a realization that first the control of the system needs to be more balanced and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "So there's this sustainability component of who's in charge and how do you pay for things?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Well, the system can print its own money so it always has the ability to have a budget."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Okay, so there's a treasury idea."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And then there's a voting thing."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "Well, the same things that allow you to move money around allow you to represent votes."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "And you know, if you played Gnomic in the 1980s or Peter

great."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "Okay, so that exists there."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And then you say, okay, well, but this thing still has to touch the legacy world."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "There has to be cash in and cash out and these types of things."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So there's just this interoperability thing that you need a wifi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry because nothing understands each other right now."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "There are all these chains are blind, deaf and dumb to each other."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And then there's this thing that it has to work at a huge scale, like billions of people."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And we've done that, but we've done that with large multinational trillion dollar companies with centralized infrastructure."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "We've never really done that with one master protocol that somehow does it for everyone."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And there's, you know, there was, it's a cool protocol, but it doesn't have all the oomph necessary to, necessary to do something like this."}, {"time": 4596,

what do you want to do, then you build a community."}, {"time": 4607, "text": "Now it's over a million people strong and that community keeps growing and they keep pushing the system in that particular direction."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And what's nice about it is if you build the right philosophy within the system, it doesn't need founders."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "This is the great lesson of Satoshi."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "It doesn't need founders to be able to get there."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "So, you know, if you look at the academic side, that's very decentralized."},

400 different scientists from all across the world, some from Russia and some from India, some from China and some from Japan and America and Africa and South America."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And the faces change, the languages change, the cultures change, but the process stays the same."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And that is a permanent organ within what we have constructed as a system."},

people in Ethiopia."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "We're getting them digital identity and we're dragging that digital identity into the system."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "Cause that's the most fundamental thing of a financial operating system."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "You need to know who people are in order to be able to do business with them, give them credit, be able to give them economic agency and so the thing."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "But once they're there, they're going to grow up with that system."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "They're going to deploy applications on that system."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "They're going to build on that system or use it every day for getting a loan or payments and so forth."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And if they have pain points, what they're going to do is evolve that system to be able to mitigate, manage those particular pain points to a point where the system is competitive for it."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "So my job is to be, we have this tagline in our company, cascading disruption."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "My job is to be the first domino."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "Just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade and it kind of blows and blows and blows up until eventually it gets to where we need to go."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "And what I was trying to think about with Cardano was how do you build the minimum viable set of tools and social processes that once we push the domino, the system will just evolve to a point where eventually you can grow to fill that need, not out of charity, but out of self interest."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "People want things better, faster, cheaper."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "People want to have economic agency, especially when they lack it."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "Nobody wants to grow up in a world where they're unbanked and they have no access to marketplaces."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "They're gonna seek it."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "Look at Mpesa."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "It's the great example of that, like cell phone minutes they're using as a currency."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "And I say a few more years, I think we'll have that rate minimum viable set of dynamics inside the system."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "And then it's inevitable in my view that it'll kind of grow and consume and become this concept."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "And what's really cool is there's competition in the systems and concepts."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "So China is trying to do the same thing."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "They're saying, how do we de dollarize the world and create a digital Yuan?"}, {"time": 4768, "text": "So they have a very top down notion of how to apply this technology and bring it in."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "And they even have an identity system they're building in parallel called social credit."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "We have an identity system, a talaprism that we're putting in."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "Ours is

figure out a way to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way that we can better quantify value and transform it, move it, manipulate it."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "And in many ways we've

12 year old kid in Texas."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "It's pretty amazing to see that."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "But sort of in that whiteboard presentation, you gave these three phases and you're kind of implying that there'll be end phases to this whole evolution."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "And Cardano is just like the cutting edge."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "But if you look back to Bitcoin,

done in a lot of media interviews, because I think it really helps people understand where we're at in the clock is face things in terms of generations."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve is saying every time we wanna represent or move value, we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "So can we build some sort of system where we can create some notion of value that can be teleported around the world and it doesn't require a

it's very interesting."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "And there's a guy at Boston University, his name will come to me in a second, who came up with this stuff."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "And I think there's some merit there, especially as we start moving closer to this idea of blockchains being used to validate proofs instead of running computations."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "What's the Sigma protocol, by the way?"}, {"time": 6536, "text": "So it's just a way of expressing scripts."}, {"time": 6538, "text": "And basically, you get these concise representations of proofs, and then you can say, okay, the script is correct, but you don't have to run the whole program."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice, there's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And in a Redeemer validator model, you need stuff like that, because as your model gets more complex and a lot more things happen, you don't want to have a situation where I have to run, replay a huge amount of the UTXO graph to be able to get to a point where I have the state of the system."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "You need some mathematical artifact that gives you the state of the system quickly."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "And then you're saying, okay, I now know what computation thread I need to run to be able to get enough to be able to redeem this transaction."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So he just found a more compressed representation of it, and the math doesn't matter."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "What matters is there's a whole beautiful field that thinks about this type of stuff, and it was never once linked before into our industry."}, {"time": 6595, "text": "The brilliance of Alex was to actually realize you could do that and pull those things together, and it may actually have some merit, but by no means is he the only guy that does this stuff."}, {"time": 6603, "text": "There's actually other approaches in verified computing that have explored that."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research is a project called Pinocchio, and there was a followup called Geppetto."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "And the basic idea was that it's fortuitous that you have these computer science problems like hashing where you can do all this computation, and once you've done all of it, and you've found this magic number that you can verify that the computation was done correctly."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "So the proof of work works this way."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "Hard to do the proof of work, easy to check the proof of work."}, {"time": 6637, "text": "Cryptography also works this way."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "You have some trap door where you can verify something's correct, but to get that thing done, if you're doing it brute force, it takes an enormous amount of computation."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "Well, not all problems are like this, like protein folding, to verify the protein is folded correctly, you have to fold the protein."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So you have to redo the work."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "But what if for arbitrary computation, you could take a problem, and then you could generate a proof that you've done that computation correctly, and the proof validates in logarithmic time or constant time."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "Wow, that's incredible, right?"}, {"time": 6666, "text": "Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "It's called Pinocchio."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "So that's another example of these types of things, these rollups of things where instead of doing the computation on chain or trying to create some sort of replicated machine that does all this stuff, you instead just say, okay, only thing I'm gonna use the blockchain for is to check your proof."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "But I'm gonna turn it into a distributed computing problem, and any person in the world can do the problem on any server, untrusted server even, because you don't have to trust the output, you trust the proof, and the proof is deterministic."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "It tells you these things."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "So whether you're using zero knowledge or Sigma protocols or some other mechanism, it's moving you in that particular direction to turn it from a replicated to a distributed problem and go from I'm doing the work to I'm checking that the work was done correctly."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "And all of a sudden, we're back to the P equals NP thing where for many very interesting problems, the checking is efficient, is much more efficient than the solving."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "Right, and also do you want complete determinism or is it probabilistic?"}, {"time": 6725, "text": "Because if you relax that requirement a little bit, then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things you can construct this stuff for."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "You mentioned UTXO."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "There's a paper titled the Extended UTXO Model."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "It writes in the introduction, Bitcoin and Ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable and popular cryptocurrencies use two rather different ledger models known as the UTXO model and the account model respectively."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "At the same time, these two public blockchains differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart contracts that they support."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "This is no coincidence."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "So what's the fuck that mean?"}, {"time": 6789, "text": "What is UTXO, what is the account model, and what is the idea of the Extended UTXO model?"}, {"time": 6797, "text": "So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "So let's assume you don't have credit cards, you just have cash."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes or whatever and you go to the cashier, you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them, unless it comes up to 17.50, they have to make change."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "So you don't tear your $20 bill, cut a piece of it off and say, here's part of my 20."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "You give them the entire $20 bill and then they give you something back."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "And the things that they give you back are also atomic units, they don't cut those things up."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "So that's kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell is that there's inputs and outputs, your inputs that 20 and your outputs will be the 17.50 that goes to them and then the remaining change that goes back to you, okay?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "The problem with this particular model is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin, there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates, complex contracts on this thing, where instead of just saying, okay, I'm just gonna push value to you, I wanna put lots of terms and conditions into the movement of that value."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "Like you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday or you only get this if some event happens like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that."}, {"time": 6872, "text": "Okay, so you need some notion of programmability with it."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "So a lot of people are trying to figure out in the early days of Bitcoin, how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?"}, {"time": 6881, "text": "And one of ways of doing it is you can go to a different accounting model, bank style accounting."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal, a deposit, it's a mutable system."}, {"time": 6894, "text": "With the cash register accounting, you don't tear up the bills, but the bank you can deduct or add ledger all the time."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system where you just, you send messages, you send transactions and you're going up or down."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And so you can trigger programs the same way."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, if you take the UTXO model and you have some data to it, and instead of saying it's just a digital signature, but it's in a script, you can basically create something that's still the same as cash register, but now you have programmability and the big difference is local versus global."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "So whatever's going on in that cash register has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers."}, {"time": 6937, "text": "But when you look at bank accounting, you have to know the state of the entire banking world to be able to make that work."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "Because if that transaction is inbound, that wire transfer is inbound, you have to know those funds are actually there, that thing is actually happening."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "So when you have a global state for a program, it's like you could do a lot more with it, but it's a lot more dangerous."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And so you have to build all these mechanisms to try to protect yourself from it."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, add data, add a programmability, and you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone between what Ethereum did with an account style model and a global state system."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "And you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin, but you're still in a Turing complete world, you can still run all kinds of things."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And then any standard mathematician, they'll say, okay, well, is it isomorphic?"}, {"time": 6979, "text": "Is there a mapping between this?"}, {"time": 6981, "text": "What type of function can I actually take something expressed in one structure and transmit it to the other structure and properties are preserved?"}, {"time": 6988, "text": "So we wrote a paper, it's called Climatic Ledgers, where we actually showed that UTXO, Extended UTXO and accounts are somewhat similar in that you could map things that happen in one system to the other system, the properties are preserved between the two."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "So in practice, what's nice about Extended UTXO is that you can put infrastructure on top of it to make the development experience relatively similar to the development experience of what you would do with Ethereum, but you don't have to worry about this global state."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "So when you talk about sharding, it's a lot easier to do that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "It's a lot more conceivable to that."}, {"time": 7022, "text": "And also you get determinism in the system."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "So when I have a Plutus smart contract, whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run in the system."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "When you have a concept of this mutable global state in the system, whatever you run locally is not necessarily what you're gonna get when you actually push it into the system."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "So you may misprice things and the contract will fail."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world."}, {"time": 7043, "text": "So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive on the boundaries and a little bit harder to write certain types of software with it."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build higher level languages and other such things that compensate for these types of things and design patterns that compensate for these types of things."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "The other advantage that we have that's really fun and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model and there are other UTXO based systems."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things, there's actually already a group of people that understand this very well."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And that's still a fairly large part of the mindshare of the entire space."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "So there are no silver bullets."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "And anytime you pick a particular model, there's an upside and a downside."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "And there's different ways of doing things from cash register accounting or bank accounting."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "You can even do different accounting models."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "But we felt this was kind of the best first step to go into because we started with something very familiar that had a long history behind it."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "And it maps very beautifully to functional programming principles."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "This concept of immutability and these things and much more strict management of state and no notion of having this global concept that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer when they actually start real writing an application?"}, {"time": 7130, "text": "Not too much."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "There's gonna be a little bit of retooling and some new patterns you have to learn."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "But in practice, you can still do the same things."}, {"time": 7136, "text": "You can implement a Uniswap style thing."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "In fact, we even wrote that code with the Plutus Pioneers program."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture and see how that's done."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "You can do a stable coin."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "You can do an Oracle."}, {"time": 7147, "text": "You can do interactive contracts."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "It's just, it has to be done a little differently than the way that you would do it in an account style model."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Just like you could run an application in Java, you can run an application in Haskell."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "They both can do the same thing, but the code is gonna look different."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "And the canonical way of looking at things is different."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks, what are your thoughts about chain link and external off chain data sources?"}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And everything we've been talking about now with the external, with the extended UTXO model."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without

trying to keep a straight face."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "You need the outside world to make your system useful."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do with a smart contract usually involve human beings and information streams aggregating and doing something."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "So the Oracle is a super important component in practice for any smart contract involving any notion of value."}, {"time": 7224, "text": "You need to know when things have happened, how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "So first, where do you get the data from?"}, {"time": 7231, "text": "So what's the aggregator?"}, {"time": 7232, "text": "This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram because one of the things you'll know about Wolfram as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Every email, every communication, every interaction, he's archived somewhere."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "Like last time I talked to him, oh, yeah, I have emails from you from 2012."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "It's like, you still have those?"}, {"time": 7248, "text": "Yeah, every keystroke is written down and stored somewhere."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "So if you use Wolfram Alpha, it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And so you can query the system and be like, oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted more than a billion dollars of cargo loss and at least one fatality?"}, {"time": 7266, "text": "And it'll return an answer."}, {"time": 7268, "text": "I mean, it's an incredible source of data that's computable."}, {"time": 7271, "text": "For people who don't know, Wolfram Alpha is more than just the thing that assists you with your math homework in high school."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "It's actually this giant network of data of like weather data, of location data, just statistic, all kinds of, it's doing the aggregation in a way that you can query across data sets."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "And it's exactly this kind of idea."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "It basically represents the very kind of thing you would hope to be able to query off chain as part of the smart contracts."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "Right, but the only downside is it's centralized."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "And that's always the Achilles heel of Wolfram is he tends to like proprietary things and he tends to like centralizing things and mostly because he likes running the things."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "And everybody can have an opinion on that."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "The thing though is that after you've done aggregation, there's a question of injection."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "How do you get that data into the system?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "And you can do that in a very naive way where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach a public key to it and it'll sign for that data feed, that injection."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "And then somehow I'll just trust it as it is."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Or you could try to make it more complicated."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "You could wait data feeds from different sources and have some notion of truthiness or a veracity metric or something like that."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies that was born out of the academy."}, {"time": 7349, "text": "I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it and there's some good people on that side."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate, a philosophy about how do you inject and how do you create incentives so that that process over time gets more federated or more decentralized instead of centralizing around one particular setup."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "Now, closely related corollary to this is computation off chain."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "So as I mentioned, smart contracts are intimately connected to our Oracle."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "The question is how much pre processing and state management are you gonna do outside of the system versus what do you do inside of the system?"}, {"time": 7383, "text": "So it's a very interesting balance between these two."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "There's a great paper called Town Crier, came out way back in the day at Cornell."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "And that was all about using like SGX to scrape things and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "But you could also use those SGX cores to do contract processing, because if it runs in trusted hardware, then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "And because of that, you don't have to federate it or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device as if it was running on a cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "So there seems to be a desire in that community to capture more and more of the smart contract stack and pull more and more of that stack into that layer two infrastructure from running on layer one."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "Because you have cost reduction and potentially because your trust model collapses to whatever Chainlink is offering, you're not gaining anything by doing the computation on Ethereum or another platform."}, {"time": 7440, "text": "Because you ever watched The Simpsons?"}, {"time": 7442, "text": "There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "It is the perfect analogy for information security."}, {"time": 7449, "text": "So he and Smithers, they go through this elaborate series of doors and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit to get to the center of the power plant to turn off the power."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And when they arrive at the center of the plant, there's like this stray dog that's inside the room."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "And there's this wicker screen door that leads to the outside."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And you're like, well, why the hell did you go through this elaborate series of doors and things if there's like a backdoor into your system?"}, {"time": 7474, "text": "Well, that's basically a real life analogy of the relationship between the Oracle and the smart contract."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "You're only as good in your infrastructure model as your weakest link."}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And it doesn't matter if all of your computation is decentralized, if you're at the mercy of your data feed."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "Because I can just manipulate that and break the entire security model of the system, okay?"}, {"time": 7492, "text": "You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway, why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them and more value for them."}, {"time": 7504, "text": "But there are many different ways you can do oracles."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And earlier I was talking about the biology of these things, the cell differentiation."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system and you start having cells like stake pools or things that are on 24 seven, then you can start asking the what if question."}, {"time": 7522, "text": "Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?"}, {"time": 7526, "text": "Why don't you guys also provide state channels or payment channels or generate random numbers from here or whatever?"}, {"time": 7531, "text": "And you're now a service provider."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "You're making the blockchain full time, but part time you're doing this."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "And if you're making bagels, you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept."}, {"time": 7539, "text": "So I think that type of competition is going to be very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol, they have a built in trust advantage."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "They've already built a commercial reputation."}, {"time": 7556, "text": "There's already an increasingly more decentralized set."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "The other thing is you don't need a token."}, {"time": 7561, "text": "You can just use ADA."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "You don't need an oracle coin for these types of things to work."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "And by the way, that's just for the injection component and the veracity attestation."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "So is it true or not?"}, {"time": 7572, "text": "That's not about the aggregation."}, {"time": 7573, "text": "That's still a tremendously time intensive, expensive proposition."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "There's only a few people in the world that have what Steve has with Wolfram."}, {"time": 7581, "text": "And those guys by just cutting off those supply to replicate what they have is something that would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And so it's an interesting question of how do you incentivize decentralized aggregation of information?"}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And that's kind of what town crier and other protocols we're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "So maybe you can say how town crier works because it's like, what's your vision?"}, {"time": 7601, "text": "You're now partnering with Wolfram and Wolfram Alpha in sort of exploring this partnership of data and the blockchain."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "What's your vision for a possible distributed version of Wolfram Alpha?"}, {"time": 7616, "text": "Well, the first step is just say, can we use this as a feed?"}, {"time": 7619, "text": "And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "So you have a terminal and you have something and there's always a value of at least offering choice."}, {"time": 7626, "text": "And so it's not like we're anti chain link or picking winners and losers."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "It's an open protocol, it's an open system."}, {"time": 7631, "text": "So if we're successful, chain link will migrate or it will at least support us because they like money."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "They like users, they like liquidity."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "It's a disservice to their community not to support a potential customer set, but you're gonna have a spectrum from the desire to do a completely decentralized aggregation, curation, injection and veracity attestation to a completely centralized vertically integrated set."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "You need to be able to have that whole spectrum and offer that to the smart contract developer to decide what makes sense."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "By the way, a lot of cases, they're gonna be their own Oracle."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave, well, it's a completely centralized thing."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "It's a video game run by a single company."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "There's no sense in saying that we're somehow going to decentralize that."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "What they're just trying to do is extend their currency or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity and the world state of that, you just have to trust Blizzard to inject that into the system."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "You could try to imagine some sort of like, Sentinel group of people within the game who keep Blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency and cost reduction."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "So you'd want a single feed that gets injected into the system from them."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic and it's basing its value on the aggregation of many different exchanges, that's the polar opposite example."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "Because there you're saying, okay, what's the price of my asset relative to some basket?"}, {"time": 7725, "text": "But how do I know that the price feeds I'm looking at are accurate?"}, {"time": 7729, "text": "You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex and all these other things, or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges or something like that."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "Okay, well, how do you weight that?"}, {"time": 7737, "text": "And how do you clip outliers and these types of things?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "That's a completely different conversation."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "There's a lot more mechanics you have to put in for that bundling and attestation of the veracity of the data feed."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "And what happens if you get it wrong?"}, {"time": 7749, "text": "Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And the markets will eventually correct it for arbitrage seeking behavior, but anything that was built on that will fail in the short term."}, {"time": 7761, "text": "So Oracle is really just a game of, you have to build a standardized interfaces and make it as easy as possible for people to do that."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "And then let people choose how they wanna inject data and what level of assurance do they need behind that?"}, {"time": 7774, "text": "And the question is, how much do you leave to the user versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?"}, {"time": 7778, "text": "And it's a difficult design question."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram and they're a great company and they really have some bright people there."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And we know on the data set, they're second to none because not only do they have it, it's computable."}, {"time": 7791, "text": "You can do all kinds of things and manipulate with a very rich query language."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "And we wanna make sure that that's accessible to developers and Cardano."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "Remember, they're like Bloomberg."}, {"time": 7801, "text": "It's a centralized speed in that respect."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "So if you wanna build a Chainlink S competitor, there's other protocols you could do for that."}, {"time": 7809, "text": "Now you asked about Tom Cryer and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans with the net, get the data through a decentralized way."}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And that was just saying, hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read all kinds of websites and other things."}, {"time": 7824, "text": "And because it's trusted hardware, the scraping is nonbiased."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "If you find something inconvenient to whatever the person who's scraping is, trusted hardware will still do it and it can't be changed."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "So that's great, but you still run into the problem of how do you wire that together?"}, {"time": 7842, "text": "The underlying websites still don't have any notion of veracity or reputation behind them."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "And then you also have the issue of storage."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Where the hell do you put all of it?"}, {"time": 7851, "text": "If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that?"}, {"time": 7854, "text": "That's the dream of the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "I still think is a fascinating idea how to basically convert the internet into a core, like a knowledge base that you can query, you can integrate in the same way you did with Wolfram Alpha, but much bigger."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "But that means basically revolutionizing the way we put the internet together, which I think these ideas of off chain data will motivate people, because there's a lot of money to be made."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "Finally, there's money to be made with the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "So that'll be an interesting kind of future."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "I do want to ask you about video games really quick as a small tangent, because you said this really interesting idea of Blizzard being centralized control."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "Is it possible to have items in the game that are not controlled by Blizzard?"}, {"time": 7909, "text": "Being controlled in a decentralized fashion that you can, like what is it, the grandfather sword in Diablo?"}, {"time": 7916, "text": "Hmm, what was it really?"}, {"time": 7918, "text": "Somebody was criticizing me."}, {"time": 7919, "text": "I was saying all these kinds of nice things about Diablo III, and they said Diablo II Resurrected is coming out, they need to check it out."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "There's a lot of camps and wars that need to be done."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "Come on, we both know that Diablo II is far better than Diablo III."}, {"time": 7930, "text": "That's what they're saying."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "This is the war that they're having."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "Okay, so we'll play it, it's coming out soon, I'll play it, fine."}, {"time": 7937, "text": "But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "Is it possible to create video games where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard, and do you think in like a half century from now we will all live in those games, and we'll forget the physical space even exists?"}, {"time": 7955, "text": "Well, yeah, that's definitely possible."}, {"time": 7957, "text": "I look at CryptoKitties, that's a great example of that."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?"}, {"time": 7961, "text": "Well, it's basically just a video game that kind of lives on a blockchain, and the creatures within the game can breed with each other and create new CryptoKitties, and you can own them."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "So it's like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi with lots of money behind it."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "But anyway, the thing is those assets actually have a blockchain based representation."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "And so whether the infrastructure that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off, because that ledger exists outside of the game, any person can come in and replicate it, restore it, and turn it back on sans intellectual property."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "So yeah, it's completely possible to break your architecture up where you have a notion of the player part, and then you have a notion of the experience part, and you can interchange experiences, almost like you do cascading style sheets or something for different presentations, and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "So yeah, that's definitely doable."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And frankly, that's what's gonna happen in the gaming world, because there's so much value in that."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "I mean, everybody wants play, and right now the model is you make a game, you sell licenses, and you have a huge surge of people at the beginning of the game buying the video game, and then you have this long tail, but you've gotten almost 95% of your value in the first six months, and you have a huge churn rate."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "The odds are the vast majority of people won't be playing the game within 12 months."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "But if you can create an interactive game where there's an actual economy inside the game, then you have EVE Online, or Second Life, or any of these things, where you have people playing for 10 years, and there's like people buying virtual real estate and all these other things."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "You as the game developer actually don't have to create a lot of content."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "So your long tail gets a lot fatter, and it generates a lot more revenue, and your cost of operating the system is fairly fixed or diminishing."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "So the economics align for doing exactly what you're talking about, and I think it'll get done."}, {"time": 8070, "text": "Well, I just saw recently sort of this calculation that people played WoW and Fortnite for 140 billion hours."}, {"time": 8081, "text": "So, and that's without the economic incentives there."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "So do you think it's possible that like most of our economy in the future, people playing video games essentially?"}, {"time": 8092, "text": "Like, okay, so one vision of the future, especially with AI and automation, that people like, that we get wealthier and wealthier, there's this kind of rising GDP for the entire world, and then people are losing their jobs, but they're still well off enough to be able to have a high quality of life."}, {"time": 8111, "text": "So we're all looking for meaning, and the meaning we'll find is by playing video games, and now there's this extra levels, like you can be a Bill Gates within a video game world, in the digital world as opposed to the physical world."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "Is that, do you think that's the future?"}, {"time": 8124, "text":

{"time": 8132, "text": "Not yet, eventually."}, {"time": 8134, "text": "Well, yeah, but yeah, I guess, you know, Homo Dias, that's kind of like the roadmap there, right?"}, {"time": 8138, "text": "This hedonistic dystopia where everybody just lives wired into some simulation, and there's some movies about that, Ready Player One, and the other one was Surrogate, and so forth, so yeah, Hollywood

actual reality's tough, it's hard, you know, but then your knowledge that you live in a virtual world actually becomes a problem for you, so there's gonna be this kind of sad, dark industry where people try to create amnesia, where they're not aware that they're inside the virtual world, and so that's interesting."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "Why is it sad?"}, {"time": 8218, "text": "I mean,

we're talking about the future, let me ask you a timeline question, or even just like definitional."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "What is Alonzo?"}, {"time": 8417, "text": "You mentioned some fun Hello World experiments going on."}, {"time": 8422, "text": "And how and when will Cardano get smart contracts?"}, {"time": 8426, "text": "Yeah, so Alonzo Church is a famous, famous mathematician, computer science guy, and he was a contemporary of Turing."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "So we like functional programming, so we decided."}, {"time": 8446, "text": "That's your favorite Church."}, {"time": 8447, "text": "So we had to name something after Church, and it's just weird that we never did."}, {"time": 8452, "text": "So we said, okay, Alonzo is a good release name."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "Basically, it was bringing smart contracts to Cardano."}, {"time": 8456, "text": "Took us a long time to get here, and we'll be there in the next 90 days."}, {"time": 8460, "text": "It's like everything we do, there's a process, and so there's all the colors of the rainbow."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "We start with Alonzo blue, and then white, and purple."}, {"time": 8469, "text": "And each step, you do some more things."}, {"time": 8471, "text": "You bring more users in, and then eventually, you get to a threshold where you say, okay, everything works the way intended, and you push a button, and we initiate what's called a hard fork combinator event, and boom, the system has smart contracts."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "You just wake up, and it's there."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "It's like it's in your house."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "So it's gonna be a hard fork."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "It's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter, I woke up, and I had it."}, {"time": 8489, "text": "Yeah, and you were never the same."}, {"time": 8492, "text": "You can't go back."}, {"time": 8493, "text": "It's a, yeah, like hard fork."}, {"time": 8494, "text": "It's a hard fork of Charles."}, {"time": 8496, "text": "You got blue mark."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "Well, actually, I think you can take it away, but."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "Can they take my check mark away, Flex?"}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Oh, but that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "Okay, so great."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "So that's, but currently, there's a testing procedure going on to see what does that look like, and what will give you confidence that things are working well."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "Yeah, so first, you start with the marry era, which is where we're right now multi assets."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano, but you'd have limited programmability on chain."}, {"time": 8531, "text": "Alonzo adds the programmability in, but we already have most of the foundations of the extended UTXO model, and the smart contract model is just, those things aren't ready."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "So the first step is, say, fork it, so all those rules are now there, okay?"}, {"time": 8543, "text": "That's what we did with Alonzo Blue."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "We forked a testnet base layer, and it successfully survived going from marry to Alonzo, which means that you can move transactions from one side to the other."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Both systems work."}, {"time": 8555, "text": "And then the next step is, say, okay, well, are the stake pool operators, people who run the infrastructure, able to run this testnet just like they run Cardano?"}, {"time": 8562, "text": "And that's what we're doing right now with Blue."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "We're bringing all these SPOs in, and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts on the system?"}, {"time": 8569, "text": "And they actually return a round trip."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "You send something, you get something back."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "Yay, okay."}, {"time": 8575, "text": "And then what you do is each step, so the next is white, you go from like 50 people to several hundred, and then purple's an open testnet where we want every single person in the entire ecosystem to use it, and it's also a DevNet."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "So that means that people who are writing with Pluse Playground and local interpreters, their smart contracts can actually start testing them now on the public infrastructure."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox or something like that."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "You send them out to game developers before you release the Xbox, so they can test their video games in anticipation of the release of the system."}, {"time": 8607, "text": "So you run that for at least a month, and as long as it doesn't blow up in your face, and oh God, what have we done, Hindenburg, oh the humanity, you release it and you ship it."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "The problem is it's no longer in our control."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "There's over 100 exchanges that have listed Cardano."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "There's lots of wallet infrastructure."}, {"time": 8623, "text": "There are thousands of different constituencies."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "So it's less of a technological problem now, and it's more of a coordination problem."}, {"time": 8631, "text": "So you have to evolve in a very methodical way, and each step of the way you bring new actors in, they get ready for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "They upgrade their infrastructure to it, and then like shells, eventually, you get to the outer shell, which is the hard fork for the general public."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "And if we've done it right, like that blue check mark, they wake up and it's exactly the same."}, {"time": 8651, "text": "They just get a little update thing, update your client."}, {"time": 8654, "text": "And they start demanding Wagyu beef."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Is there stuff you're worried about in terms of like when something's this tricky, you know, goes up several orders of magnitudes in terms of scale?"}, {"time": 8665, "text": "Are there problems that you foresee?"}, {"time": 8667, "text": "Is there, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "Like what worries you the most?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I mean, I sleep like a baby."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "I wake up every two hours crying."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "And what makes no sense, I slept like a baby."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "But go ahead."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Yeah, yeah, exactly, right."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "Messing your whole world up right now, Alex."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "No, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat everyday when you have an ecosystem like this, cause you, you, the other thing is you're judged as much by the applications people build on the platform as you are by the platform you've constructed."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "So, you know, one of the most unfair things that happened in our industry was blaming Vitalik for the DAO hack."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "He didn't write the code, he wasn't responsible for it."}, {"time": 8716, "text": "It was a completely independent, different team."}, {"time": 8718, "text": "And because it blew up, a lot of people just developed this idea, Ethereum is not secure, the EBM is fundamentally broken."}, {"time": 8724, "text": "And it's true, there are some issues there, but come on, that's like saying, oh, well, Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "And that's the issue is you get, as a platform developer, coupled with the wins and losses of your application developer."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "So if they go do amazing things, it's like, oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it."}, {"time": 8745, "text": "And if they go do terrible things, they're like, oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So what we're kept up a night about is not just what we've constructed, but also how do we curate an ecosystem and foster the development of an ecosystem where you have assurance baked into the application, and that's somehow expressible to the user."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "So when you download your smart contract or you click your one click install, you use your unit swap clone or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on Cardano, you have a little green check mark or something that indicates to you that somebody audited the code or followed a specification."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "The lack of that is problematic because then first there's impersonations, the whole MyEtherWallet thing, like your videos or my videos are the same."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "Every comment, there's a bot that says, hey, give me some money or something like that."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "That kind of stuff happens."}, {"time": 8791, "text": "But then just protocol level flaws, like what happened with the DAO hack, that's what really keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "How do you resolve that problem?"}, {"time": 8798, "text": "Because I don't hire these people."}, {"time": 8800, "text": "I don't tell them what to do."}, {"time": 8801, "text": "I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "They may have tons of experience and knowledge."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "They could be Simon Payton Jones or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and they read one tutorial and they've written three lines of code their entire life and they've deployed something horribly broken, copy paste, and suddenly it all goes to hell."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "I'm judged by both."}, {"time": 8820, "text": "That's what really keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8821, "text": "And we're, as a company, trying to figure out, and as the ecosystem, trying to figure out standards."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "Like at University of Wyoming, we're setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "We're negotiating with them right now."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "And the goal there is just to create some standards for how to certify smart contracts so that you can get that green check mark and know that it actually has some assurance level behind it."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "But God, that's a huge coordination problem and it's a huge information presentation problem and incentives problem and so forth."}, {"time": 8849, "text": "And unfortunately, people who value being first to market will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "In terms of, maybe you can comment on the topic of decentralized exchanges."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "What kind of decentralized exchanges, DEXs, what are they, first of all, and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?"}, {"time": 8868, "text": "Yeah, so people want to create exchanges that don't have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8872, "text": "The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace where bids and asks can find each other, people can meet and trade."}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You can find a price and you can get liquidity."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that."}, {"time": 8888, "text": "So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "But it's centralized."}, {"time": 8891, "text": "But the problem is you have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "So when you put your gold and your dollars or your digital representations of these things into the exchange, what if Wally, Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad and he's gone to the dark side and he's become Wally the hacker."}, {"time": 8907, "text": "Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold and your tokens."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "So instead of you actually being able to swap these things, you've lost all your money."}, {"time": 8916, "text": "And there's other problems too."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "Like let's say Daisy has now come in and become a regulator and said, oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "I'm just gonna shut them all down."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "Yeah, and then you have no access to it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat, you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks maybe cutting you out."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Mt."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Gox was the most famous example of that."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "They collapsed, I believe in 2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost over the course of a while."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "So the point of a DEX is saying, can we do what a marketplace does, but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor run this thing?"}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And there's a lot of problems with that because exchanges are generally creatures of latency."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "You know, high frequency trading, for example, the things that nanosecond, they co locate their infrastructure with the exchange software just so they can front run orders over other people."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange is very centralized, very fast, very optimized and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules."}, {"time": 8984, "text": "When you look at a DEX, you have to accept that you're gonna have to have slightly different rules because you're operating in a global systems latency and you're operating in a system that has different behaviors."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for it."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years and we've seen a huge competition and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols that kind of excuse some of these security problems, enjoy high liquidity and then also have this beautiful concept of openness."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "One of the gatekeepers to crypto when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "I remember when we first created Cardano, you know, the Bitfinex guys reached out to the Cardano Foundation."}, {"time": 9024, "text": "They said, oh, we'd be happy to list ADA."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it."}, {"time": 9030, "text": "You know, so there was kind of some Italian for go fuck yourself in those email conversations."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "Fuck, hula is what I said."}, {"time": 9039, "text": "But anyway, that kind of back and forth happens all the time."}, {"time": 9042, "text": "And because these guys are gatekeepers, they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries and so forth."}, {"time": 9048, "text": "So having a DEX, you don't have that problem."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "You have open listing and you basically just put the asset into it."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "And if anybody wants to trade it, they will."}, {"time": 9056, "text": "And if it seems like it's a good idea, a natural market will form, market making will occur and you get liquidity with it."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now is the concept of regulation."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "So basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML, know your customer and anti money laundering."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "So basically who are you and you know, is your money real or not, or are you a drug dealer or something?"}, {"time": 9084, "text": "So normally you do that by saying, okay, I'm gonna give them my copy of my passport and maybe they're gonna request some tax records or whatever the best practices are for the particular jurisdiction."}, {"time": 9094, "text": "And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So if the government comes in and says, hey guys, you know, pull your compliance records and they find discrepancies, they'll actually put the exchange out of business or fine them very heavily."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in fines over the last 20 years for various compliance issues amongst other things."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "So it's expensive, very difficult thing."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "And at DEX, it's open system."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "You just have value coming in, not identity."}, {"time": 9123, "text": "And so all these things are trading amongst anonymous accounts."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "And so there's no notion of compliance right now for that."}, {"time": 9129, "text": "So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying, oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism and drug dealing and bad stuff."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "And they're word salad of bullshit."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "But you know, it is what it is."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "You have to deal with these guys."}, {"time": 9140, "text": "And so there's been a lot of discussions of, can we take DEXs and keep the openness and keep the liquidity and no counterpart or custodial risk?"}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And can we add some notion of compliance to that in a decentralized way that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?"}, {"time": 9157, "text": "So I think actually by combining DIDs, decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "But it's actually the next generation of the technology is the regulated DEX and who regulates that, how does that work and so forth."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "But I think ultimately those are gonna be the only marketplaces that end up surviving in this current environment if your desire is to exit to a dollar."}, {"time": 9176, "text": "If you don't really care about the fiat side, like a traditional legacy currency, you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way."}, {"time": 9185, "text": "But I mean, it's a personal preference and a business preference."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "Can we kind of return to proof of work and proof of stake?"}, {"time": 9193, "text": "There's just so many topics I wanna talk to you about."}, {"time": 9195, "text": "So I'll jump around a little bit."}, {"time": 9197, "text": "But at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey spoke, I think I believe he said Bitcoin changes everything."}, {"time": 9205, "text": "I think he made a video for Jack trying to explain different ideas to him."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "I guess describing the difference between proof of work and proof of stake as we've talked about."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "What do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand about the difference between proof of work and proof of stake?"}, {"time": 9220, "text": "Well, I hope he understands it's just a resource."}, {"time": 9222, "text": "That's the entire point of the video I was trying to make is like, dude, you're like in this cult where you think the only way to be secure is proof of worker and somehow proof of stake is less secure than proof of work."}, {"time": 9232, "text": "I don't even know how you put those inequalities there because you're talking about apples and oranges."}, {"time": 9237, "text": "You're making different trade offs and there's different assumptions about the nature of the people involved, but the mechanics are the same."}, {"time": 9244, "text": "And so it's really more of a question of what type of system do you prefer?"}, {"time": 9248, "text": "Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome or do you want Roman citizens guarding Rome?"}, {"time": 9253, "text": "Okay, and as the Romans learn, it's better to have citizens usually doing that."}, {"time": 9256, "text": "Okay, and that's the only point I was trying to make to Dorsey and I don't think he watched it or particularly cared, but it was more of a video for everyone."}, {"time": 9266, "text": "And to start that dialogue of realizing that the real game is not, is proof of stake better than proof of work?"}, {"time": 9273, "text": "It's how do we go from one to end and what should end be?"}, {"time": 9276, "text": "You just mentioned that semantical addressable web, going back to IPFS and these other concepts."}, {"time": 9281, "text": "Well, how do you pay for the enormous burden of storing that much data?"}, {"time": 9286, "text": "You can create a consensus protocol for it."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "There actually is one."}, {"time": 9289, "text": "It's called Permacoin, came out in 2014, 15."}, {"time": 9291, "text": "Andrew Miller wrote it and a few other authors."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "I think John Katz may have been an author as well."}, {"time": 9297, "text": "But basically it was just a throwaway proof of work style algorithm that only works if you have large amounts of data."}, {"time": 9305, "text": "Okay, so it's like your miner is like a hard drive effectively."}, {"time": 9309, "text": "Proof of storage, I think you call it."}, {"time": 9311, "text": "Yeah, this type of stuff."}, {"time": 9312, "text": "And there's been since then many iterations, evolutions of that type of protocol."}, {"time": 9317, "text": "Okay, so what if you throw that into your resource back?"}, {"time": 9320, "text": "Now you have a capacity in your system for storing huge amounts of information."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "That's incentivized by the way the system works."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "And you can balance that with a proof of stake system."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "And you can balance that with, let's say you have proof of useful computation."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "We may have a paper on that, who knows, coming soon."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "And what if you have a proof of useful computation where maybe you can do walk stat or something, who knows?"}, {"time": 9341, "text": "With something like that, okay, well now you have three resources inside your system and those three things keep your system secure."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "They keep each other balanced."}, {"time": 9348, "text": "And they just so happen to create the world's largest supercomputer that's programmable."}, {"time": 9353, "text": "And it just so happens to create the world's largest database that's programmable."}, {"time": 9356, "text": "In addition to having a shareholder style model for ownership inside of it, to kind of balance these things out."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "So people care about the appreciation of value inside the system."}, {"time": 9365,

becomes part of Cash App?"}, {"time": 9427, "text": "I mean, he's a business guy, or at least I'd hope he is, and it's not about what I want or what he wants, it's about what markets want."}, {"time": 9434, "text": "When you run a publicly traded company, you have fiduciary obligation to your shareholders to maximize the utility, sustainability, and value of your company."}, {"time": 9443, "text":

"The next thing you do is composition."}, {"time": 10637, "text": "So you go multiple heads, and there's a routing protocol between them."}, {"time": 10640, "text": "And then eventually create these tail protocols for when things get asynchronous."}, {"time": 10644, "text": "So instead of always being aligned, and always being available, what happens if they die for a bit, and then they come back?"}, {"time": 10650, "text": "And you can create all kinds of guarantees that your funds won't be lost, or locked forever, or things like that."}, {"time": 10655, "text": "There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff."}, {"time": 10657, "text": "And basically the idea is leverage what Lightning has already achieved with Bitcoin, but then take advantage of the fact that you have a more expressive accounting model, and a more expressive programming model, so you can just physically do more, and you can put more crypto into that thing."}, {"time": 10672, "text": "Now contrast it with rollups, really that is just saying, you're gonna take some thing, batch a bunch of transactions together, and you're gonna generate a proof."}, {"time": 10680, "text": "And then what you can do is whenever you see some part of that history, you can check it against that proof that's rolled up."}, {"time": 10685, "text": "And they're closely related concept of recursive snarks that you'll see a lot."}, {"time": 10689, "text": "Things like the MENA protocol, or other things."}, {"time": 10691, "text": "And basically the idea is that whenever you see something, you can always generate two proofs."}, {"time": 10696, "text": "An existential proofs that the coins exist, and a non existence of a double spend."}, {"time": 10701, "text": "So you can always check those two properties."},

"The actual proof is concise, okay?"}, {"time": 10713, "text": "So they're just different boats for different floats."}, {"time": 10715, "text": "The advantage of a layer two network where there's actual channels, and there's interaction, and there's service providers, is the channels can eventually scale in the collection of things that they can do."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "And eventually they can become interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies."}, {"time": 10731, "text": "So at some point, we could modify the bolt spec, and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra."},

chain, so can you elaborate how it's possible to do cross chain traffic?"}, {"time": 10752, "text": "Well, you already have the intermediary, you have the channel operator, and you already have lightning protocol, right?"}, {"time": 10758, "text": "And you just build a dex that runs within that system, and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So you lock it."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So it would be like low cost?"}, {"time": 10766, "text": "I guess you could just switch low."}, {"time": 10768, "text": "Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one, will let you batch the other."}, {"time": 10771, "text": "So if lightning works on Bitcoin, and Hydra works on Cardano, you can eventually bridge these two together, and create a way of moving back and forth."}, {"time": 10777, "text": "And the same things that make transactions in and out of that network cheap, will make creating wrapped assets cheap."}, {"time": 10783, "text": "At least

layer two technologies in general?"}, {"time": 10792, "text": "Is there stuff you're excited about?"}, {"time": 10793, "text": "We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network, Hydra, and these ideas."}, {"time": 10797, "text": "Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out, or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing that we just keep building different ideas, and they all interact with each other?"}, {"time": 10805, "text": "It goes back to biology, that cell differentiation concept, is you have to build specialized tissue to do these things."}, {"time": 10811, "text": "The point of layer two is to extend the network."}, {"time": 10813, "text": "It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm, it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes, giving you additional senses, you have ears now."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "So when you add these layer two protocols, like Atala Prism is a perfect example of that."}, {"time": 10824, "text": "We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano."}, {"time": 10827, "text": "It's a real bad deal to do that, because then China will come in, or US will come in and tell you how to do that."}, {"time": 10832, "text": "What you do is you build a layer two protocol that's blockchain agnostic, and then the user can decide when and where they need an identity, and then bring that identity into the system."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "And if you designed it right, when they bring it in, it's very easy, very fluid, and suddenly the experience enhances."}, {"time": 10847, "text": "Everything just gets better."}, {"time": 10849, "text": "Oh, wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things."}, {"time": 10851, "text": "They go from gray to green in the App Store."}, {"time": 10855, "text": "Or, oh, wow, now I can send to human readable addresses, because if I have an identity and you have an identity, we can alias them with some namespace, and now I sent a Lex instead of some horrible back 32 address structure."}, {"time": 10868, "text": "Okay, so that's really what you need to do with layer two is say, okay, each layer two protocol is meant to do something."}, {"time": 10874, "text": "Either it gives me payments, or lower cost smart contracts, or interoperability, or identity, and then it's a marketplace."}, {"time": 10881, "text": "So you should have blockchain agnosticism with your layer two solutions."}, {"time": 10885, "text": "And so you can mix and match and choose whichever collection of services you need."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "And that's actually how IT works these days with microservices and these other things, and cloud software, you know."}, {"time": 10895, "text": "Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers, and basically that composition of them is your software stack."}, {"time": 10903, "text": "Jumping around back to proof of work."}, {"time": 10905, "text": "What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?"}, {"time": 10913, "text": "NIPOPOWS, it's fun to say, right?"}, {"time": 10915, "text": "It's just one of those things that you notice that certain proofs of work, when you solve them, come up less frequently than other ones."}, {"time": 10922, "text": "And just by that nature, you can sample them and then construct proofs from them."}, {"time": 10927, "text": "So you can, with that just set, have a more concise representation of an amount of work for a range of the chain."}, {"time": 10934, "text": "So that works."}, {"time": 10935, "text": "Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad, basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block, and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot."}, {"time": 10942, "text": "This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work, and then this block, you get a green, and you keep going, and then suddenly you get a red one."}, {"time": 10951, "text": "So it's still a valid proof of work, but it's more rare than the other ones."}, {"time": 10955, "text": "So if you notice that particular pattern, what you can do is you can just start not caring so much about the green ones, and you can just bookend your chain with red."}, {"time": 10964, "text": "And then you can just repeat that, and repeat that, repeat that, and you can collect, and you can create this really compressed representation of these things."}, {"time": 10971, "text": "So what does it mean?"}, {"time": 10972, "text": "It means that suddenly when you have that, now you have a way of representing a long range of history with a very small proof."}, {"time": 10980, "text": "So you can use it for light wallets, and you also can use it for side chains, if both side chains use proof of work."}, {"time": 10987, "text": "So when you see a transaction come in, you don't have a copy of the side chain, but you have a copy of the proof of work, and it has the same algorithmic weight as the normal longest chain, because you don't have all the greens, but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency."}, {"time": 11001, "text": "So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zintros and Agelos, and it's just an amazing paper, and what's so cool about it is it doesn't require any structural changes to proof of work."}, {"time": 11011, "text": "It's just something you notice as an off gas of proof of work."}, {"time": 11014, "text": "It's like you're watching an engine operate, and you notice like every 500 times a piston will do a certain weird thing, and so you take advantage of that."}, {"time": 11022, "text": "You say, well, if I count 10 of them, now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes, as I observed that pattern."}, {"time": 11028, "text": "And so it's the same concept there, and it's just a property of the engine."}, {"time": 11032, "text": "So you don't really need to hard fork it in."}, {"time": 11034, "text": "It's just there, and because you can build proofs that way, now you can use those proofs to do like clients, and you can use those proofs to do other things, because you can just use that as something that comes with the history."}, {"time": 11043, "text": "You don't have to have the whole blockchain."}, {"time": 11044, "text": "Now, is this a weird property of multiple proof of work chains?"}, {"time": 11048, "text": "It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm, but usually there's some portability in this type of thing."}, {"time": 11055, "text": "Like we're right now exploring, can you do NIPA piles with Prism or any of these sharded proof of work protocols, but it looks like you can."}, {"time": 11061, "text": "The closely related is log space mining."}, {"time": 11063, "text": "So you can use this concept, and instead of having the entire blockchain to be able to mine, you can use a compressed representation of it."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining that basically explains how to do that."}, {"time": 11073, "text": "So your miner only has this very small micro ledger as opposed to the entire ledger."}, {"time": 11080, "text": "How does it connect back to the entire ledger?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "How does the compressed?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "Because you have those red blocks."}, {"time": 11085, "text": "You have those special things, and so you know that the state you're working on is actually legitimate, right?"}, {"time": 11091, "text": "So the map goes both ways?"}, {"time": 11092, "text": "Yep, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 11095, "text": "Wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 11096, "text": "Yeah, and Denis is a genius."}, {"time":

lot of great papers on it."}, {"time": 11116, "text": "And that was a testimony to hard work for getting the paper published, because the paper came out in 2016, but I think it took three or four years for it to go through peer review."}, {"time": 11125, "text": "He kept trying to push it one conference after another rejection, after another rejection, but he got it through."}, {"time": 11130,

they're much more focused around how is your product building out."}, {"time": 13708, "text": "And by the way, we're gonna add more infrastructure over time."}, {"time": 13710, "text": "Our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson, she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator."}, {"time": 13715, "text": "And we have lots of cool partners we've talked with in that space."}, {"time": 13718, "text": "And it's the same concept."}, {"time": 13719, "text": "Your idea comes in, what enters the system should not be what gets approved on the other side."}, {"time": 13724, "text": "It should go through some sort of gauntlet, some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur."}, {"time": 13735, "text": "And then by the time you get to the other side, either the idea just dies on the vine because it was a bad idea, or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing and potentially even gets attached with accountability."}, {"time": 13745, "text": "So you don't just fund the idea, you'd actually fund the auditor at the same time who actually holds the person accountable because the blockchain is not a real company."}, {"time": 13752, "text": "It's an ethereal thing."}, {"time": 13754, "text": "You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding."}, {"time": 13759, "text": "So that's what we're doing this year."}, {"time": 13761, "text": "So we have a whole team of people, partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale and papers we've written and about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this."}, {"time": 13770, "text": "So it's a huge social experiment and we're learning an enormous amount."}, {"time": 13774, "text": "And then our goal is by the end of the year to have a meaningful percentage of the entire Cardinal population inside of it, like 40, 50%."}, {"time": 13781, "text": "Then once you're at that threshold, now you have democratic majority of the entire system and you can have a real conversation about, okay, how do we write a constitution for this type of a system?"}, {"time": 13791, "text": "And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution, people still argue about it because natural language, much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations."}, {"time": 13800, "text": "Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas that reduce the ambiguity?"}, {"time": 13807, "text": "Everything's old is new again."}, {"time": 13809,

is why I'm so interested in things like Idris and Koch and Acta and theorem proving, because that's exactly what you're attempting to do is to express some concept or desire or construction in a language that's machine understandable and manipulatable."}, {"time": 13830, "text": "In particular, how does the system know its own design?"}, {"time": 13833, "text": "So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 13835, "text": "Usually it's a canonical code base, like here's Bitcoin core and the C++ code is that is the canonical code base."}, {"time": 13842, "text": "But actually that's not right."}, {"time": 13843, "text": "You should have specifications, blueprints that are implementation agnostic as your canonical code base."}, {"time": 13849, "text": "And can your system know those specifications, understand those specifications, and can your change management system be for that?"}, {"time": 13855, "text": "And then can you provide a proof that your client is by similar to that specification?"}, {"time": 13860, "text": "So yeah, that's 10 years in the future, but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept."}, {"time": 13865, "text": "But you're tending towards a formalism."}, {"time": 13868, "text": "Eventually, but that's not necessary for the system in the short term."}, {"time": 13872, "text": "It's good enough just to have, I know in a winter and say the Haskell client is that, and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP and then once it's approved, then you go and implement that."}, {"time": 13884, "text": "And there's some mechanism to trigger the update system, to update the reference client."}, {"time": 13887, "text": "Do you have an example of a SIP, a Cardano Improvement Proposal?"}, {"time": 13891, "text": "Yeah, like the Curb Benefit Pledge, SIP 007."}, {"time": 13894, "text": "So the... 007."}, {"time": 13898, "text": "Yeah, everybody loves that."}, {"time": 13900, "text": "Yeah, key."}, {"time": 13901, "text": "I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex."}, {"time": 13905, "text": "So basically it just has to do with the pledge."}, {"time": 13910, "text": "So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA that a stake pool operator will set aside and connect to his pool in order to be listed in the registry."}, {"time": 13919, "text": "And actually it's connected to how much income you make as a pool operator."}, {"time": 13923, "text": "So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation, you have lots of pools."}, {"time": 13928, "text": "If you set it too low, what will happen is larger pools will tend to fragment and actually run multiple instances of themselves."}, {"time": 13935, "text": "And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak."}, {"time": 13938, "text": "And so we have a formula for it, our formal specification that's quite involved."}, {"time": 13942, "text": "And so one of the community members came and said, well, I think we can massively simplify this design and actually get a better result for smaller stake pool operators."}, {"time": 13950, "text": "And so it's SIP 007."}, {"time": 13953, "text": "And there's actually a lot of conversation and people are thinking about it."}, {"time": 13955, "text": "And it was just stunning for me because to understand how to write a SIP like this, you actually have to read like a hundred pages of mathematical prose in the formal specification."}, {"time": 13964, "text": "So the guys who wrote it, I was like, fuck yeah."}, {"time": 13968, "text": "I'll just say an example of a SIP, but that's one thing, but it could be as big as, hey, I wanna add like quantum resistance to the system."}, {"time": 13975, "text": "And here's how you do that, like quantum VRF and I wanna put XMSS and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 13980, "text": "So there's a lot you can do and you can do it indirectly or implicitly where there's some social process outside of the system where you eventually approve a SIP, or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote or some representative democracy, some group of representatives directly votes."}, {"time": 13999, "text": "And then once you've decided it's there."}, {"time": 14001, "text": "The constitution is necessary because you need to know the decision threshold."}, {"time": 14004, "text": "Is it super majority or majority?"}, {"time": 14006, "text": "And also the voting process."}, {"time": 14009, "text": "Like a lot of policy experts believe that if Brexit was a multi stage vote, it would have never passed because people would have done the initial stage and all the horrors of Brexit would have been broadcast to society."}, {"time": 14019, "text": "And then there would have been some reluctance and buyer's remorse on it."}, {"time": 14022, "text": "And then the second round would have failed or something like that."}, {"time": 14025, "text": "But because it was just a singular event, it's like they passed it now, British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign."}, {"time": 14032, "text": "Very well, we shall remove from Europe."}, {"time": 14035, "text": "And so your voting system has a lot to do with the outcome you get."}, {"time": 14039, "text": "The other thing is, what type of voting?"}, {"time": 14041, "text": "Is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting?"}, {"time": 14044, "text": "So you pick your favorite SIP, follow your second favorite SIP or something like that."}, {"time": 14048, "text": "So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems like that."}, {"time": 14051, "text": "Are you a fan of those, like the ranked choice vote?"}, {"time": 14053, "text": "I love them so much, especially for political diversity because this whole concept of throwing your vote away, if it's Alice or Bob,

preference voting, you never have that situation because you always pick your favorite and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot."}, {"time": 14078, "text": "But then you have arrows paradox and all these other things that come up."}, {"time": 14081, "text": "So there's no perfect system."}, {"time": 14084, "text": "And really you have to be comfortable with governance in a game of inches."},

you have a lot more people on for the ride when you actually start talking about these bigger and bigger things."}, {"time": 14107, "text": "The other challenge was that we had to decentralize development of the protocol and the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14112, "text": "We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14115, "text": "The peer review academic

what's nice about Legends of Valor is it's a blank slate."}, {"time": 16657, "text": "You can do your own Elder Scrolls, you can create your own class system and level system and so forth."}, {"time": 16662, "text": "You could write some beautiful, exciting, fun narratives for that."}, {"time": 16666, "text": "And also it gives me a chance to explore a lot of things I think should be dragged into

much smaller."}, {"time": 16680, "text": "So you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack."}, {"time": 16682, "text": "So what if you could connect the music to the state of the game world and it automatically through some process will generate music."}, {"time": 16689, "text": "And there's actually people who study this."}, {"time": 16691, "text": "And so that's one dimension."}, {"time": 16692, "text": "The other thing is you have things like GPT3 and so forth."}, {"time": 16695, "text": "There was a great game, Event Zero, and it came out like 2016 where you could actually have a dialogue with an AI and you're like a marooned astronaut on a space station that's abandoned."}, {"time": 16708, "text": "And you have to somehow work with this AI through communicating with it to convince you to take you home."}, {"time": 16714, "text": "But the AI is a bit duplicitous."}, {"time": 16717, "text": "And I don't wanna spoil the plot of the game because it's such a cool game, but

the AI will reply to you back and forth."}, {"time": 16730, "text": "And this was 2016 and it's like things have gotten an order of magnitude better."}, {"time": 16734, "text": "So the evolution of that tech, I think within the next five years, brought into video games could give you incredibly cool dialogue inside the game."}, {"time": 16742, "text": "So algorithmically generated music, better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics."}, {"time": 16746, "text": "Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems, alternative geometries like hyperbolic geometry or these types of things."}, {"time": 16755, "text": "And there's actually Hyperbolica is a game that does that."}, {"time": 16759, "text": "And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well and bring those elements into a game design."}, {"time": 16763, "text": "And that's what we'll do with Legends of Valor."}, {"time": 16765, "text": "So it'll be kind of like Skyrim, but with a lot of really cool new shit."}, {"time": 16768, "text": "It's kind of like, I saw Aerosmith years ago and he was out there, he's like, do you like the old shit?"}, {"time": 16772, "text": "Do you like new shit?"}, {"time": 16774, "text": "Kind of middle shit, you know?"}, {"time": 16777, "text": "So you're going for the middle."}, {"time": 16778, "text": "Yeah, I'm gonna try to do some of the old and some of the new and bring it in."}, {"time": 16781, "text": "So that'll be a lot of fun."}, {"time": 16783, "text": "And what's nice about it is that there is a lot of new play in the market because of the Microsoft acquisition of Bethesda."}, {"time": 16794, "text": "They've been losing employees like crazy and there's a lot of belief that Elder Scrolls 6 will not live up to expectations because Microsoft will kill it."}, {"time": 16801, "text": "I will tweet."}, {"time": 16802, "text": "Okay, listen to me."}, {"time": 16803, "text": "I will go into, I'm all about love on the internet, but I will go hard at you Microsoft if you screw up Elder Scrolls."}, {"time": 16811, "text": "Well, we might have to do a spiritual successor, right?"}, {"time": 16814, "text": "It might have to happen with Legends of Valor."}, {"time": 16817, "text": "But it's a passion project, so I have no time for it at all."}, {"time": 16820, "text": "It's like solo on my list of things to do."}, {"time": 16822, "text": "So I'll probably do it in 2022, 2023 and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it in Wyoming, probably in Wheatland or some really small town and we'll import everybody and then we'll have to build the whole city up like Elon is doing here in Texas."}, {"time": 16834, "text": "It'll be a fun project."}, {"time": 16836, "text": "Well, I like programmatically generated music."}, {"time": 16838,

music?"}, {"time": 16844, "text": "Yeah, for doing it."}, {"time": 16845, "text": "I wonder how successful that could be because I remember Baldur's Gate was the first game where I realized music is so important to the game."}, {"time": 16852, "text": "It was the thing I remembered about the game."}, {"time": 16854, "text": "It was the reason that, it was the thing I thought about when I was away from the game is like the feeling it created, that music."}, {"time": 16862, "text": "I don't even remember the music anymore, but I remember the music."}, {"time": 16865, "text": "Bum, bum, dum, dum."}, {"time": 16868, "text": "Jeremy Soule, I think was the composer."}, {"time": 16872, "text": "And actually getting like Raman Juwadi or Bear McCready in to do that, that would be so cool."},

like where do you fit?"}, {"time": 16926, "text": "And it has this incredible plot where you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin that gets shot down and you get dragged into this conspiracy and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy as you go through the whole game world."}, {"time": 16938, "text": "And you meet all these different races like the elves and the dwarves and so forth."},
