we wanna be remembered is what kind of people we were, right?"}, {"time": 426, "text": "Devoted mother, loving father, what kind of person we were to other people."}, {"time": 430, "text": "Jack Welch just died recently, and the Washington Post, when it wrote the headline for his obit, it wrote, he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And that's his legacy."}, {"time": 444, "text": "A finite player who is obsessed with winning, who leaves behind a legacy of short term gains for a few and distress for many."}, {"time": 453, "text": "That's his legacy."}, {"time": 454, "text": "And every single one of us gets the choice of the kind of legacy we wanna have."}, {"time": 459, "text": "Do we wanna be remembered for our contributions or our detractions?"}, {"time": 463, "text": "To live with a finite mindset, to live a career with a finite mindset, to be number one, be the best, be the most famous, you live a life like Jack Welch, you know?"}, {"time": 476, "text": "To live a life of service, to see those around us rise, to contribute to our communities, to our organizations, to leave them in better shape than we found them, that's the kind of legacy most of us would like to have."}, {"time": 487, "text": "So day to day, when you think about what is the fundamental goals, dreams, motivations of an infinite game, of seeing your life, your career as an infinite game, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 506, "text": "I mean, I guess I'm sort of trying to stick on this personal ego, personal drive, the thing that the fire, the reason we wanna wake up in the morning and the reason we can't go to bed because we're so excited, what is that?"}, {"time": 519, "text": "So for me, it's about having a just cause."}, {"time": 521, "text": "It's about a vision that's bigger than me, that my work gets to contribute to something larger than myself, you know?"}, {"time": 528, "text": "That's what drives me every day."}, {"time": 531, "text": "I wake up every morning with a vision of a world that does not yet exist, a world in which the vast majority of people wake up every single morning inspired, feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day."}, {"time": 542, "text": "It is not the world we live in."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And so that we still have work to do is the thing that drives me."}, {"time": 548, "text": "You know, I know what my underlying values are."}, {"time": 550, "text": "You know, I wake up to inspire people to do the things that inspire them."}, {"time": 553, "text": "And these are the things that, these are the things that I, these are my go tos, my touch points that inspire me to keep working."}, {"time": 561, "text": "You know, I think of a career like an iceberg."}, {"time": 564, "text": "You know, if you have a vision for something, you're the only one who can see the iceberg underneath the ocean."}, {"time": 570, "text": "But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up."}, {"time": 573, "text": "And now a few other people can see what you imagine, be like, oh, right, yeah, no, I wanna help build that as well."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And if you have a lot of success, then you have a lot of iceberg and people can see this huge iceberg and they say, you've accomplished so much."}, {"time": 583, "text": "But what I see is all the work still yet to be done."}, {"time": 587, "text": "You know, I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And so the growth, you talk about momentum."}, {"time": 592, "text": "So the incremental revealing of the iceberg is what drives you."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Well, it necessarily is incremental."}, {"time": 600, "text": "What drives me is that, is the realization, is realizing the iceberg, bringing more of the iceberg from the unknown to the known, bringing more of the vision from the imagination to reality."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And you have this fundamental vision of optimism."}, {"time": 615, "text": "You call yourself an optimist."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I mean, in this world, I have a sort of, I see myself a little bit as the main character from The Idiot by Dostoevsky, who is also kind of seen by society as a fool because he was optimistic."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So one, can you maybe articulate where that sense of optimism comes from?"}, {"time": 637, "text": "And maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future where people are inspired, where optimism drives us."}, {"time": 646, "text": "It's easy to forget that when you look at social media and so on, where the word toxicity and negativity can often get more likes, that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it."}, {"time": 656, "text": "And I do hope it's out there."}, {"time": 658, "text": "So can you try to articulate that vision?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud."}, {"time": 668, "text": "Even in tragedy, it brings people together."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And the question is, can we see that?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "Can you see the beauty that is in everything?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "And I don't think optimism is foolishness."}, {"time": 680, "text": "I don't think optimism is blindness, though it probably involves some naivete, the belief that things will get better, the belief that we tend towards the good, even in times of struggle or bad."}, {"time": 699, "text": "You can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace."}, {"time": 702, "text": "I think things that are stable are more sustainable, things that are optimistic are more sustainable than things that are chaotic."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So you see people as fundamentally good."}, {"time": 714, "text": "I mean, some people may disagree that you can't sustain peace, you can't sustain war."}, {"time": 720, "text": "I mean, I think war is costly."}, {"time": 723, "text": "It involves life and money, and peace does not involve those things."}, {"time": 728, "text": "It requires work."}, {"time": 729, "text": "I'm not saying it doesn't require work, but it doesn't drain resources, I think the same way that war does."}, {"time": 737, "text": "The people that would say that we will always have war, and I just talked to the historian of Stalin, would say that conflict and the desire for power and conflict is central to human nature."}, {"time": 750, "text": "I concur."}, {"time": 752, "text": "But something in your words also, perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share, is that you have an optimism that people are fundamentally good."}, {"time": 761, "text": "I'm an idealist, and I think idealism is good."}, {"time": 764, "text": "I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals that I imagine can come true."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Of course, there'll never be world peace, but shouldn't we die trying?"}, {"time": 773, "text": "I think that's the whole point."}, {"time": 774, "text": "That's the whole point of vision."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Vision should be idealistic, and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible."}, {"time": 782, "text": "But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and it's the milestones that we reach that take us closer to that ideal that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning, and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves."}, {"time": 794, "text": "You know, just because it's impossible doesn't mean we shouldn't try."}, {"time": 799, "text": "As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field."}, {"time": 801, "text": "We're still making progress."}, {"time": 803, "text": "Things are still getting better, even if we never get to that ideal state."}, {"time": 807, "text": "So I think idealism is a good thing."}, {"time": 810, "text": "You know, in the word infinite game, one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life, human life at least, at least from the biological perspective, is that it ends."}, {"time": 823, "text": "So sadly, it's."}, {"time": 824, "text": "To some people, yeah."}, {"time": 826, "text": "Fine, it's tragic to some people, or is it ends, it ends?"}, {"time": 830, "text": "I think some people believe that it ends on the day you die, and some people think it continues on."}, {"time": 834, "text": "There's, and there's a lot of different ways to think what continues on even looks like."}, {"time": 838, "text": "But let me drag it back to the personal."}, {"time": 842, "text": "Which is, how do you think about your own mortality?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "How do you think about your own death?"}, {"time": 850, "text": "I definitely haven't accomplished everything I want to contribute to."}, {"time": 855, "text": "I would like more time on this earth to keep working towards that vision."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?"}, {"time": 862, "text": "Are you cognizant of it?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "Of course I'm cognizant of it."}, {"time": 864, "text": "I mean, aren't we all?"}, {"time": 867, "text": "I don't dwell on it."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I'm aware of it."}, {"time": 872, "text": "I know that my life is finite, and I know that I have a certain amount of time left on this planet, and I'd like to make that time be valuable."}, {"time": 880, "text": "You know, some people would think that ideas kind of allow you to have a certain kind of immortality."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Maybe to linger on this kind of question."}, {"time": 894, "text": "So first to push back on the, you said that everyone's cognizant of their mortality."}, {"time": 898, "text": "There's a guy named Ernest Becker who would disagree, that you basically say that most of human cognition is created by us trying to create an illusion and try to hide the fact from ourselves, the fact that we're gonna die, to try to think that it's all gonna go on forever."}, {"time": 917, "text": "But the fact that we know that it doesn't."}, {"time": 919, "text": "Yes, but this mix of denial."}, {"time": 921, "text": "I mean, I think the book's called Denial of Death."}, {"time": 924, "text": "It's this constant denial that we're running away from."}, {"time": 930, "text": "In fact, some would argue that the inspiration, the incredible ideas you've put out there, your TED Talk has been seen by millions and millions of people, right?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "It's just you trying to desperately fight the fact that you are biologically mortal."}, {"time": 945, "text": "Your creative genius comes from the fact that you're trying to create ideas that live on long past you."}, {"time": 952, "text": "Well, that's very nice of you."}, {"time": 953, "text": "I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me because I think that is a good test that those ideas have value in the lives of others."}, {"time": 963, "text": "I think that's a good test."}, {"time": 965, "text": "That others would continue to talk about or share the ideas long after I'm gone, I think is perhaps the greatest compliment one can get for one's own work."}, {"time": 980, "text": "But I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality that drives me to do it."}, {"time": 985, "text": "It's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it."}, {"time": 990, "text": "It's the optimist vision."}, {"time": 992, "text": "It's the pleasure and the fulfillment you get from inspiring others."}, {"time": 998, "text": "It's as pure as that."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Let me ask, listen, I'm rushing."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "I'm trying to get you to get you into these dark areas."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "Is the ego tied up into it somehow?"}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So your name is extremely well known."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "If your name wasn't attached to it, do you think you would act differently?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "I mean, for years, I hated that my name was attached to it."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have my face on the front page of the website."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "I had a fight with the publisher because I didn't want my name big on the book."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "I wanted it tiny on the book."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Because I kept telling them it's not about me, it's about the ideas."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "They wanted to put my name on the top of my book, I refused."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "None of my books have my names on the top because I won't let them."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "They would like very much to put my name on the top of the book, but the idea has to be bigger than me."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "I'm not bigger than the idea."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Do you think ego?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "But I also am aware that I've become recognized as the messenger."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "And even though I still think the message is bigger than me, I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And whether I like it or not is irrelevant."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I accept the responsibility, I'm happy to do it."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "I'm not sure how to phrase this, but there's a large part of the culture right now that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with, which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation, meditation, vacation, are really important."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And there's no, it's like, you can't really argue against that."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "In fact, people."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Less sleep."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Just, I'm joking."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Yes, well, that's the thing."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "I often speak to the fact that passion and love for what you're doing and the two words hard work, especially in the engineering fields, are more important than, are more important to prioritize than sleep."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Even though sleep is really important, your mind should be obsessed with the hard work, with the passion, and so on."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And then I get some pushback, of course, from people."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "What do you make sense of that?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer, really pushing hard work?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "I think that that's a short term strategy."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "I think if you sacrifice your health for the work, at some point, it catches up with you."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And at some point, it's like going, going, going, and you get sick."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Your body will shut down for you if you refuse to take care of yourself."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "You get sick."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It's what happens."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Sometimes, more severe illness than something that just slows you down."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So I think taking, getting sleep, I mean, there have been studies on this that, executives, for example, who get a full night's sleep and stop at a reasonable hour, actually accomplish more, are more productive than people who work and burn the midnight oil because their brains are working better because they're well rested."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "So, you know, working hard, yes, but why not work smart?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest makes us more efficient."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I think just driving, driving, driving, driving is a short term, it's a short term strategy."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So, but to push back on that a little bit, the annoying thing is you're like 100% right in terms of science, right?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "But the thing is, because you're 100% right, that weak part of your mind uses that fact to convince you, like what, so, you know, I get all kinds of, my mind comes up with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so what I have a sense, I think what you said about executives and leaders is absolutely right, but there's the early days."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "The early days of madness and passion."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Then I feel like emphasizing sleep, thinking about sleep is giving yourself a way out from the fact that those early days, especially, can be suffering."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "As long, it's not sustainable."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "You know, it's not sustainable."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "Sure, if you're investing all that energy in something at the beginning to get it up and running, then at some point you're gonna have to slow down."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Or your body will slow you down for you."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "Like, you can choose or your body can choose."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So, okay, so you don't think, from my perspective, it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "But you're saying, no."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "I think that there seems evidence that working harder and later have taken a back seat."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "I've taken a back seat."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "I think we have to be careful with broad generalizations."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "But I think if you go into the workplace, there are people who would complain that more people now than before, you know, look at their watches and say, oops, five o clock, goodbye."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Now, is that a problem with the people?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "You're saying it's the people giving themselves excuses and people who don't work hard."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Or is it the organizations aren't giving them something to believe in, something to be passionate about?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "We can't manufacture passion."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "You can't just tell someone, be passionate."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "You know, that's not how it works."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Passion's an output, not an input."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Like if I believe in something and I wanna contribute all that energy to do it, we call that passion."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "You know, working hard for something we love is passion."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Working hard for something we don't care about is called stress."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "But we're working hard either way."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So I think the organizations bear some accountability and our leaders bear some accountability, which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose, if they're not offering us a sense of cause, if they're not telling us that our work is worth more than simply the money it makes, then yeah, I'm gonna come at five o clock because I don't really care about making you money."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "Remember, we live in a world right now where a lot of people, rather a few people, are getting rich on the hard work of others."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And so I think when people look up and say, well, why would I do that?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I'll just, if you're not gonna look after me and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year because you missed your arbitrary projections, you know, you're gonna lay me off because you missed your arbitrary projections, then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?"}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So I think, I don't think we can immediately blame people for going soft."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "I think we can blame leaders for their inability or failure to offer their people something bigger than making a product or making money."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Yeah, so that's brilliant."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And start with why, leaders eat less, your books."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "You basically talk about what it takes to be a good leader."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And so some of the blame should go on the leader, but how much of it is on finding your passion?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "How much is it on the individual?"}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And allowing yourself to pursue that passion, pushing yourself to your limits, to really take concrete steps along your path towards that passion."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Yeah, there's mutual responsibility."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "There's mutual accountability."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "I mean, we're responsible as individuals to find the organizations and find the leaders that inspire us."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And organizations are responsible for maintaining that flame and giving people who believe what they believed, you know, a chance to contribute."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Sort of to linger on it, have you by chance seen the movie Whiplash?"}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Again, maybe I'm romanticizing suffering."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "It's the Russian in you."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "It's the Russian."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "The Russians love suffering."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "But for people who haven't seen, the movie Whiplash has a drum instructor that pushes the drum musician to his limits to bring out the best in him."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And there's a toxic nature to it."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "There's suffering in it."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Like you've worked with a lot of great leaders, a lot of great individuals."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So is that toxic relationship as toxic as it appears in the movie?"}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Or is that fundamental?"}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I've seen that relationship, especially in the past with Olympic athletes, especially in athletics, extreme performers seem to do wonders."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "It does wonders for me."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "There's some of my best relationships, now I'm not representative of everyone certainly, but some of my best relationships for mentee and mentor have been toxic from an external perspective."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "What do you make of that movie?"}, {"time": 1497, "text": "What do you make of that kind of relationship?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "That's not my favorite movie."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Okay, so you don't think that's a healthy, you don't think that kind of relationship is a great example of a great leader?"}, {"time": 1511, "text": "No, I think it's a short term strategy."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "I mean, short term."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "I mean, look, being hard on someone is not the same as toxicity."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "If you go to the Marine Corps, a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And then, but still, even on the last day of bootcamp, they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "But of all the drill instructors, you know, the three or four main drill instructors assigned to a group of recruits, the one that they all want the respect of is the one that's the hardest on them."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And you hear, you know, there's plenty of stories of people who want to earn the respect of a hard parent or a hard teacher."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "But fundamental, that parent, that teacher, that drill instructor has to believe in that person, has to see potential in them."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "It's not a formula, which is if I'm hard on people, they'll do well, which is there has to still be love."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "It has to be done with absolute love."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "And it has to be done responsibly."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "I mean, some people can take a little more pressure than others, but it's not, I think it's irresponsible to think of it as a formula that if I'm just toxic at people, they will do well."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "It depends on their personalities."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "First of all, it works for some, but not all."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And second of all, it can't be done willy nilly."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "It has to still be done with care and love."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And sometimes you can get equal or better results without all of the toxicity."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So one of the, I guess toxicity on my part was a really bad word to use, but if we talk about what makes a good leader and just look at an example in particular, looking at Elon Musk, he's known to push people to their limits in a way that I think really challenges people in a way they've never been challenged before to do the impossible."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "But it can really break people."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And jobs was hard and Amazon is hard."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But the thing that's important is none of them lie about it."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "People ask me about Amazon all the time."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Like Jeff Bezos never lied about it."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "Even the ones who like Amazon don't last more than a couple of years before they burn out."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "But when we're honest about the culture, then it gives people the opportunity who like to work in that kind of culture to choose to work in that kind of culture, as opposed to pretending and saying, oh no, this is all, it's all lovey lovey here."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And then you show up and it's the furthest thing from it."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So, I mean, I think the reputations of putting a lot of pressure on people to, jobs was not an easy man to work for."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "He pushed people, but everyone who worked there was given the space to create and do things that they would not have been able to do anywhere else and work at a level that they didn't work
