port Unix to it, but I picked the wrong processor."}, {"time": 326, "text": "I picked the National Semiconductor NS16032, which was this amazing, you know, CISC, complex instruction set computer, and not the reduced instruction set computers that were just being contemplated into the mid eighties."}, {"time": 343, "text": "And RISC ultimately went out."}, {"time": 345, "text": "RISC won in some ways, it dissolved into, you have both now, you have these super scalar architectures where like Intel has kept probably too much backward compatibility at the instruction level, but that's just, there's a front end that parses that into these, you know, these wide internal instructions."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So, you know, the very long instruction word research that was also interesting at the time kind of became the micro architecture inside the backward compatible Intel."}, {"time": 371, "text": "But I picked a National Semi chip and it never got made successfully."}, {"time": 374, "text": "It was full of bugs and I never could have brought it up."}, {"time": 377, "text": "But I went on out of physics after three years into math, computer science."}, {"time": 383, "text": "And like I said, I did it because I saw, I was being sort of childlike and naive about physics."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And I thought, meanwhile, the Valley is go go for computers."}, {"time": 392, "text": "The Apple II, right?"}, {"time": 393, "text": "The PC, the Intel 8086, 8088 based PC, the IBM, you know, gave Microsoft the future for, you know, somewhat fishy deal."}, {"time": 406, "text": "So it was wide open in the computing space, but in physics, you were as optimistic about physics as?"}, {"time": 412, "text": "No, I mean, I was one of three brothers who were all in the same grade."}, {"time": 416, "text": "I have a twin and a younger brother who skipped second grade and was with us the whole time after that."}, {"time": 422, "text": "And, you know, he went on, he actually studied under Kip Thorne at Caltech."}, {"time": 427, "text": "But he also didn't, he ended up in software."}, {"time": 429, "text": "He didn't talk about physics stuff."}, {"time": 432, "text": "Does it make you sad that theoretical physics, even with string theory, hasn't really had any foundational breakthroughs in the latter part of the 20th century?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "Yeah, in fact, I'd say the problem is theory over experiment."}, {"time": 447, "text": "I would say, you know, we need more Aristotle and less Plato."}, {"time": 451, "text": "You know, mathematics is not all physical."}, {"time": 453, "text": "There are lots of mathematics that cannot be realized as far as I know in this world."}, {"time": 458, "text": "So to understand the world, you need to do experiments."}, {"time": 461, "text": "You need to not just dream up inductive theories that could have lots of alternative theories competing with them, with no way to decide between them, except aesthetics, which is not a good guide in my opinion."}, {"time": 473, "text": "Yeah, I don't know if you are friends or have a relationship with Elon Musk."}, {"time": 476, "text": "Where's the, in terms of like what you would love to see our society investing in, building up, is it closer to Elon or is it closer to Feynman and Einstein and those?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "Well, those gentlemen are no longer with us and I think that's noticed."}, {"time": 492, "text": "So like I said, the real glory days of physics, the famous pictures from Germany before the second war were just a fantastic assembly of brains, Schrodinger and Einstein."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And physics, I think, took a wrong turn that maybe all of, I would say, Western science took in going for models over reality, right?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "You see this in all sorts of fields."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Now, we can build models that are very predictive and generative and then we build actual devices or semiconductors, things like that."}, {"time": 522, "text": "That's good, I'm not dismissing that."}, {"time": 524, "text": "We need good models, we need to experiment and prove them and test them."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But the problem I've seen in physics, which you see certainly in economics, the dismal science, and you see surprisingly in other so called hard sciences is models that don't really have to be tested against reality."}, {"time": 545, "text": "They can instead become policy tools or they can become, like I said, one of a large family of alternate theories that could be as predictive but nobody's doing the winnowing out."}, {"time": 557, "text": "That's such an interesting tension in society."}, {"time": 558, "text": "You see this in even the software scientists which have a deep love for psychology."}, {"time": 564, "text": "You see this in epidemiology, not with the virus."}, {"time": 568, "text": "There's this tension of how much of the world can we understand through just a beautifully fit model?"}, {"time": 575, "text": "And then at the same time, my main work is in machine learning where it's like there is no provable thing usually."}, {"time": 584, "text": "It's all about just getting the right data set and getting tricks and so on."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And there's this tension even in my own soul of I grew up on theoretical computer science."}, {"time": 595, "text": "I loved approximation algorithms, all of that different complexity classes, just those little puzzles."}, {"time": 603, "text": "I mean, I don't know, to you as somebody who was in math and computer science and then ended up going into places where you engineer some of the most impactful things in this world, do you see the P versus NP, all that whole space is interesting at all?"}, {"time": 621, "text": "Yeah, it's not that useful in practice."}, {"time": 624, "text": "People are using it with sort of crypto analysis or asymptotic arguments about can we have a quantum resistant crypto algorithm, things like that, which may not be practical, right?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "If you follow Mikhail Diakonov or Gil Kalai, there are big questions about how quantum computing will scale up, how practical it will be."}, {"time": 646, "text": "Is that something that you think about quantum computing?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "Not except for spare time."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Like you said, I'm not using this kind of computer science in practice because almost everything now is engineering and finding ways to get computers to be more useful for people, which goes from design problems, which are really kind of an art."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Like you said, anything you can't automate is an art."}, {"time": 669, "text": "Well, we can have machine learning compose music and it can imitate, you can train it, and it can sound kind of decent, but maybe lacking that je ne sais quoi."}, {"time": 678, "text": "But user interface still, I think, requires human art."}, {"time": 683, "text": "So speaking of things that didn't follow a perfect theory and model, JavaScript, so there's two things."}, {"time": 691, "text": "One, it had an impact on the world at a huge scale, obviously, and it also still is one of probably the most popular programming language in the world."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So can we go back to the origin story?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "Can you tell the story of how JavaScript was created?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "Yeah, I was at Silicon Graphics after graduate school for seven years, and it got to be big and successful and divisionalized and political, and I thought kind of boring."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And a friend who'd been there went to one of the last of the super companies, the super startups in the early 90s."}, {"time": 727, "text": "There were several."}, {"time": 728, "text": "I suppose General Magic was a little after that around the same time."}, {"time": 731, "text": "But Micro Unity was that company that I went to, and it was because my friend Jeff Weinstein had gone there from Silicon Graphics."}, {"time": 738, "text": "He recruited me, and Micro Unity was doing everything."}, {"time": 741, "text": "So this was like the ultimate sort of pretend grad school."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It was doing a new fab, new semiconductor process."}, {"time": 749, "text": "It was doing new analog and digital circuits on the same very large but not wafer scale chip."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Originally, it was five centimeters on a side."}, {"time": 760, "text": "It was really hot too, so I needed a water cooler."}, {"time": 763, "text": "It was a Craykiller, and then they shrunk it, and they tried to do a home sort of media processor that was essentially a barrel processor."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So if you could have software gradable set top boxes, the cable companies thought they could save a lot of money and add features."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Is this assembly, or which level of the software?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "It was like, we were writing in, we were using GCC."}, {"time": 813, "text": "We were writing C++ and C. Somebody I worked with there, really very smart guy, hired from a sort of Wall Street hotshot programming consultancy, did his own hardware design as well as software."}, {"time": 827, "text": "And we were working on how to make not only a short vector units, but general bit shufflers and permuters."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So you could do things like crypto algorithms efficiently, and you could do demodulation of the cable, complex quadrature amplitude modulated signal."}, {"time": 845, "text": "So you're basically taking A to D converters, dumping things in buffers, and then doing the rest in software."}, {"time": 850, "text": "All the framing and the Reed Solomon and Viterbi and all that error correction."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So that was really great learning experience, but it was not gonna work."}, {"time": 856, "text": "It was doing too many risky things at once, right?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "If you, as Jim Clark said to me, when I hopped to Netscape after three years at MicroUnity, he said, oh yeah, you do 10 things each, one in 10 odds, it's gonna be one in 10 billion, right?"}, {"time": 869, "text": "The multiplication principle."}, {"time": 871, "text": "So, Netscape was already a rocket, and I passed the chance to go there in 1994."}, {"time": 876, "text": "I knew the founders because I worked at SGI, Clark's company."}, {"time": 880, "text": "Could you pause for a second in Netscape?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "When was the launch of this rocket?"}, {"time": 884, "text": "94."}, {"time": 885, "text": "94 was the launch of Netscape?"}, {"time": 887, "text": "And I went there in early 95 in April."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Okay, so you said you missed the launch."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Well, I missed the first floor employment opportunity, but the IPO was August 1995, so I was there for that."}, {"time": 898, "text": "How obvious was it that Netscape was like world changing?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "What was the layout?"}, {"time": 904, "text": "Was Netscape one of the first big browsers?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Yes, so when I was at MicroUnity still in 93, we saw a browser called Mosaic."}, {"time": 911, "text": "And up till then, we'd used email and we'd used Usenet, the NNTP protocol, we'd use news readers, we used FTP, we used all these old internet protocols, all relying on the DNS and TCP IP and UDP for that matter."}, {"time": 925, "text": "When I was at Silicon Graphics, we brought up the whole stack, right?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "We had to discover how to find the ethernet addresses on your network and then find IP addresses for them, ARP protocol, all that stuff."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And it was great because nobody knew in the 80s what was gonna win, all the proprietary stacks like IBM, SNA and DeckNet and all these other protocols were saying, we're gonna do it or it's gonna be heterogeneous future."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And instead it was Berkeley Unix and the TCP IP stack that dated back to the ARPANET that won."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And I think we knew it, we all knew it at SGI, but the salespeople didn't."}, {"time": 959, "text": "And so they kept trying to get multiple network stacks interoperating, but in the end it won."}, {"time": 964, "text": "And so that was the internet and it was email and texty and it was used and very texty."}, {"time": 969, "text": "And then Tim Berners Lee did his thing, but I don't think I was paying attention."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And I think the date when he first did it or when he wrote the famous emails and pushed back to 89, but I noticed a mosaic in 93 because one of the things that Mark Andreessen and Eric Bina did at NCSA was they innovated on the early HTML standard."}, {"time": 991, "text": "They in particular Mark sent this email saying, hey everybody, we think you should be able to put an image in a page."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And you know when he sent that Eric Bina had already written the code."}, {"time": 999, "text": "And I talked to Tim Berners Lee more recently just a few years ago and he was like, oh, we had another way of doing it and it didn't work out because Mark shipped his in mosaic."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "And this convinced me of several things."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "One, the internet meant there was a huge first mover advantage and being fast, getting on first mattered a lot."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And so Richard Gabriel of scheme and poetry fame has written about this, the famous."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "What's poetry?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Well, he's a poet."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Oh, actual poetry."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Is he talking about some kind of something?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "I mean, he's the founder of Lucid, which is where Jamie Zawinski worked before Netscape."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And Lucid was doing compilers and Lucid Emacs, which was a fork of Emacs, famously Jamie fighting against Richard Stallman, Stalmax."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "And so Richard Gabriel, very, very brainy computer guy, but also a poet, but he wrote a nice essay that gets abused all the time."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "In fact, Jamie's put a kind of warning in front of his version of it on his site, JWC.org called Worse is Better."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And this is about survival advantage of software in the network world, in my opinion."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "It's about Unix."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "It started out being framed as Unix and Lisp, good news, bad news, because all the Lisp people, the MIT people were like, oh, you know, the crown jewel scheme, this Faberge egg or Common Lisp, this giant cathedral, of course we're going to win."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "This is civilization."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And those, you know, those farmers in New Jersey to borrow from the Sopranos, those picks down at Bell Labs, they're just, you know, there's nothing sound there."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "It's all hacking."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Well, guess what won?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Wow, so you're saying this is a fundamental, like principle of the internet is moving fast wins."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "You could say in almost any network system, like in biological evolution, you see successful alleles sweep populations and they don't always have, you know, they aren't free of flaws."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "They're heterozygous advantage, right?"}, {"time": 1106, "text": "You can get both parents give you the gene variant and you get sickle cell anemia, right?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "But if one of them does, you're more resistant to malaria."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And so this isn't a beautiful process, except at large scale."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And then you realize that because it moves fast and can adapt, it can win."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And people still struggle with this."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "I used to struggle with this because JavaScript was done in such a hurry and the force of web compatibility meant early mistakes couldn't be fixed."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And even the standards process injected new mistakes, as it will."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "But often standards bodies go back and making compatible changes."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "You can't do that with the web."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "It's more like, again, like biology, you preserve what still works."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "You don't want to break ATP metabolism or whatever."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So you have to kind of resign yourself to the reality of worse is better being enshrined in actual design points you might not like."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And that happened with JavaScript and I'm way over it, but it also, I think was a huge advantage."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "That's why JavaScript has kind of swept a lot of programming domains."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "People will say, oh, it's not because of merit."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Well, you're right."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "But we also improved it over time in the standards body."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "I spent 20 years doing that."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "And you don't get that choice."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "It's like, I'm not saying that that was the best language."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "I'm just saying that was the right time to do it."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And I like to say the alternative was not to do it."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "I could have told Netscape, I can't do this."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "It's too rushed."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And it would have been visual basic script."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And it would have been bad."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So that's a good way to present the alternative."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But so it was a Netscape and you have written it in how many days and why was it only that many days?"}, {"time": 1205, "text": "And what was the goal and the underlying principles in your mind at the time?"}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So the whole, I'm sort of describing worse is better in a frenetic way because it fit the model of Netscape."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "When it was known that Jim Clark and Marc Inves were founding Netscape and they did the first release in 1994, that browser took over from Mosaic."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "In fact, that's why Mozilla is called that."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "It's the Mosaic killer."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It's like the giant monster that kills Mosaic."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "And they knew they could, it wasn't that, again, it's not like you're doing advanced scientific research that is changing the world."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "You're more like taking down the last iteration on the browser, Marc did, which had images and other importances before he stopped working on it."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And you're making Netscape the new thing that has images, plugins, which was the way to do video back in the day."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "It had something that's kind of died now for tiled windows called frames and frame sets."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "HTML tables, that was new."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Eric Bina did tables in Netscape 1.1."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So when I got there, they were heading toward IPO."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Clark wanted the IPO early, I think his instinct was right."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "And that kicked off the whole dot com era, right?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "There was a recession in the US in 91."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "You can see old law and order reruns where they talk about the recession and how hard it's hitting New Yorkers."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And after that, Greenspan really goosed things at the Federal Reserve and technology had been sort of fermenting in a way that came together with the internet."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And Netscape made it possible to do pets.com, to do eBay, to get people to recognize a URL on a billboard and then type it in when they get home."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And that was huge."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "That was so fast moving a rocket that Marc and the engineering team there thought, we need to make this a programmable browser, not just a document viewer, not just a video."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "It was all HTML with images and tables and also, like you said, frames."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "There was no dynamic element at all."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "Yeah, the most dynamism we get was from a plugin, which there are a few of them then."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Flash didn't exist at that point."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "It was, I think."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Java Applets yet or no?"}, {"time": 1327, "text": "Well, that's the thing we did to deal with Sun."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "In fact, I was recruited to go do Scheme in the browser."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "Remember Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman's beautiful Lisp variant?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "I was gonna do it in the browser because my friends from SG, I thought, hey, we like Scheme, you like Scheme."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And I'm like, I hardly ever use Scheme."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "It's not really used in industry, except in sort of silos, but I like it."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Okay, I'll come do Scheme in the browser."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "I have a slide from my 2017 talk where I have Bruce Willis crawling through the duct in Die Hard."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "He's like, come out to the coast, have a lot of fun."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "Come on, do Scheme in the browser."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But when I got there, there was no Scheme in the browser because they'd started a deal with Sun Microsystems."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And my best contact there was Bill Joy, who I admired as a Berkeley Unix founder."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And, you know, Sun founder."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And Bill got the idea of making the browser programmable too."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And so the main idea was to put the Java VM, which at that point was not really easy to embed, into Netscape, including the Netscape version on Windows that was still most popular, which was the 16 bit Windows 3.1, which was going away."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Microsoft was coming out with Windows 95 and everyone was afraid they were gonna do Internet Explorer, I guess, two at that point, three the next year."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "They already bought or invested in somehow Spyglass, this other company that shot out from NCSA at University of Illinois."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And in fact, Microsoft had tried to buy Netscape in late 94, before I got there."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And I heard about this later."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I heard they offered way too little money."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And so, you know, Jim Barksdale and Jim Clark said, get out of here, you know, pound sand."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "But then they realized, oh, this is going to hurt us because now they're gonna copy us."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Didn't happen right away."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "I'm not sure when Gates internet title wave memo was written."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "That's the famous memo he wrote when Bill Gates realized that Microsoft was going down this old copy AOL path or copy CompuServe path, a project called Blackbird, presumably after the SR71, I don't know."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "But they were gonna make a, you know, dial up service with a custom content language stack and custom rendering."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "It wasn't the web."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "You know, they could have content partners."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "They have a lot of money, but it still wasn't to scale the web."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "It wasn't gonna be compelling."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And Gates realized this, and he turned the company on a dime and they couldn't buy Netscape."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Again, I'm not sure the timing, so they decided to copy it."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "And once we realized that everybody inside Netscape felt even more urgency and more of a frenetic mood."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And so my chance to do scheme disappeared when the Java deal started brewing."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "But there was still a chance to do a companion language to Java because Java was a compiled, is a compiled language."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It's evolved and improved quite a lot since then too, but it was for sort of serious advanced programmers that cost a certain salary or hourly rate."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And people observed, Bill Joy observed, and Mark Andreessen and I observed that in a mature stack like Microsoft, you really benefit from having a scripting language like Visual Basic, which became Visual Basic script in IE3, but didn't take over and kill JavaScript, that you need two languages."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "One is for the component writers who are higher price and more expert."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And the other is for scripters, certified public accountants, designers, graphic designers with some programming inclination, anybody, amateurs, doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "There's a much more demotic approach there for programming the components together, gluing them together."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Some people say duct tape language, which I don't really like."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "But we saw, Bill Joy and Mark Andreessen and I, we saw the need for a companion language."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And the gleam in our eye was to call it JavaScript."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "I didn't like it, that was marketing's plan."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Mark called it Mocha, which I liked."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And Netscape Marketing, I think, didn't like that."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So they said, oh, there's some trademark and some software somewhere that uses Mocha, so we can't use that."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And they tried LiveScript in August and that didn't

to glue things together between Java and JavaScript."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So you're going to have commerce in memory, in the heap with data types."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So you're going to

fork threads and go to town."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "But the main action in the browser was in the single threaded program, the single Unix process on Unix or Windows."}, {"time": 1791, "text":

driven programming was in part like HyperCard because HyperCard had this on event name syntax."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so that's why you have in JavaScript on click run together as the name of the event handler."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And there's some funny ones on mouse over and on mouse out, people still complain about those."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "But there were many more events now over the years standardized, but it was a mix of event driven single threaded programming because it had to run in the main thread of the browser where the action is and Java never got there."},

till then, Microsoft had been using Java components like in Outlook Web Access, which had a lot of JavaScript to be a webmail like Hotmail, like user interface."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "They had to call the mail server through HTTP and they used a Java object to do this."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "And when they gave the boot to Sun, suddenly the left hand gave the boot and the right hand said, we better do something else in Outlook Web Access."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "What are we gonna do?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "And they said, let's just add an ActiveX component, which is their own

you can."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "Making it sloppy."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "So what is the biggest thing you regret in those 10 days?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And what is the biggest thing

you please make it sloppy or add this cute feature?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "The answer should be no."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And I should have known that because I think Nicholas Viert, one of my heroes said, the essence of design is leaving things out."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "But during the 10 days, I also, like I said, I was in such a hurry, I left out garbage collection, came back to

sent some people who were pretty good."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "And then when they realized that I was there and Netscape was not gonna just bend over and do whatever they wanted, they sent somebody really good."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "And he was a smart guy."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "Sean Katzenberger, he's

this."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "Cause it took a lot of focused work to create the first draft of the spec."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "And I was still holding, I was spending almost all the plates."},

take as much time as Sean was to write the draft spec, but I had to participate because I was essentially helping write down what the language did and in areas where we didn't like what it did and

the time, Jan van der Bell, was quite a raconteur and a very fun guy."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And he had us out for, you know, the great, you know, Fui de mer, the bouillabaisse and the...

Katzenberger, Microsoft, was actually mad."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "We need him."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "And when I got there, I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug in somewhere in the spec."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And then I saw it too."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And I said, there's a fence post bug there."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "And then we kind of locked eyes and we realized we were on the same page."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "And we kind of, he wasn't mad anymore."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "What were the features that are being struggled over and debated and thought about?"}, {"time": 3575, "text": "It was mainly writing down what worked and what we thought should work in the edge cases that didn't interoperate or that seemed wrong."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "But we were already laying the groundwork for the future additions that I was already implementing."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "I was still trying to lead the standard by using the dominant market power to write the code that actually shipped."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "So the de facto standard would lead the de jure standard."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "And I was putting in the missing function forms that I didn't have time for in the 10 days."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "So you didn't want to create the perfect language, but one that was the popular and shipped and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "And you could say there was, I was standing on the shoulders of giants."},

days."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "So they came in 1996 and 97, and they came into the third edition of the standard, which was final finalized in 1999."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "But at that point,

a famous investor."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "He did very well on Google."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "So he's a billionaire, Ramshree Ram, and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape."}, {"time":

browser."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "So there is some bullying going on."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "It was totally immaterial in the antitrust case."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "But JavaScript escaped into the standard setting where there was fairly good cooperation."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Microsoft had a really good guy on it and Guy Steele was there for a time and there was some good work."},

3760, "text": "But ES6, it's become this like reputable, like it fixed major pain points, I think."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "It added things to the language and added something that was already ES5 strict mode, but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "It was a big jump, but it accumulated some of the ES4 designs that we'd done with Adobe for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript that were supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript 2 ideas that had come into ActionScript 3."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "So you look at the family tree and you see these forks and the main ones are the ones that go into Adobe Flash acquired from Macromedia and the one that went into the service side of Microsoft's stack, which kind of died."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "And then trying to bring them back into the standard and not quite succeeding, ES4 was mothballed, but all the good parts that everyone liked made it into ES6."},

the standards body and guess how their version of modules or decorators should work."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "And the standards body then may change things a bit."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So I think they're obligated with TypeScript either to carry their own version or to bring it back with incompatible changes towards the standard over time."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "And I think they've

kind of dance partner to JavaScript, to the base JavaScript?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "There's a hope that at some point, if they keep reconverging it and the standard doesn't break them and goes in a good direction, we will get at least the annotation syntax and some semantics around them."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "Because when you're talking about type annotations, they're generally on

casts that occur in dominator positions in the control flow graph."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "So it's like a hack on JavaScript and it's a subset and it uses those bitwise operators that I talked about copying from Java to basically cast numeric types, which are double position flowing point, into integers."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And so inside JavaScript, in the kernel semantics, are integers."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "And if you use these operators, if a compiler emits them in the right places, you can then treat them as typed values, typed memory locations, and you can type

days they had Unreal Engine ported by pressing a compile button."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "But they had to have WebGL, which came from OpenGL."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "Yes, it came to OpenGL, which came from Silicon Graphics GL."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "They had to have Web Audio so they could map OpenAL, which was another audio library standard to Web Audio, which was kind of a Chrome idiosyncratic thing."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "But they could make it work."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "And they had to have Asm.js for fast C++ to JavaScript."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "And if you

about it."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "Because we demoed it at GDC, Game Developer Conference 2013."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "And people were stunned."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "That's like Unreal Engine, Unreal Tournament running in my browser window."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "No plugin, no Flash, no Java, no."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "So were those the early days of, because JavaScript now is able to run basically on par with a lot of the C++."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "And even before then, you had the fast JavaScript VMs in 2008 when Chrome came out."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "Just before it came out, Mozilla, my friend Andreas Gal and I and others hacked out Trace Monkey, our Trace based JIT."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "The Squirrel Fish Extreme team at Apple did their JIT."},

JavaScript started getting fast and developers started noticing it."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "But it was still kind of its own high level language with garbage collection."}, {"time": 4650, "text":

code that Google had acquired, native client."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "Which is a separate lineage for taking basically C code, compiling it into a software fault isolated container of some sort using some kind of virtualization technique."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "And maybe it can even be in process and still be memory safe, that would be awesome."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "But they ended up using process isolation too."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "And that kind of weakened it."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And in the end, it was like portable native client, okay, meet the new boss, same as the old boss."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "This is the Google Flash, right?"}, {"time": 4693, "text": "But when we did Asm.js and we showed Unreal Engine working, I think it was only a matter of time before Google threw in the towel."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And in fact, everybody agreed in spring of 2015, we're gonna take what was proven by Asm.js and make a new syntax, a binary syntax, it's efficient, that loads into the same JavaScript VM that JavaScript loads into."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "So there'll be two source languages, one VM, very important, one garbage collector, one memory manager, one set of compiler stages."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "And that's called WebAssembly."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "And that's the successor to Asm.js."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "And it's important that it have binary syntax because at the end of the day, especially on mobile, if you're downloading JavaScript, even if you're using LZ compression on the wire, that's cool, but you've got to blow it out into memory and then parse the silly eight character function keyword that I picked, when I should have used something shorter, I picked it because of awk, the Unix tool."}, {"time":

of Fortuna."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And in the, it's about the 97, I was loaned by Netscape to do due diligence for Sun in their acquisition of Anamorphic, which was David Unger and friends,

fundamentally dynamic."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "You don't declare the types."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "But you could infer the types as the program runs and you start to form these ideas about what

Firebird."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "And then this Australian centered open source database project started really like in the true Mad Max style, just screaming at us saying, you can't use Firebird."}, {"time": 6328, "text": "And I had to sort of be the ambassador and say, okay, we're gonna rename."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "And they're like, we don't believe you, you shouldn't have used it, we hate you."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "And then we renamed it to Firefox."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And they're like, ah, we love you."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "And then I haven't heard of them ever since."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "But Firefox was a clever name."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "We had to think of something distinctive."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "We wanted to keep the fire going."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "And it turns out there's a red panda, right?"}, {"time": 6348, "text": "That's the nickname for it."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "So that's the second set of browser wars."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "So how was Firefox born, how was Mozilla born?"}, {"time": 6359, "text": "There's a long story there too."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "So Netscape got acquired by AOL, which as I say was a reasonable happy ending for a lot of people, because Netscape otherwise was gonna go out of business because Microsoft was just killing its market."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "There was no way to charge for a browser."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "Windows came with IE, IE4 was pretty good and Netscape 4 wasn't that good."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "It took a while to get better."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "But the Netscape executive said, let's do an open source escape pod."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "And like in Star Wars, A New Hope, the gunner won't shoot it because there's no life forms on board, right?"}, {"time": 6390, "text": "It's not a threat."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And so we did Mozilla in 1998 and it looked like it was going to initially just give the world an open source browser."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "But it's really hard to get people to work on this sort of hairball that had been hacked up over by that point four years."}, {"time": 6406, "text": "And it also couldn't have the crypto module for secure sockets, so called, or now transport layer security."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "That was an electronic munition."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "We were not allowed to release that in the full 1024 bit key strength."}, {"time": 6420, "text": "And yet people, one of whom I happened to meet previously at SGI when I went on a sales support engineering trip, Tim Hudson in Brisbane, Australia, and Eric A."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "Young did what became open SSL."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "It was called SSL EAY after Eric's initials."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "And Tim and Eric took their open SSL outside of the purview of the NSA and the Department of Commerce, and they stuck it into Mozilla's code."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "And that was perhaps the best hack that was done in the first few months after we open sourced the browser."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "We had other problems."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "The politics inside Netscape were riven by these acquisitions."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "So the one acquisition that kind of messed up Netscape for also wanted to keep doing a proprietary mail and groupware program, not Jamie Zawinski's mail program that was in Netscape two and three."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "And they held it back from open source."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "We didn't have a mail program, it was just a browser."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "We didn't know what AOL will do to us."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "Turns out they didn't interfere with us for a long time."}, {"time": 6479, "text": "But Netscape wasn't the best steward of Mozilla."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "We were operating Mozilla as a pirate ship without a legal entity."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "So most of us worked for Netscape under a separate organization."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "And initially the first engineering manager, Tom Paquin of Netscape was the Mozilla founding manager."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "But he left pretty quickly and he left me as the acting manager, which is more like method acting in my case."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "And that was my first management stint."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "But then someone who'd written the licenses, Mitchell Baker, she was a lawyer at Netscape."}, {"time": 6514, "text": "She was involved in the open source license decision making and the actual writing and construction of those licenses."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "That was Mitchell's job, Netscape public license and the truly open Mozilla public license."}, {"time": 6525, "text": "And there were two because Netscape needed, because of some encumbered code, needed some special rights but that went away over time."}, {"time": 6531, "text": "Mitchell was always interested in Mozilla and she came back from maternity leave and she said, I'll be the manager if you want."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "And Jamie and I said, sure."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "And then Jamie quit, he quit after a year."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "He said, this didn't work, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "He acted like it was a total failure because Mozilla didn't restart the browser market."}, {"time": 6548, "text": "But there's no way it could have, right?"}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Netscape was still shipping variants of Netscape 4, which was based on the old code."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "Mozilla was trying to react to the code to make greenfield for developers."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "So it was one of my big goals."}, {"time": 6560, "text": "It wasn't a technical goal so much as again, a social goal."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "People wanted a more standard spaced browser."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "They wanted less of a hairball that had been hacked on by ex grad students starting four years prior."}, {"time": 6572, "text": "So we said, we're gonna make a modular code base."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "We're gonna use a variant or an open source version of Microsoft's component object model, has reference counting and standardized V tables, virtual calls and C++."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "And we're gonna use JavaScript."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "We're gonna have a bridge between those two so you can script those components just like Java components."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "We're going to make a portable front end with a markup language for the user interface."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "Not tables, not HTML, but custom menus and dropdowns and toolbars."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "And that was called Zool, XML user interface language."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "And some real talent on the Netscape side delivered that."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Dave Hyatt, who was instrumental in Zool, Chris Watterson, Joe Hewitt, Blake Ross."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "And Blake was an intern."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "He was like a high school aged intern at Netscape."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "And at some point we were innovating rapidly in the Mozilla world and Netscape was still caught up in this management mess from these acquisitions and it wasn't delivering."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "And every year they were wondering if ALO was gonna come and start beheading the executives because it didn't do anything useful."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "And there was this thought you should take the Netscape browser engine and put it in the Windows ALO client, which was the dial up client that all the increasingly aging users of ALO were using."}, {"time": 6645, "text": "Never happened."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "It would have been too big a change."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "So it wasn't clear why ALO bought Netscape, but as I said, they left it alone."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "But Netscape didn't leave Mozilla alone."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "And so in 2001, Mitchell called me up and said, I'm no longer employed."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "And I was like, what?"}, {"time": 6660, "text": "You quit?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "No, no, this wasn't my choice."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "And there was a layoff which maybe accidentally or on purpose got rid of Mitchell."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "But the funny thing was we had an open source project."}, {"time": 6668, "text": "We had a lot of the engineers on staff on our side and we had people we'd hired through the Mozilla community who were top notch."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "They'd risen, they came in high quality, they knew the code and they actually were better than the average or median hire of Netscape."}, {"time": 6683, "text": "And so the funny thing was the executive who thought they'd gotten rid of Mitchell in the layoff on the next week's community call around Mozilla and what to do, there's Mitchell."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "And so this showed you can kind of transcend your boundaries of corporate open source if you get a project that has enough loyalty, even among the paid staff."}, {"time": 6703, "text": "Because we had outside people contributing."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "We had people at Red Hat and a few other places, but the majority of the hackers were employed by Netscape."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "But a lot of them at that point had come from the community and others got the community and wanted to work with it."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "And it was really the weakest engineers at Netscape who didn't like Mozilla and didn't like the crucible of competing with the better programmers."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "So if the project is good enough, it will rise, the Phoenix will rise out of the... That's exactly right."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "And so we had this Mozilla code base that was getting better."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "In fact, I think at some point in 2002 when we declared Mozilla 1.0, I engineered a roadmap that successively through similar sort of six week, five week releases, like we all do with browser releases nowadays, Chrome does and Firefox braved us three weeks."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "We got to a point where we said, you know what?"}, {"time": 6749, "text": "It doesn't suck."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "This is like the 1.0 that you want to release because if you hold it back any longer to polish it, you're denying others the ability to use it."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "It's like pro engineer, the mechanical CAD tool embedded the code, they embedded the layout engine."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "And Mozilla 1.0 was like a Netscape communication suite."}, {"time": 6766, "text": "We had at that point gotten male people to reintegrate mail and news and we had an editor for HTML."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And it felt like a 90s suite, suiteware."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "And it felt kind of bloated."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "And the people who were taking that Mozilla open source and then adding Netscape flavor to it were not calling the shots right."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "And they were also under AOL's thumb a little bit and that they said, well, we should probably put the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "We should put the ICQ, the other messaging system that AOL had acquired."}, {"time": 6797, "text": "We should put the ICQ button on the toolbar."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "And pretty soon Netscape looked like a bit of a NASCAR badged version of Mozilla."}, {"time": 6804, "text": "And that also made Mozilla more popular."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "And yet they had contrived to fire or lay off the leader and we carried on with an open source structure where Mozilla was still, you know, Mitchell was calling sort of management or project level shots and I was calling technical shots."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "And we had a popular suite, but we thought, why not make it just a browser?"}, {"time": 6832, "text": "Because it'll be simpler, it'll do one job well."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "And even then we can strip it down by having extensions."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "So Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, the high school aged intern did the first version, which was called Mozilla slash browser."}, {"time": 6847, "text": "It was very, the small group of us, Ian Hicks and Asa Dotzler, me and Joe Hewitt and Hyatt and Blake."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "And Hyatt was really the senior hacker."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "He'd done all these things like amazing cross platform menus through the user interface, markup language."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "And he knew how to do tab browsing."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "He'd implemented it natively on Mac OS at the time in Camino originally called Chimera."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "He'd written multiple implementations, which was a thing programmers should do."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "It's like the V8 team did for those missing years when the rest of the Chrome team's like, where's V8?"}, {"time": 6881, "text": "In fact, Dave's wife, Rebecca told me a story about when they were at UIUC, they were also University of Illinois grad students."}, {"time": 6889, "text": "There was an assignment, it was a programming assignment it was supposed to do at the end of the semester."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "And Dave's friend was this, I'm gonna go think and I'm gonna design and I'm gonna make this platonic perfect form of the program."}, {"time": 6901, "text": "And then I'm gonna write it at the end when it's due."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "And Hyatt just went there and started hacking."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "He wrote one version, he wrote a second version, a third version, end of the semester comes around."}, {"time": 6909, "text": "The friend's not doing too well."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "It wasn't perfect and it wasn't written."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "I'm not sure how that story ended for him, but Dave's version was a fifth iteration, it was great."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "And so he'd done that with everything you need in a tabbed browser."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "And this really showed well in Phoenix, what we called Phoenix and I had to rename two more times."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "And Blake went to Stanford, he became a Stanford student and couldn't work on it."}, {"time": 6934, "text": "Dave Hyatt went to Apple in 2001."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "He was one of the founding Safari team members."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "But he was still blogging about tabbed browsing."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "I think Apple at some point said you should."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "Safari have tabbed browsing?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "Yeah, but it was because of Hyatt."}, {"time": 6948, "text": "Hyatt was quite a feather in their cap."}, {"time": 6949, "text": "Don Melton, who had been the engineering manager for Safari from the beginning, had been in Netscape also."}, {"time": 6956, "text": "And so there's this diaspora of talent and yet Hyatt was still kind of writing blog posts about how to do tabs right."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "And at some point Apple said, don't blog about that."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "That's our proprietary tab technology."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "And I was like, no, it's not."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "It was an opera and I've refined it."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "So we had to replace people and we had Ben Goodger, a New Zealander we hired at Netscape."}, {"time": 6978, "text": "And he stepped in to be the Firefox lead."}, {"time": 6981, "text": "And we also had this weird circumstance where AOL finally did notice that Netscape was kind of an albatross, that they bought it for no particular benefit."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And even then the AOL politics were also heinous, sort of East Coast politics."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "I remember taking two trips there because I was a principal engineer."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "And so us principal engineers got trotted out to do dog and pony shows in Dallas, Virginia."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "And the AOL opera management was very East Coast in flavor."}, {"time": 7006, "text": "And they were at that time merging with Time Warner, which did not go well."}, {"time": 7010, "text": "So one of these years we went out there and

7033, "text": "They were haute bourgeoisie."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "They were funny and they were kind of useless and kind of preppy."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "And then the next year we went back and I said, where's Reggie?"}, {"time": 7042, "text": "And it's like, oh, Reggie's not here anymore because Time Warner realized that the merger wasn't in their interest either."}, {"time": 7047,

these giant companies and they think there's gonna be synergy."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "That was the 90s, late 90s watch word."}, {"time": 7057, "text": "And there wasn't synergy with AOL buying Netscape and there wasn't synergy with Time Warner and AOL."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "But did AOL ever really work?"}, {"time": 7063, "text": "Was it ever really cool?"}, {"time": 7064, "text": "Like the same kind of fire and excitement that Firefox eventually created, was that ever there in AOL?"}, {"time": 7071, "text": "AOL was the right time to do a dial up service that got distribution by basically leaflet bombing compact discs on the country."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "And they beat out CompuServe and the other ones, Prodigy, and then the web happened."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "And so you had almost like this isolated continent, like some of the evolutionary biologists I follow make fun of the funny large marsupial mammals of Australia, how silly they are."}, {"time": 7101,

distribution because Microsoft was doing a search engine, Bing, since 2007."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "In fact, when they came out with Bing, Google was worried that Microsoft would just brute force

updating and it can store an encrypted version of your login credentials with a timestamp so you can stay logged in without having to retype your password every time you navigate, which is how it would be if you didn't have cookies."}, {"time": 7811, "text": "The web protocols, especially in the 90s, are so called stateless protocols."}, {"time": 7816, "text": "So you go to your bank, you log

the last cookie, which could be empty at first, and the response carries the updated cookie."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "So just by having images and cookies, you got tracking because that image server can be serving a little one by one pixel and they still use the word pixel in ad tech."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "And that pixel can be served from the same server, embedded differently with different URL spellings in the New York Times and ESPN."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "And as you go from one to the other, the image server can say, I haven't got a cookie for you."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "It's

thing."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "And the database gets updated and the number user 1234 indexes in the database to a profile of you, you've been tracked."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "This was not

fundamental problem the world is facing now."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "They're looking at what social media has created and they're looking at, and like a world is looking at itself in the mirror and seeing that privacy is actually something as opposed to like a nice thing to have."}, {"time": 7973, "text": "It's something that is actually should be fundamental to the way we interact with the world as part of our tooling."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "And that's where the Brave browser comes in."}, {"time": 7983, "text": "And I suppose others as well are playing with this idea, but Brave is at the forefront of that."}, {"time": 7987, "text": "So maybe can you like describe what Brave is and what are its key principles and what's broken and what is it Brave trying to fix?"}, {"time": 7996, "text": "So when I realized that these accidents like the third party cookie, the image or script that's tracking you or the JavaScripts that can do an invisibly now, that all this stuff wasn't intended and that Firefox had supported extensions that block some of these things, I thought probably we should have browsers just block some of these things by default."}, {"time": 8017, "text":

"text": "So how do you tell the first from the third party?"}, {"time": 8044, "text": "And it's not easy."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "It's not a matter of just what's embedded from a different server because a lot of publishers use benign scripts from unrelated domains or apparently unrelated domains."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "So you end up having to develop a sort of human and machine learning practice around blocking."}, {"time": 8059, "text": "And at Brave, we did that from the start and built a research team to help drive it and automate it."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "We realized that protecting people needed machine learning and around 2017 spring, I talked to my friends at Apple about this too and they were also doing what they call intelligent tracking prevention, which uses local machine learning in the browser."}, {"time": 8079, "text": "And the funny thing is, great minds think alike, they were taking their third party cookie blocker that was in Safari from the old days and making it not have a big loophole."}, {"time": 8088, "text": "Because what they did was in 2003, when Safari came out, they said, we're gonna block cookies that are from those third party embedded elements where you've never visited that site before."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "So I'm gonna pick an ad company that got sold to AT&T, so I'm not picking on anybody unfairly, appnexus.com."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "Have you ever been to appnexus.com?"}, {"time": 8107, "text": "I've never been there, but I guarantee you 10 years ago, you probably had, if you were using Firefox, you had a cookie, third party cookie, because you were being tracked by them and they were using that cookie to build up a profile of you."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "In Safari, as long as the user never went to appnexus, that cookie would not be set."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "And that was a real move for privacy early on when jobs were still around in Safari."}, {"time": 8127, "text": "But it had this loophole that if you do go to appnexus, then why it's okay to be a third party cookie."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "And so appnexus did something very naughty."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "They took their ad partners to put the actual ad you click on."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "And they said, hey, add a little script so that when somebody clicks on the ad, before it goes to your landing page, redirect to appnexus and we'll redirect to the landing page."}, {"time": 8147, "text": "And by doing that, they set a first party cookie and they got whitelisted."}, {"time": 8149, "text": "So it was a loophole they exploited."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "Intelligent tracking prevention in Safari was sophisticated enough to counteract this and it did other things and it's evolved since they did it."}, {"time": 8159, "text": "And we've evolved brave too."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "And so when I say machine and human learning, there's a real set of techniques here."}, {"time":

of storage in the browser associated with a website, if the bad guy can get 32 websites, each one has a bit of storage, that's 32 bits."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "You can turn the bit on or off, you can make 4 billion numbers, you can make an identifier."}, {"time": 8182, "text": "It's called a super cookie sometimes."}, {"time": 8186, "text": "There are weaker ways that are statistical."},

privacy in by default, by design, from the get go, not add it as an afterthought or go hogwile with new web APIs to add a bunch more local storage or fingerprint surface area."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "And that's been a struggle too, because guess who's the new Microsoft in the standards body?"}, {"time": 8211, "text": "It's Google."}, {"time": 8212, "text": "And they're not in favor of privacy first."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "They want to do privacy their way, only under, I would say, market pressure."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "But with Apple and with Brave leading the way, we block third party cookies almost without exception."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "So we've just blocked them."}, {"time": 8227, "text": "And that gives us a very strong privacy benefit, but it also means some sites just don't work right."}, {"time": 8233, "text": "Embedded YouTube videos might not work right."}, {"time": 8235, "text": "So we're adapting in a similar way to Apple's done with ITP to make third party cookies blocked, but to sort of simulate what looks like a working third party cookie for the site."}, {"time": 8248, "text": "It essentially tries to partition each site and its third parties into its own sort of cookie jar."}, {"time": 8255, "text": "And so, like you said, is this both like a human fine tuning issue and a machine learning problem?"}, {"time": 8262, "text": "And as the humans learn, then they train the machine learning."}, {"time": 8266, "text": "But, you know, maybe Google aside or including Google, there's millions of dollars, if not B, billions of dollars to be made from fighting the ways of Brave."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And it's been an interesting change from when we started in 2015."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "When we started, you know, ad blocking extensions, ad block plus was one of the big ones that started on Firefox in 2006, I believe, had gotten to a certain level of use around the world."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "And browsers like UC Web, UC Browser in Asia had some amount of ad blocking built in and on by default."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "So, a page fair was a startup and they measured ad blocking adoption."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "And they tried to say, hey publishers, you're, you know, 30% of the visitors to Pitchfork or Wire to Conda NAS properties are using ad blockers."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "If we can somehow convince them to lower their ad blocking for your site, that could be like a 43% lift, right?"}, {"time": 8319, "text": "And, you know, three sevenths."}, {"time": 8322, "text": "Well, that's easier said than done."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "And PageFair and others, SourcePoint, and many others tried to either smuggle ads through or cajole the user into letting, you know, ads appear."},

the fee."}, {"time": 8424, "text": "Now, I'm not a lawyer."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "I'm not gonna say this is a RICO predicate, but why is the ad exchange facilitating fraud and malware distribution

the internet has grown up to be."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "If Brave or something like Brave, the ideas, the fundamental philosophical ideas underlying Brave went out and runs 95% of the internet, how

come first."}, {"time": 9399, "text": "And if you give the users a better browser that's faster, then you'll get enough users to give back or support publishers."}, {"time": 9407, "text": "The speed
