in the United States, but in the world?"}, {"time": 402, "text": "As it's implemented in the 21st century, given the internet and all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 410, "text": "There is a Soviet dissident named Natan Sharansky who survived the regime and he wrote a book in which his thesis was essentially the way that you can define a free society is through something called the town square test."}, {"time": 428, "text": "Can you go to a public space where you live and criticize your ruler loudly without fear of retribution?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "If you can do that, you have free speech."}, {"time": 438, "text": "I think that's a pretty good litmus test."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Most people in this world cannot do that."}, {"time": 441, "text": "If you live in Havana, if you live in Moscow, if you live in Beijing, you cannot do that."}, {"time": 447, "text": "And that's not a free society."}, {"time": 449, "text": "In Austin, Texas, in Boston, Massachusetts, in London, in Santiago, Chile, in Tokyo, Japan, in many democracies, you can do that."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And I think that that's a really helpful basic sort of litmus test."}, {"time": 462, "text": "Does the content of the criticism matter?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "Can it be complete lies, meaning conspiracy theories that involve claiming that the leader is, let's say, a lizard slash pedophile slash, you know, I'm not saying that those are lies, look into it, but they're very unlikely phenomena."}, {"time": 488, "text": "So like, does that matter?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "I think it ends poorly when the state tries to restrict speech."}, {"time": 495, "text": "I think that's kind of how I would define censorship."}, {"time": 498, "text": "I think censorship and deplatforming are two different things."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Private companies, you know, they get to make up their own rules about what's allowed on their platforms."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And I think that's very different from a government with guns and an army restricting the speech of its citizens with threats of violence."}, {"time": 517, "text": "These things are different for me."}, {"time": 519, "text": "That violence is a fundamental difference."}, {"time": 522, "text": "I don't know, I've gotten the chance to have dinner with Alex Jones and I've talked to him a few times offline and it does, I understand why people are so off put by him, but it does bother me that he's universally removed from every platform."}, {"time": 540, "text": "It feels like there's many more evil people, bad people compared to Alex Jones who still are given a voice on these platforms."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And so I'm uncomfortable with the universality of the application of the censorship by these platforms."}, {"time": 562, "text": "But on the flip side, you're right."}, {"time": 563, "text": "There's not a violence, there's not tanks, there's not guns behind that censorship."}, {"time": 570, "text": "It's a bit of a generalization, but Alex Jones would be in prison or dead if he were in North Korea or in Cuba or in Russia or in China, that the authorities would not tolerate him to do what he did."}, {"time": 582, "text": "And here he can kind of do what he wants."}, {"time": 585, "text": "He's encountering some resistance in the marketplace of ideas, large organizations, corporations, and a lot of public sentiment in different parts of our country don't like him."}, {"time": 598, "text": "They're doing their best to drown out his voice, but that's very different from a violent threat of censorship from the state."}, {"time": 605, "text": "And that's what we study."}, {"time": 606, "text": "That's what I study are these, you know, what is the state doing?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "That's kind of paramount for me."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And that's true because in the marketplace of ideas, there could be a company that springs up that gives Alex Jones a platform and the United States is not going to prevent those companies from functioning."}, {"time": 622, "text": "Of course, there's from a technology perspective, there is AWS removing Parler from the platform and gets a little weird, you know, as you get closer and closer to the computer infrastructure, because then you get closer and closer to the state, actually, the more you get to the infrastructure that's usually managed by the state, the closer it gets to then the control of the state."}, {"time": 648, "text": "I would argue AWS is pretty damn close to infrastructure that's kind of controlled by the state."}, {"time": 654, "text": "If you especially look at other nations, China, Russia, there's, I don't know who runs the computer infrastructure for Russia and China, but I bet the state has complete oversight over that."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And so that level of computer infrastructure, having control about which social networks can and cannot operate is very uncomfortable to me."}, {"time": 677, "text": "But you're right, I think it's good to focus on the obvious violations of these principles as opposed to the gray areas."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Of course, the gray areas are fascinating."}, {"time": 688, "text": "You mentioned HRF, Human Rights Foundation."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Yes, I've been working for HRF since 2007."}, {"time": 699, "text": "We are a charity, a nonprofit, a 501c3 based in New York, and our mission is to promote and protect individual rights and freedoms in authoritarian societies around the world."}, {"time": 712, "text": "So again, we define about 95 countries as authoritarian, meaning it's either a one party state or opposition politicians are outlawed or persecuted, there's no real free speech, there's no press freedom, there's no independent judiciary, there really aren't checks and balances and even trying to create like a human rights organization or like an environmental group would be illegal."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And the majority of the world's population lives in that environment."}, {"time": 737, "text": "You said 53%."}, {"time": 738, "text": "53%, 4.3 billion people."}, {"time": 740, "text": "And I saw you outlined a lot of different sources of suffering in the world."}, {"time": 747, "text": "And then you sort of put people living under authoritarian governments as like more than all of them."}, {"time": 755, "text": "I forget all the examples you provided, but then... Sure."}, {"time": 759, "text": "I mean, it's... Yeah, maybe you can mention if you remember."}, {"time": 761, "text": "The number of people who are refugees, the number of people who suffer from natural disasters, the number of people who live under abject poverty, the number of people who don't have access to clean drinking water, all of these are dwarfed by the number of people who live under authoritarianism."}, {"time": 774, "text": "And yet it's not something that we talk about a lot because people are mercantilist and the powers that be are happy to sacrifice freedoms and privacy for money."}, {"time": 784, "text": "We live in a profit seeking world."}, {"time": 787, "text": "To get evidence of this, take a look at the list of sponsors of the upcoming Olympics in China where the CCP is currently committing genocide against the weaker population or look at the number of people and the famous investors who went to Saudi Arabia a couple months ago for the Davos in the desert."}, {"time": 803, "text": "I mean, Ray Dalio was there, all kinds of people were there, or at least they were invited and they said they were gonna go."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And this is a government that at the time was torturing a female activist who just wanted to drive a car."}, {"time": 816, "text": "This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi in a brutal fashion just a couple years earlier."}, {"time": 823, "text": "So, I mean, at the end of the day when it comes down to brass tacks, I mean, the powers that be, even the free countries are led by people who are very, very happy to sacrifice all these pretty words about human rights when it comes down to profits, unfortunately."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So, do you think capitalism, that's maybe one of the flaws of capitalism is it turns a blind eye to injustices against human nature, against the human rights, like it turns a blind eye to authoritarian governments?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "Look, I think that at the end of the day, like free trade is actually really good."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And you can just look at France and Germany as an example of how like a capitalist structure would develop."}, {"time": 868, "text": "If you have two capitalist actors, they're very unlikely to fight each other."}, {"time": 871, "text": "There's very unlikely to be violence, right?"}, {"time": 873, "text": "These are two countries which basically murdered some large percentage of each other's male population three times in a hundred years in three different wars, right?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "And now today, war is like unthinkable and a lot of that is because of increased collaboration, increased trade."}, {"time": 888, "text": "So, when you have two capitalist actors, they act in a very productive way with each other."}, {"time": 894, "text": "But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor, all bets are off."}, {"time": 899, "text": "So, I think what you have is a conflict between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And at the end of the day, people need to, yes, have more than just capitalist intentions in the geopolitical level I'm talking about, they need to actually take a stand for principles."}, {"time": 918, "text": "Otherwise, you have athletes and businesses and governments that are all too happy to do business with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now."}, {"time": 928, "text": "I think that there is a little more than just kind of the pure profit, yes."}, {"time": 934, "text": "You mentioned what are the signs that the state is an authoritarian state."}, {"time": 941, "text": "How do you know if you're living in an authoritarian state or when you study another nation and analyze the behavior of another nation, how do you know that's an authoritarian state?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "Is it as simple as them having a dictator?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "Is it as simple as them as declaring that they don't have a democracy or is there something more subtle?"}, {"time": 959, "text": "There's a couple of good litmus tests."}, {"time": 961, "text": "One is actually, can you have a gay pride parade?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "It actually lines up perfectly, it doesn't matter what religion the dictatorship is."}, {"time": 970, "text": "They don't like minorities and they love to scapegoat, whether it's gays or religious minorities, etc."}, {"time": 976, "text": "So it lines up pretty well."}, {"time": 978, "text": "If you cannot have a gay pride parade in your country, because you're fearful that you're going to get the crap kicked out of you, probably live in an authoritarian regime."}, {"time": 987, "text": "I'm sure that's not just about some kind of homophobia."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Because that's right."}, {"time": 994, "text": "I'm going through... Fascism scapegoats minorities."}, {"time": 997, "text": "There's an other, you create an other group and then you... Yeah, I mean Uganda is a great example of this, but so is Saudi Arabia, so is China."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "I mean, so is Cuba."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "I mean, these are all regimes which demonize the LGBT communities."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "It's interesting because maybe you can correct me, but from my very distant outside of perspective, the sort of the way that certain authoritarian governments speak about gay people is it's almost like, what is it?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "We don't have gay people in our country kind of idea as opposed to scapegoating, which is like... Total denial is the most powerful form of demonization."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "I mean, this is what the Iranian dictatorship does."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "A few years ago when Ahmadinejad, who was then sort of the de facto leader, he came to Columbia University and he tried to give a speech, which you can look up and he tried to claim that there were no gays in Iran."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And that's the most powerful form of demonization is trying to just wipe out your utter existence."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "There's other good litmus tests too."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "For example, you can think about comedy."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Can you make money making fun of your government on television?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "If you cannot, you live in a dictatorship most likely."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "I mean, it's shocking to people that I work with who live in dictatorships when I tell them that not only are comedians able to safely make fun of our government, but they get paid very well to do so."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "That's a hallmark of our free society."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "That's another good litmus test."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "Hear that Tim Dylan, you should go to North Korea, check it out."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And look, there are tons of flaws with democracies."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "This is a really good test by the way."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "The United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Our prison system is a disaster."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "There's a horrible war on drugs."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "We committed a grievous crime in my opinion by invading Iraq."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "We did a lot of problematic things, but our core architecture is still an open society."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "The people who criticize the US the most usually live within it."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And if they were to move to a different country and try to use that criticism against their new rulers, they wouldn't fare so well."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So whether it's Chomsky or whomever, if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba and try to criticize Cuba like they do America, it wouldn't last very long."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "So I think what's important to distinguish between open societies and closed ones or like free societies and authoritarian regimes, it doesn't mean that your government's going to be good all the time."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "What it means is that the citizens have a way to push for reform, have a way to hold the rulers accountable."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So even if you don't like what the US government does, whether it was under Biden or Trump or Obama or Bush, we can rotate them through voting."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And we have an independent Supreme Court that rotates over time."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And we have people that we can elect directly to serve our interests."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And then there's like a free press and there's lobbyists and all kinds of people that jostle for power."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "So there's a separation of powers."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "And I like to think about a free society really as like at the bottom of the foundation of the pyramid really would be free speech."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And then you would have civil society, like for example, human rights organizations, environmental groups, stamp collectors, athletes, any groups that come together beyond the government's sort of strict instruction."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And then on top of that, at the third level, you have separation of powers, again, what I'm describing."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So authoritarian regimes don't really have any of these layers to them."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And then at the top, then you put elections, but the elections are meaningless if you don't have the foundation below."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Every dictator gets elected."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Kim Jong Un gets elected."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "He's the only person on the ballot."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez, they all got elected."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Elections on their own mean literally nothing."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "You have to have these other layers beneath to actually be an open and free society."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "I think it's very important for people to understand."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Although Hitler in an interesting way, at a certain point just said, I'm going to be a ruler forever, which is interesting."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "There's an important switch that happens when you, as opposed to having a facade of elections, you just put that aside and saying basically like, we're not even doing this."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "There's like a ladder that you climb the election and you pull the ladder up and then no one else can climb up."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "After Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring, Morsi came in and it looked like the Muslim Brotherhood was not really going to be very democratic."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "But it didn't really matter because then the military came back and now we have Sisi who's even worse than Mubarak."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "So a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately, it's very difficult for people to build that democratic society afterwards."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Some people have told me that when you live in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime, it's kind of like a political desert."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "What grows in the desert?"}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Scorpions and cacti, right?"}, {"time": 1290, "text": "So basically people with very extreme views because you as an authoritarian ruler, your best method for control is to get rid of the moderates."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "You have to crush the moderates."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "You want to have the only opposition to you be extremists."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "That way when you go and have negotiations with the United States, you can kind of hold up the terrorists or whomever, the extremists and say, it's either us or them, right?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And then the realists who run the US government are going to choose you."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And that's why, one of the reasons why the US government has supported so many dictators around the world over the last few decades."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Do you think authoritarian systems emerge naturally, like that's the natural state of things."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "If you incorporate what human nature is, is there always going to be corrupt people the rise to the top?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And we almost have to construct systems that protect us against ourselves kind of thing."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "Another way to ask that is what kind of systems protect us from our own human nature?"}, {"time": 1350, "text": "We started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Ruled by one or a small group oligarchy, and all humans lived under this structure for, you know, the virtual, you know, bulk of all human existence."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "Only until pretty recently did we start having actual democracy."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "The idea that we should be ruled by rules, not by rulers, very powerful."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Invented in many places across the world."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Western Africa had this idea and so did the ancient Greeks."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And they started to implement it."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Although as most know, we didn't have full democracy for a long, long time because it was only property owners or only men, only people of a certain race."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But this idea that we can like rotate our rulers and that we could be ruled by rules is extremely powerful and it really like for me, the ideas behind this, I think unlocked a lot of the industrial revolution, these small personal freedoms that were allowed in some countries, but not others."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation over the last few hundred years."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "And to me, there's like a really straight line between like scientific inquiry, free speech, freedoms, and then more prosperity and more effectiveness as a civilization."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people is definitely an upgrade from autocracy or oligarchy, you know, which would be ruled by one or ruled by a small group."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And I think that the democratic revolution has been an incredible thing for our world."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "And it's, you know, you can do half class full, half class empty."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "The half class full is that almost half the world lives under democracy."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Like that's an incredible achievement."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "But just under half."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "Just under half."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "But that's billions of people."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "It's billions of people."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And if you look at the progress of things, it's getting better and better and better."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "I mean, if you, you know."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "We're a little bit of a stalemate here."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "Democracy's really blossomed between World War II and the year 2000, especially in the eighties and nineties, you had an incredible wave of fall, you know, where many, many authoritarian regimes fell and were replaced by democracies."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "I think around 2015, the acceleration kind of came to a standstill a little bit."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "There's some good news in some countries and there's bad news in others."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Like in the last 10 years, you've had, for example, the Philippines has gone backwards."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Thailand has gone backwards."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Bangladesh has gone backwards."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "Turkey has gone backwards."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "That's like a half billion people right there."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So you've had some positives, like, you know, there was positive movement forward in Armenia, Malaysia, some other countries, but we're kind of at a stalemate right now."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And what most people fear about where we are right now, who I respect, is what is the digital transformation of the world due to this like progress of democracy or of open societies."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And that's what concerns me the most."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "So I've, and we'll talk about one of the most fascinating technologies, which is Bitcoin, how it can help."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "But I have a sense that technology, like most technological innovations will give power to the individuals, will fight authoritarian governments as opposed to give more power to authoritarian governments."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "But your sense is there's ways to give for technology to be utilized as a tool for the abuse of the citizenry."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "I've seen both."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "In my work at Ahrefs, I started by helping to put together backpacks with foreign information that we sent to the Cuban underground library movement."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So in Cuba, you know, to own a book at the time, you had to have the government's permission."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "There's very little internet penetration."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "So we would send in movies, you know, V for Vendetta, dubbed into Spanish, and people would sit inside their homes and they'd watch it and they would answer questions with each other."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "It was awful."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And then after that, I worked with people inside North Korea."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "We would send in flash drives."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "We have this program called Flash Drives for Freedom."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "We've sent over 100,000 flash drives in our work into North Korea, a country of about 25 million people."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "It's a big, big difference."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "That's, you know, many, many millions of hours of films, books, movies, etc."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "So I've seen the power that technology can have where, you know, in the 60s and 70s, you know, to get to break an information blockade, you had to like send in crates of books into a communist country."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So now all of a sudden, you can send the entire contents of what was once the Library of Alexandria on something the size of your thumbnail, like that's remarkable."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So obviously, I've seen the positives of technology and we'll certainly get into Bitcoin."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "But I'm, you know, very concerned about essentially big data analysis, like what people call AI or general, you know, specific kinds of AI, like very concerning."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "I think these are very authoritarian."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "I mean, it's very hard to make a case that AI is going to be good for human rights."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Very difficult, in my opinion."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "It may be good for health."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "It may be good for our efforts to protect the planet."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "It may be good for a lot of scientific things."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "I find it very hard to believe it'll be good for civil liberties."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Oh, that's fun."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "This is fun because I disagree."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "Give me your examples."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "What AI applications will improve civil liberties?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "I thought you meant examples of stuff that's already out there, because I can give you examples that, for example, the kind of things I would like to work on, but also the kind of things I'm hoping to see, which is AI could be used by centralized powers, by governments, by big organizations like Facebook and Twitter and so on to collect data about people."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "I believe there's a huge hunger among people to have control over their own data."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "So instead you can have AI that's distributed or people have complete ownership of their little AI systems."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So like the kind of stuff that I would like to build or like to see it to be built is you could think of it as personal assistance or AI that's owned by you and you get to give it out."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "You have complete control over all of your data."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "You have complete control over everything that's learnable about your day to day experiences that could be useful in the market of goods and ideas and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So it has to do with, so I know you talk about the surveillance, which is very interesting."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "It's who gets to have control of the data."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "And I think, I believe there's a lot of hunger in among regular people to have control over their data such that if you want to create a business, you have a lot of money to be made from a capitalist perspective by providing products that let people control their data where you

you really can't say no, even if you know what's inside of it, is at play in Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So like in Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right?"}, {"time": 3809, "text": "It is what we call it in sort of shorthand NGO, NGU, right?"}, {"time": 3813, "text": "But what people don't realize is that NGU is like the Trojan horse."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "Inside the Trojan

Bitcoin on TV are maybe investor types."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "Yeah, professional investors, corporations and soon governments."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "I mean, you just had today this morning

3938, "text": "And for it to do to define that a little further as meaning it does seem like the more people get excited and start using Bitcoin, the more its value grows."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "So it's just a good feedback loop."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Yeah, it's a feedback loop."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And then the reason you're excited about it, especially is that F.G.

Tesla stacks Bitcoin, they're just doing that as self interest."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "They think it's going to be a good inflation hedge."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "But what they maybe don't care about, don't realize or they don't need to care."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "I mean, Bitcoin's power is it like co ops people into promoting a freedom tool, even if they don't care about or even if they hate freedom, doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up and more interest goes up and more people around the world are like, wow, Bitcoin, then more people get involved again."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "More adoption, more price, more developers, better user interface, more privacy tools, more mining, more network security."}, {"time": 3998,

there's one place where everything is made public in terms of everything that ever happened?"}, {"time": 4320, "text": "And I'll give you two reasons."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "Number one, the Bitcoin blockchain is ultimately a settlement layer."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "It's kind of like something like Fedwire in the United States."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "It's a way for like institutions to settle with each other."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "That's what I think it's going to be like in 20, 30 years from now."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "The average person is never going to touch the Bitcoin blockchain probably."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "They're going to use things like lightning or unfortunately, they may use Bitcoin banks, but they'll either use custodians or they'll use second layer noncustodial solutions to interact."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "The main chain is going to get very expensive."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "It's going to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars or even more if the dollar starts to weaken to make a transaction on the main chain."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "And that will be reserved for like very large transactions or transactions that need final final settlement, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And I think that that's fine and that's okay."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And it's very important that that ledger, that settlement layer be kept by thousands of people around the world."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "The Bitcoin blockchain is not centralized."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "It is decentralized."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "It is run by people like me who run a node at home."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "I run a personal server."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "I run the Bitcoin

you have a full node?"}, {"time": 4395, "text": "I run a full node."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "That's great, man."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "You run it and that way you can be sovereign over all of your usage, right?"}, {"time": 4402, "text": "And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi with less than 150 bucks of equipment."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And that's so important because again, there is no

"We are Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And I think that that's very, very powerful."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "And then you can have something like a lightning network where you can escape some of the constraints of the blockchain, depending on your needs of the privacy and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "Everything's an engineering trade off, but yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances of the base layer to go into lightning, for example, and there you can get more speed and more privacy."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And the things that Bitcoin lacks, speed and privacy, for example, you can get on these second layers."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So there's all kinds of cool engineering things that people are coming up with."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "But I also want to say anyone who says the blockchain, like that's a red flag for that person doesn't really know what they're talking about."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "Like Satoshi didn't use the blockchain in the white paper."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "Blockchain was a marketing term that people came up with later to try and do this thing that was kind of like it peaked in 2015 and it continues to be an issue today of it's blockchain not Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "And that was like a very corporate kind of social attack on Bitcoin to say we could take this ledger part of

chronologically of transactions."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "It's really not that exciting."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "The exciting part of Bitcoin is the proof of work where the transaction processing is done by mining and by energy and by real world expenditures instead of like, you know, some central ledger."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And you know, when you remove the blockchain from Bitcoin, it's not very, to me, it's just not that interesting."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "I don't know, to me, blockchain or time chain, whatever, as it philosophically is a pretty beautiful idea."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "I mean, it's pretty simple, but it's nevertheless as beautiful from a big database person."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "It's an interesting way to store information that, especially that's totally publicly accessible."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "It's I know that to Bitcoin proof of work is the fundamental idea, but to cryptocurrency and digital money in general and to money, the blockchain is a really interesting idea to me."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "The way I think about it is it's kind of, you know, physics."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "And I like that there's a place that you can rely on that's very difficult to mess with."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "What it's not though, like it's outside of maybe Ethereum."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "Every other blockchain is easy to mess with."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So you're saying that proof of work is what makes it hard to mess with."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "Proof of work is the key."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "And Ethereum is about to leave proof of work."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "So it's about to go to proof of stake, which is literally the existing system where a small group of people get to decide the

a political science perspective."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "For me, it's all about freedom versus dictatorship."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And that's why I find it so compelling that regardless of how much power or might or how many armies you have, you can't change the rules of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "If you're wrong about Bitcoin, what would that look like?"}, {"time": 4605, "text":

5812, "text": "So they continue to iterate, but the censorship deplatforming piece, I'm not sure it's fixable because if you, I mean, you watch the US government haul these people, haul Zuckerberg and Dorsey and whatever in front of Congress, they want more censorship."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "I mean, our elected leaders want more censorship, right?"}, {"time": 5831, "text": "See, I just believe censorship is a really harsh word."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "I believe it's possible to create technologies where it's not Twitter doing the censorship, but it's individuals doing their own selection of what they want and don't want to see."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump and whatever he says, or you love Donald Trump, you get to select yourself."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "Like you get to have more control over what you consume."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "Twitter tries to do that a little bit, but they obviously fail where ideas infiltrate our view that misinformation spreads really fast and conspiracy theories spread really fast to where the immune system that Twitter has created to try to censor conspiracy theories and misinformation is over firing and you're now censoring too many people."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "So it's exactly the same intuition as you said before."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "If the state is doing it, in this case, Twitter is kind of the state that's not going to work out well."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Let's keep it simple."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "Let's look at one example, Twitter and Jack Dorsey."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "And I think it's quite clear that what he believes is the solution is as you're kind of hinting at a more kind of like regionalized system, which is not have one we call federated system, right?"}, {"time": 5953, "text": "Which does not just have like one company in charge of everything, but there's an open protocol and then there's like different instances, right?"}, {"time": 5958, "text": "So Twitter may, you know, Jack's dream for Twitter is that Twitter is this open protocol that the Russian government can use and the Chinese government can use and the Iranian government can use and the American government can use and then Twitter as a company is going to use too."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "And you as the customer decide which implementation you want to join and there's going to be different censorship on each instance or each federation, but the protocol itself would be like untouchable."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right?"}, {"time": 5986, "text": "There's like different parts of the internet that are censored, but like at the very bottom of the very bottom of the backbone of it, it's like this globally connected relatively unstoppable thing, right?"}, {"time": 5998, "text": "So I think that's a pretty good vision and Twitter is working towards that with the blue sky initiative."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "I'm a little skeptical that it like works out because I've used Mastodon, for example."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "Mastodon is an example of a federated social media."}, {"time": 6013, "text": "Now it's ruled by a benevolent."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "Each instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "It's just like I happen to like this one, so I know."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "So rather than trust one dictator, Twitter, you could choose which dictator you want to trust and that's kind of the federated model and maybe we head that way, but you lose things."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "When it's federated, you lose the UX, you lose the slickness and the feel and all the millions of dollars they spend on developers."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "Like Mastodon is like not anywhere close to as nice to use as Twitter."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "So I feel like it's, again, it's this trade off that we make with everything where it's convenience, comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right?"}, {"time": 6050, "text": "It's very hard to have something that gives you both."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "I think, I think, uh, yeah, it is a trade off."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "Have you used one of these things that I feel like is good?"}, {"time": 6057, "text": "The federated, they're not, they're not, they're not, but the federated, I don't think it's, it's a good, I think, uh, it requires genius, it requires skill, it requires great design to come up with a way to, you know, there's a Pareto front here, there's a right way to hit that trade off."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And I honestly think there's the UX, the experience should be centralized, should be designed by the company, but the data and like a lot of stuff that could be used to violate your basic rights should be owned by the individual."}, {"time": 6126, "text": "And maybe it's, maybe it's one button that you click and it asks, are you sure?"}, {"time": 6131, "text": "And you have to be able to say yes."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "Like that's a feature that's fundamental to a good social network, I believe."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "Like currently social networks, first of all, most of them don't allow you to do that."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "They don't make it transparent how much data they had, who they shared it with."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "And they also make it exceptionally difficult to delete accounts."}, {"time": 6150, "text": "So like that's a very basic starting point, but that having that button means that you have control, but that's step one of the control."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "There's a transparency of knowing exactly when, what data is being shared about you, how much data is already being recorded about you, all that is transparency."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "And I believe in the, I believe that's a really good business model, because when there's transparency and control, people would be willing to give over a lot more data as long as they know what they're given over, as long as they know what they can delete."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "I guess maybe you're more optimistic about people caring about, I feel like not so few people actually care about their privacy and freedom."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "I've just watched everybody give it up, you know, but we'll see, I guess just to book in that I think we're at this moment where obviously the centralized platforms are just so much easier and better to use and to strike it out and, you know, adventure out and use a like a federated instance or something even like Keybase, which is kind of like a cool encrypted way to like have group chats."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "It just requires like a lot of your time and a lot of people don't have that time."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "But I will say one thing, like I do think there is this future where we do go into more of this like, it's called a tribal model or like tribes, which is this social environment being built on top of lightning by an app called Sphinx."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "And the idea is like kind of like it's like a decentralized Slack, like you have your Slack instance, which has like a bunch of people in the community and you have different ways to message each other and it's all encrypted."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "And then it has like plugins for like things like Jitsi instead of Zoom."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "So like an open source encrypted video messenger."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "It has ways to like plug in the content you want to get from like different platforms that you follow, like podcasts, things like that."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "And again, it allows you to pay those people directly in a censorship resistant private way."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "So it's really nice to connect to the lightning network."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "So it's all sort of built on lightning, but the idea you can think about it as like you're slowly starting to build up the idea of a WeChat, but with freedom principles."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "Because right now, WeChat's like the king of convenience and comfort, but of course it's feeding all that data to the big brother and the surveillance state."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "And then we have like our own versions over here in America that are not quite as convenient or amazing, but like we give up slightly less privacy and freedom."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "But this thing has a lot of promising features to it."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "It's worth checking out."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "It's very like early days."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "Like it feels like, I mean, I was pretty young, but it feels like the nineties in the internet."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "Like it has that feeling where you, yeah, you know it's rough around the edges, but you can feel the magic."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "I'm very much like with Steve Jobs on this."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "I think the founding principles are exceptionally important, but at the end of the day, the design of how sleek it is, how easy it is to use."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And that's not just like pretty icing on the cake."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "That is the icing is the cake because like how easy it is to use, how natural it is."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "It's the Trojan horse thing."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "Like you don't get, it has to be pretty and shiny and it has to have, it has to fundamentally connect to the basics of human nature, which is what is pleasant to use, what feels good to use."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "You have to, you know, to trick people into eating the broccoli, you have to put like a delicious whatever on it."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "Well, again, PGP is a kind of a pain to use, right?"}, {"time": 6353, "text": "For if you want privacy."}, {"time": 6355, "text": "So Signal is an upgrade."}, {"time": 6356, "text": "Signal is way better."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "I mean, and it's way better than it was five years ago and it's, it's not quite as good as like not quite as seamless, right, as like a WhatsApp yet, but it's almost there."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "And they were able to do it and you're going to see that with, with Bitcoin wallets as well."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "I mean, they're, they're almost there."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "They're like, if you use like a moon wallet is like, I mean, it's so cool looking and it's so seamless and they've spent so many hours thinking about your experience."}, {"time": 6382, "text": "We are getting there."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "Whereas 10 years ago, it was like impossible to use."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "One of the things that Signal doesn't have, and I believe these kinds of applications need to have is like a, I hate the term, but killer app, which is like a dumb, but very viral and popular reason to switch it."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "I didn't see exactly, I mean, I've been using Signal, but I haven't seen a you know, a big reason to, to switch."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "Well, you're on it, man."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "To switch."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "I mean, the reason."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "But I haven't switched everything to it, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "Like a. Yeah."}, {"time": 6418, "text": "The exodus to Signal was in, in January, they had a huge user surge for two main reasons."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "One hilariously enough, of course, was Elon tweeted, like you should use Signal, right?"}, {"time": 6429, "text": "Which is not insignificant."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And then the other one was that like WhatsApp changed kind of some of its terms of service and like, you know, announced to all of its users in this little pop up that it was going to be sort of like changing the way it handled your data."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "That spooked a lot of people."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "So these two things really combined and tens of millions of people in the following weeks between January and February joined Signal."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "It's like it really has had its day in the sun and they are like frantically trying to keep up with it."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "Like, and it's really nice to see that, that, that this encrypted messaging service, which, which prioritizes your privacy in a way that, you know, you know, the government again may know like the metadata, but doesn't know exactly what you're saying

took all these courses on and interviewed all these decision makers, whether they were like neocons or whatever, different people who were involved."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "And the whole like dollar reserve currency thing like really never came up until like I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "And today when I look back, it seems kind of obvious

like, no, we actually don't want you to sell dollars in euros because that would threaten the dollar."}, {"time": 8563, "text": "So we're going to invade you and then you're not going to do it and
