[{"title": "Yoshua Bengio: Deep Learning | Lex Fridman Podcast #4", "id": "azOmzumh0vQ", "quotes": [{"time": 477, "text": "Yeah, I've heard you mention in several contexts, the idea of sort of the way children learn, they interact with objects in the world."}, {"time": 484, "text": "And it seems fascinating because in some sense, except with some cases in reinforcement learning, that idea is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So it's almost like, do you envision something like an objective function saying, you know what, if you poke this object in this kind of way, it would be really helpful for me to further learn."}, {"time": 517, "text": "Sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Right, right, right."}, {"time": 520, "text": "So I was talking to Rebecca Sacks just a few minutes ago, and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in a directed way."}, {"time": 532, "text": "And so they're not passive learners, they focus their attention on aspects of the world, which are most interesting, surprising in a non trivial way."}, {"time": 550, "text": "That makes them change their theories of the world."}, {"time": 556, "text": "So that's a fascinating view of the future progress."}, {"time": 556, "text": "But on a more maybe boring question, do you think going deeper and larger, so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years, is going to be a big thing?"}, {"time": 578, "text": "I think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress."}, {"time": 584, "text": "So some of the representational issues that you mentioned, they're kind of shallow, in some sense."}, {"time": 594, "text": "Oh, shallow in the sense of abstraction."}, {"time": 598, "text": "In the sense of abstraction, they're not getting some..."}, {"time": 600, "text": "I don't think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers, you're going to have more layers."}, {"time": 606, "text": "I don't think so."}, {"time": 606, "text": "Is that obvious to you?"}, {"time": 611, "text": "What is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better."}, {"time": 625, "text": "But I don't think that's going to be nearly enough."}, {"time": 625, "text": "I think we need changes in the way that we're considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way the environment in which they are, you know, observing and acting."}, {"time": 646, "text": "But I guess I was trying to ask a question that's more interesting than just more layers."}, {"time": 653, "text": "It's basically, once you figure out a way to learn through interacting, how many parameters it takes to store that information."}, {"time": 660, "text": "So I think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Oh, I see what you mean."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Oh, I'm with you there."}, {"time": 667, "text": "So I agree that in order to build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have, probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And so it's going to get better."}, {"time": 690, "text": "However, the good news in a way, which is also a bad news, is that even our state of the art, deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments, like some grid worlds that we have built."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Even these fairly simple environments, I mean, of course, if you train them with enough examples, eventually they get it."}, {"time": 716, "text": "But it's just like, instead of what humans might need just dozens of examples, these things will need millions for very, very, very simple tasks."}, {"time": 730, "text": "And so I think there's an opportunity for academics who don't have the kind of computing power that, say, Google has to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in training frameworks, learning models, agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic, that seem trivial, but yet current machine learning fails on."}, {"time": 758, "text": "We talked about priors and common sense knowledge."}, {"time": 758, "text": "It seems like we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted."}, {"time": 763, "text": "So what's your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world, this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "So knowledge, for a while, the artificial intelligence was maybe in the 80s, like there's a time where knowledge representation, knowledge, acquisition, expert systems, I mean, the symbolic AI was a view, was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit, it seems like."}, {"time": 802, "text": "Because it doesn't work."}, {"time": 807, "text": "It doesn't work."}, {"time": 807, "text": "But that's right."}, {"time": 807, "text": "But the goals of that remain important."}, {"time": 814, "text": "Remain important."}, {"time": 814, "text": "And how do you think those goals can be addressed?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "So first of all, I believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed is because a lot of the knowledge we have, so you talked about common sense intuition, there's a lot of knowledge like this, which is not consciously accessible."}, {"time": 841, "text": "There are lots of decisions we're taking that we can't really explain, even if sometimes we make up a story."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And that knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems, rule based systems and classical AI formalism."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And there are other issues, of course, with the old AI, like not really good ways of handling uncertainty, I would say something more subtle, which we understand better now, but I think still isn't enough in the minds of people."}, {"time": 877, "text": "There's something really powerful that comes from distributed representations, the thing that really makes neural nets work so well."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And it's hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world."}, {"time": 889, "text": "The knowledge in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Whereas if you think about a neural net, it's the opposite."}, {"time": 904, "text": "You have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to represent everything the network knows."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And it's not sufficiently factorized."}, {"time": 910, "text": "It's not sufficiently factorized."}, {"time": 916, "text": "And so I think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets, that we have to take lessons from classical AI in order to bring in another kind of compositionality, which is common in language, for example, and in these rules, but that isn't so native to neural nets."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And on that line of thinking, disentangled representations."}, {"time": 938, "text": "So let me connect with disentangled representations, if you might, if you don't mind."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So for many years, I've thought, and I still believe that it's really important that we come up with learning algorithms, either unsupervised or supervised, but reinforcement, whatever, that build representations in which the important factors, hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up from the representation."}, {"time": 973, "text": "So that's the idea of disentangled representations."}, {"time": 973, "text": "It says transform the data into a space where everything becomes easy."}, {"time": 978, "text": "We can maybe just learn with linear models about the things we care about."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And I still think this is important, but I think this is missing out on a very important ingredient, which classical AI systems can remind us of."}, {"time": 998, "text": "So let's say we have these disentangled representations."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You still need to learn about the relationships between the variables, those high level semantic variables."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "They're not going to be independent."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "I mean, this is like too much of an assumption."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "They're going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future, to explain what happened in the past."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "The kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical AI system is encoded in the rules."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "Like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says, oh, I have these two, three, four variables that are linked in this interesting way, then I can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others, right?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "In addition to disentangling the elements of the representation, which are like the variables in a rule based system, you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those variables to each other."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So like the rules."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So the rules are neatly separated."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Like each rule is, you know, living on its own."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And when I change a rule because I'm learning, it doesn't need to break other rules."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Whereas current neural nets, for example, are very sensitive to what's called catastrophic forgetting, where after I've learned some things and then I learn new things, they can destroy the old things that I had learned, right?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "If the knowledge was better factorized and separated, disentangled, then you would avoid a lot of that."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Now, you can't do this in the sensory domain."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "What do you mean by sensory domain?"}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Like in pixel space."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "But my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space, it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs to representations, which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on in a way that can be neatly disentangled."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "So now it's the rules that are disentangled from each other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel, like does there need to be an architectural difference?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So there's the sensory space like pixels, which where everything is entangled."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "The information, like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And also computation, like it's not just the variables, it's also how they are related to each other is all intertwined."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "But I'm hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space, both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And that will provide a lot of generalization power."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Generalization power."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "This is where current machine learning is too weak."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "It doesn't tell us anything, is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets, say, are going to generalize to a new distribution."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And, you know, people may think, well, but there's nothing we can say if we don't know what the new distribution will be."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "The truth is humans are able to generalize to new distributions."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "How are we able to do that?"}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Because there is something, these new distributions, even though they could look very different from the training distributions, they have things in common."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So let me give you a concrete example."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "You read a science fiction novel."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "The science fiction novel, maybe, you know, brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface, but it's still the same laws of physics."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "And so you can read the book and you understand what's going on."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So the distribution is very different."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "But because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from Earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that, and maybe even social interactions, you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet where, like, visually, for example, things are totally different."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Taking that analogy further and distorting it, let's enter a science fiction world of, say, Space Odyssey, 2001, with Hal."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Or maybe, which is probably one of my favorite AI movies."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And then there's another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside of the AI community is Ex Machina."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I don't know if you've seen it."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "By the way, what are your views on that movie?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Are you able to enjoy it?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Are there things I like and things I hate?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So you could talk about that in the context of a question I want to ask, which is, there's quite a large community of people from different backgrounds, often outside of AI, who are concerned about existential threat of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "You've seen this community develop over time."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "You've seen you have a perspective."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So what do you think is the best way to talk about AI safety, to think about it, to have discourse about it within AI community and outside and grounded in the fact that Ex Machina is one of the main sources of information for the general public about AI?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So I think you're putting it right."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "There's a big difference between the sort of discussion we ought to have within the AI community and the sort of discussion that really matter in the general public."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So I think the picture of Terminator and AI loose and killing people and super intelligence that's going to destroy us, whatever we try, isn't really so useful for the public discussion."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Just to clarify, when you said killer robots, you mean autonomous weapon, weapon systems."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Yes, I don't mean that's right."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "So I think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Now, existential risk, for me is a very unlikely consideration, but still worth academic investigation in the same way that you could say, should we study what could happen if meteorite, you know, came to earth and destroyed it."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "So I think it's very unlikely that this is going to happen in or happen in a reasonable future."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "The sort of scenario of an AI getting loose goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural nets and so on."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "It's not plausible to me."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "But of course, I don't have a crystal ball and who knows what AI will be in 50 years from now."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "So I think it is worth that scientists study those problems."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It's just not a pressing question as far as I'm concerned."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So before I continue down that line, I have a few questions there."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "But what do you like and not like about Ex Machina as a movie?"}, {"time": 1445, "text": "Because I actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I hated it the first time, and I enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when I sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it, see it as a concept movie."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "What was your experience?"}, {"time": 1463, "text": "What were your thoughts?"}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Science in general and AI in particular."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Science is not happening in some hidden place by some, you know, really smart guy, one person."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "This is totally unrealistic."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "This is not how it happens."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Science moves by small steps, thanks to the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And all the scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on, even in the industrial labs."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "It's information flows and leaks and so on."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movie."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "Yeah, let me ask on that point."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "It's been the case to this point that kind of even if the research happens inside Google or Facebook, inside companies, it still kind of comes out, ideas come out."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Do you think that will always be the case with AI?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Is it possible to bottle ideas to the point where there's a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered by the general research community?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Do you think that's even possible?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "It's possible, but it's unlikely."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "It's not how it is done now."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "It's not how I can foresee it in the foreseeable future."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "But of course, I don't have a crystal ball and science is a crystal ball."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And so who knows?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "This is science fiction after all."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "I think it's ominous that the lights went off during that discussion."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "So the problem, again, there's one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds of science fiction."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "The problem for me, maybe similar to the question about existential risk, is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science and how it's going on that it can have unfortunate effects on people's understanding of current science."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And so that's kind of sad."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "There's an important principle in research, which is diversity."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So in other words, research is exploration."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Research is exploration in the space of ideas."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And different people will focus on different directions."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And this is not just good, it's essential."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So I'm totally fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to mine."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "I am more than fine."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "I think it's important."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "I and my friends don't claim we have universal truth about what will, especially about what will happen in the future."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Now that being said, we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "We should have those debates and not end up in a society where there's only one voice and one way of thinking and research money is spread out."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So disagreement is a sign of good research, good science."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "The idea of bias in the human sense of bias."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "How do you think about instilling in machine learning something that's aligned with human values in terms of bias?"}, {"time": 1688, "text": "We intuitively as human beings have a concept of what bias means, of what fundamental respect for other human beings means."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "But how do we instill that into machine learning systems, do you think?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So I think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long term things that we need to do."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "In the short term, there are techniques that have been proposed and I think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take data sets in which we know there is bias, we can measure it."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Pretty much any data set where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias, discrimination against particular groups and so on."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors, classifiers that are going to be less biased."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "We can do it, for example, using adversarial methods to make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "So these are clear, well defined ways of trying to address the problem."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Maybe they have weaknesses and more research is needed and so on."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "But I think in fact they are sufficiently mature that governments should start regulating companies where it matters, say like insurance companies, so that they use those techniques."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Because those techniques will probably reduce the bias but at a cost."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "For example, maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies will not do it until you force them."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "All right, so this is short term."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "Long term, I'm really interested in thinking how we can instill moral values into computers."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Obviously, this is not something we'll achieve in the next five or 10 years."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "How can we, you know, there's already work in detecting emotions, for example, in images, in sounds, in texts, and also studying how different agents interacting in different ways may correspond to patterns of, say, injustice, which could trigger anger."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model, for example, how humans react emotionally."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "I would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "This is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "I think it's quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can detect these kinds of things to the extent, unfortunately, that they understand enough about the world around us, which is a long time away."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "But maybe we can initially do this in virtual environments."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "I think we could train machines to detect those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was playing one of the characters."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "You have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "But there's been a lot of success on the supervised learning side."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "And one of the things I'm really passionate about is how humans and robots work together."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And in the context of supervised learning, that means the process of annotation."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Do you think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching machines?"}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Is there?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "I think it's an important subject."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody building a system tomorrow."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "But longer term, the process of teaching, I think, is something that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So there are people who have coined the term machine teaching."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So what are good strategies for teaching a learning agent?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "And can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher?"}, {"time": 1953, "text": "So in my group, we have a project called BBI or BBI game, where there is a game or scenario where there's a learning agent and a teaching agent."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Presumably, the teaching agent would eventually be a human."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "But we're not there yet."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And the role of the teacher is to use its knowledge of the environment, which it can acquire using whatever way brute force to help the learner learn as quickly as possible."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "So the learner is going to try to learn by itself, maybe using some exploration and whatever."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "But the teacher can choose, can have an influence on the interaction with the learner, so as to guide the learner, maybe teach it the things that the learner has most trouble with, or just add the boundary between what it knows and doesn't know, and so on."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So there's a tradition of these kind of ideas from other fields and like tutorial systems, for example, and AI."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "And of course, people in the humanities have been thinking about these questions."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "But I think it's time that machine learning people look at this, because in the future, we'll have more and more human machine interaction with the human in the loop."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And I think understanding how to make this work better, all the problems around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "You've done a lot of work with language, too."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "What aspect of the traditionally formulated Turing test, a test of natural language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "What in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "So I would say it's everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge, which implicitly you need in order to make sense of sentences, things like the Winograd schema."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So these sentences that are semantically ambiguous."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "In other words, you need to understand enough about the world in order to really interpret properly those sentences."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "I think these are interesting challenges for machine learning, because they point in the direction of building systems that both understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that knowledge with how to express it in language, either for reading or writing."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "You

thinking of ideas where you're completely, so this is an unique entity, uh, operating under selective pressures and it changes."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Uh, so that's a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 985, "text": "Well, terrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Whatever I suggest these things, I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will bring them into being by talking about them."}, {"time": 997, "text": "So, uh, there's this thing from open AI, uh, next, next week to talk to the founder of open AI, uh, this idea that, uh, their

speed."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So whether or not we're proponents or it doesn't, it doesn't really, it may not matter, but I, well, I do feel that there are people who've held things back and, uh,

playing with when we are working on technical problems."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called the bridge over the bridge on the river Kwai

the unrestricted open discussion of ideas and AI."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I could make a decent case for either our need to talk about this

is small enough that we should in fact be talking about how to contain them."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Well the way ideas, the way innovation happens, what new ideas develop, Newton with calculus, whether if he was silent, the idea would be, would emerge elsewhere in the case of Newton of course."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "But in the case of AI, how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would arise?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Well the idea is that the researchers we know and those that we don't know who may live in countries that don't wish us to know what level they're currently at are very disciplined in keeping these things to themselves."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Of course I will point out that there's a religious school in Kerala that developed something very close to the calculus, certainly in terms of infinite series in I guess religious prayer and rhyme and prose."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "So it's not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don't really believe that we have an ability to hold it back."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects of what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able to contain things later."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "So on the idea of intelligence, what form, treading cautiously as

We can't stop ourselves, can we?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "We cannot."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "What form do you see it taking?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "So one example, Facebook, Google, do want to, I don't know a better word, you want to influence users to behave a certain way and so that's one kind of example of how intelligence is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kinds."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "But do you see other examples of this actually emerging in... Just take any parasitic system, make sure that there's some way in which that there's differential success, heritability, and variation."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "And those are the magic ingredients and if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine, make sure that the system that expresses the variability has a spanning set so that it can learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "That's your nightmare."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So it's your nightmare, but it could also be, it's a really powerful mechanism by which to create, well, powerful systems."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So are you more worried about the negative direction that might go versus the positive?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So you said parasitic, but that doesn't necessarily need to be what the system converges towards."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "It could be, what is it?"}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And the dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not

prior model of what the vehicle was going to encounter."}, {"time": 421, "text": "And so that innovation that the fact that we could get decimeter resolution models was really a big deal."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And that allowed us to kind of bound the complexity of the driving problem the vehicle had and allowed it to operate at speed because we could assume things about the environment that it was going to encounter."}, {"time": 445, "text": "So that was the big step there."}, {"time": 451, "text": "For the Urban Challenge, one of the big technological innovations there was the multi beam LIDAR and being able to generate high resolution, mid to long range 3D models of the world and use that for understanding the world around the vehicle."}, {"time": 473, "text": "And that was really kind of a game changing technology."}, {"time": 478, "text": "In parallel with that, we saw a bunch of other technologies that had been kind of converging half their day in the sun."}, {"time": 488, "text": "So Bayesian estimation had been, SLAM had been a big field in robotics."}, {"time": 497, "text": "You would go to a conference a couple of years before that and every paper would effectively have SLAM somewhere in it."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And so seeing that the Bayesian estimation techniques play out on a very visible stage, I thought that was pretty exciting to see."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And mostly SLAM was done based on LIDAR at that time."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Yeah, and in fact, we weren't really doing SLAM per se in real time because we had a model ahead of time, we had a roadmap, but we were doing localization."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And we were using the LIDAR or the cameras depending on who exactly was doing it to localize to a model of the world."}, {"time": 537, "text": "And I thought that was a big step from kind of naively trusting GPS, INS before that."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And again, lots of work had been going on in this field."}, {"time": 549, "text": "Certainly this was not doing anything particularly innovative in SLAM or in localization, but it was seeing that technology necessary in a real application on a big stage, I thought was very cool."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So for the urban challenge, those are already maps constructed offline in general."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And did people do that individually, did individual teams do it individually so they had their own different approaches there or did everybody kind of share that information at least intuitively?"}, {"time": 582, "text": "So DARPA gave all the teams a model of the world, a map."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And then one of the things that we had to figure out back then was, and it's still one of these things that trips people up today is actually the coordinate system."}, {"time": 600, "text": "So you get a latitude longitude and to so many decimal places, you don't really care about kind of the ellipsoid of the earth that's being used."}, {"time": 609, "text": "But when you want to get to 10 centimeter or centimeter resolution, you care whether the coordinate system is NADS 83 or WGS 84 or these are different ways to describe both the kind of non sphericalness of the earth, but also kind of the, I think, I can't remember which one, the tectonic shifts that are happening and how to transform the global datum as a function of that."}, {"time": 637, "text": "So getting a map and then actually matching it to reality to centimeter resolution, that was kind of interesting and fun back then."}, {"time": 644, "text": "So how much work was the perception doing there?"}, {"time": 646, "text": "So how much were you relying on localization based on maps without using perception to register to the maps?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "And I guess the question is how advanced was perception at that point?"}, {"time": 659, "text": "It's certainly behind where we are today, right?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "We're more than a decade since the urban challenge."}, {"time": 665, "text": "But the core of it was there."}, {"time": 668, "text": "That we were tracking vehicles."}, {"time": 673, "text": "We had to do that at 100 plus meter range because we had to merge with other traffic."}, {"time": 678, "text": "We were using, again, Bayesian estimates for state of these vehicles."}, {"time": 683, "text": "We had to deal with a bunch of the problems that you think of today, of predicting where that vehicle's going to be a few seconds into the future."}, {"time": 691, "text": "We had to deal with the fact that there were multiple hypotheses for that because a vehicle at an intersection might be going right or it might be going straight or it might be making a left turn."}, {"time": 701, "text": "And we had to deal with the challenge of the fact that our behavior was going to impact the behavior of that other operator."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And we did a lot of that in relatively naive ways, but it kind of worked."}, {"time": 714, "text": "Still had to have some kind of solution."}, {"time": 717, "text": "And so where does that, 10 years later, where does that take us today from that artificial city construction to real cities to the urban environment?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "Yeah, I think the biggest thing is that the actors are truly unpredictable."}, {"time": 735, "text": "That most of the time, the drivers on the road, the other road users are out there behaving well, but every once in a while they're not."}, {"time": 747, "text": "The variety of other vehicles is, you have all of them."}, {"time": 752, "text": "In terms of behavior, in terms of perception, or both?"}, {"time": 758, "text": "Back then we didn't have to deal with cyclists, we didn't have to deal with pedestrians, didn't have to deal with traffic lights."}, {"time": 766, "text": "The scale over which that you have to operate is now is much larger than the air base that we were thinking about back then."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So what, easy question, what do you think is the hardest part about driving?"}, {"time": 779, "text": "Easy question."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Yeah, no, I'm joking."}, {"time": 782, "text": "I'm sure nothing really jumps out at you as one thing, but in the jump from the urban challenge to the real world, is there something that's a particular, you foresee as very serious, difficult challenge?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "I think the most fundamental difference is that we're doing it for real."}, {"time": 806, "text": "That in that environment, it was both a limited complexity environment because certain actors weren't there, because the roads were maintained, there were barriers keeping people separate from robots at the time, and it only had to work for 60 miles."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Which, looking at it from 2006, it had to work for 60 miles, right?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "Looking at it from now, we want things that will go and drive for half a million miles, and it's just a different game."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So how important, you said LiDAR came into the game early on, and it's really the primary driver of autonomous vehicles today as a sensor."}, {"time": 850, "text": "So how important is the role of LiDAR in the sensor suite in the near term?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "So I think it's essential."}, {"time": 857, "text": "I believe, but I also believe that cameras are essential, and I believe the radar is essential."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I think that you really need to use the composition of data from these different sensors if you want the thing to really be robust."}, {"time": 872, "text": "The question I wanna ask, let's see if we can untangle it, is what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk provocative statement that LiDAR is a crutch, that it's a kind of, I guess, growing pains, and that much of the perception task can be done with cameras?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "So I think it is undeniable that people walk around without lasers in their foreheads, and they can get into vehicles and drive them, and so there's an existence proof that you can drive using passive vision."}, {"time": 910, "text": "No doubt, can't argue with that."}, {"time": 912, "text": "In terms of sensors, yeah, so there's proof."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Yeah, in terms of sensors, right?"}, {"time": 916, "text": "So there's an example that we all go do it, many of us every day."}, {"time": 921, "text": "In terms of LiDAR being a crutch, sure."}, {"time": 965, "text": "And so any technology that we can bring to bear that accelerates this self driving technology coming to market and saving lives is technology we should be using."}, {"time": 978, "text": "And it feels just arbitrary to say, well, I'm not okay with using lasers because that's whatever, but I am okay with using an eight megapixel camera or a 16 megapixel camera."}, {"time": 992, "text": "These are just bits of technology, and we should be taking the best technology from the tool bin that allows us to go and solve a problem."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "The question I often talk to, well, obviously you do as well, to sort of automotive companies, and if there's one word that comes up more often than anything, it's cost, and trying to drive costs down."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So while it's true that it's a tragic number, the 37,000, the question is, and I'm not the one asking this question because I hate this question, but we want to find the cheapest sensor suite that creates a safe vehicle."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "So in that uncomfortable trade off, do you foresee LiDAR coming down in cost in the future, or do you see a day where level four autonomy is possible without LiDAR?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I see both of those, but it's really a matter of time."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "And I think really, maybe I would talk to the question you asked about the cheapest sensor."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I don't think that's actually what you want."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "What you want is a sensor suite that is economically viable."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And then after that, everything is about margin and driving costs out of the system."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "What you also want is a sensor suite that works."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And so it's great to tell a story about how it would be better to have a self driving system with a $50 sensor instead of a $500 sensor."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "But if the $500 sensor makes it work and the $50 sensor doesn't work, who cares?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "So long as you can actually have an economic opportunity, there's an economic opportunity there."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And the economic opportunity is important because that's how you actually have a sustainable business and that's how you can actually see this come to scale and be out in the world."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And so when I look at LiDAR, I see a technology that has no underlying fundamentally expense to it, fundamental expense to it."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "It's going to be more expensive than an imager because CMOS processes or FAP processes are dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "But we still should be able to drive costs down substantially on that side."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And then I also do think that with the right business model you can absorb more, certainly more cost on the bill of materials."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Yeah, if the sensor suite works, extra value is provided, thereby you don't need to drive costs down to zero."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "It's the basic economics."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "You've talked about your intuition that level two autonomy is problematic because of the human factor of vigilance, decrement, complacency, over trust and so on, just us being human."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "We over trust the system, we start doing even more so partaking in the secondary activities like smartphones and so on."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Have your views evolved on this point in either direction?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Can you speak to it?"}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So, and I want to be really careful because sometimes this gets twisted in a way that I certainly didn't intend."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So active safety systems are a really important technology that we should be pursuing and integrating into vehicles."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And there's an opportunity in the near term to reduce accidents, reduce fatalities, and we should be pushing on that."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "Level two systems are systems where the vehicle is controlling two axes."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "So braking and throttle slash steering."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And I think there are variants of level two systems that are supporting the driver."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "That absolutely we should encourage to be out there."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Where I think there's a real challenge is in the human factors part around this and the misconception from the public around the capability set that that enables and the trust that they should have in it."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And that is where I kind of, I'm actually incrementally more concerned around level three systems and how exactly a level two system is marketed and delivered and how much effort people have put into those human factors."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So I still believe several things around this."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "One is people will overtrust the technology."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "We've seen over the last few weeks a spate of people sleeping in their Tesla."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "I watched an episode last night of Trevor Noah talking about this and him, this is a smart guy who has a lot of resources at his disposal describing a Tesla as a self driving car and that why shouldn't people be sleeping in their Tesla?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And it's like, well, because it's not a self driving car and it is not intended to be and these people will almost certainly die at some point or hurt other people."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And so we need to really be thoughtful about how that technology is described and brought to market."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "I also think that because of the economic challenges we were just talking about, that these level two driver assistance systems, that technology path will diverge from the technology path that we need to be on to actually deliver truly self driving vehicles, ones where you can get in it and drive it."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Can get in it and sleep and have the equivalent or better safety than a human driver behind the wheel."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Because again, the economics are very different in those two worlds and so that leads to divergent technology."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So you just don't see the economics of gradually increasing from level two and doing so quickly enough to where it doesn't cause safety, critical safety concerns."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "You believe that it needs to diverge at this point into basically different routes."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And really that comes back to what are those L2 and L1 systems doing?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And they are driver assistance functions where the people that are marketing that responsibly are being very clear and putting human factors in place such that the driver is actually responsible for the vehicle and that the technology is there to support the driver."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And the safety cases that are built around those are dependent on that driver attention and attentiveness."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And at that point, you can kind of give up to some degree for economic reasons, you can give up on say false negatives."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And the way to think about this is for a four collision mitigation braking system, if it half the times the driver missed a vehicle in front of it, it hit the brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop, that would be an incredible, incredible advance in safety on our roads, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "That would be equivalent to seat belts."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But it would mean that if that vehicle wasn't being monitored, it would hit one out of two cars."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "And so economically, that's a perfectly good solution for a driver assistance system."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "What you should do at that point, if you can get it to work 50% of the time, is drive the cost out of that so you can get it on as many vehicles as possible."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "But driving the cost out of it doesn't drive up performance on the false negative case."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And so you'll continue to not have a technology that could really be available for a self driven vehicle."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So clearly the communication, and this probably applies to all four vehicles as well, the marketing and communication of what the technology is actually capable of, how hard it is, how easy it is, all that kind of stuff is highly problematic."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "So say everybody in the world was perfectly communicated and were made to be completely aware of every single technology out there, what it's able to do."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And now we're maybe getting into philosophical ground."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Is it possible to have a level two vehicle where we don't over trust it?"}, {"time": 1505, "text": "If people truly understood the risks and internalized it, then sure, you could do that safely."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But that's a world that doesn't exist."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "The people are going to, if the facts are put in front of them, they're gonna then combine that with their experience."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And let's say they're using an L2 system and they go up and down the 101 every day and they do that for a month."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And it just worked every day for a month."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Like that's pretty compelling at that point, just even if you know the statistics, you're like, well, I don't know, maybe there's something funny about those."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Maybe they're driving in difficult places."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "Like I've seen it with my own eyes, it works."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And the problem is that that sample size that they have, so it's 30 miles up and down, so 60 miles times 30 days, so 60, 180, 1,800 miles."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "Like that's a drop in the bucket compared to the, what, 85 million miles between fatalities."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And so they don't really have a true estimate based on their personal experience of the real risks, but they're gonna trust it anyway, because it's hard not to."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "It worked for a month, what's gonna change?"}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So even if you start a perfect understanding of the system, your own experience will make it drift."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I mean, that's a big concern."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Over a year, over two years even, it doesn't have to be months."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And I think that as this technology moves from what I would say is kind of the more technology savvy ownership group to the mass market, you may be able to have some of those folks who are really familiar with technology, they may be able to internalize it better."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "And your kind of immunization against this kind of false risk assessment might last longer, but as folks who aren't as savvy about that read the material and they compare that to their personal experience, I think there it's going to move more quickly."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So your work, the program that you've created at Google and now at Aurora is focused more on the second path of creating full autonomy."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So it's such a fascinating, I think it's one of the most interesting AI problems of the century, right?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "It's, I just talked to a lot of people, just regular people, I don't know, my mom, about autonomous vehicles, and you begin to grapple with ideas of giving your life control over to a machine."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "It's philosophically interesting, it's practically interesting."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "So let's talk about safety."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "How do you think we demonstrate, you've spoken about metrics in the past, how do you think we demonstrate to the world that an autonomous vehicle, an Aurora system is safe?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "This is one where it's difficult because there isn't a soundbite answer."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "That we have to show a combination of work that was done diligently and thoughtfully, and this is where something like a functional safety process is part of that."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "It's like here's the way we did the work, that means that we were very thorough."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So if you believe that what we said about this is the way we did it, then you can have some confidence that we were thorough in the engineering work we put into the system."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "That means you work with people that are essentially experts at safety to try to discuss and show."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "Do you think, the answer's probably no, but just in case, do you think there exists a metric?"}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So currently people have been using number of disengagements."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "And it quickly turns into a marketing scheme to sort of you alter the experiments you run to adjust."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "I think you've spoken that you don't like."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Don't love it."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "No, in fact, I was on the record telling DMV that I thought this was not a great metric."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Do you think it's possible to create a metric, a number that could demonstrate safety outside of fatalities?"}, {"time": 1812, "text": "So I do."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And I think that it won't be just one number."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So as we are internally grappling with this, and at some point we'll be able to talk more publicly about it, is how do we think about human performance in different tasks, say detecting traffic lights or safely making a left turn across traffic?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And what do we think the failure rates are for those different capabilities for people?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "And then demonstrating to ourselves and then ultimately folks in the regulatory role and then ultimately the public that we have confidence that our system will work better than that."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And so these individual metrics will kind of tell a compelling story ultimately."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "I do think at the end of the day what we care about in terms of safety is life saved and injuries reduced."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "And then ultimately kind of casualty dollars that people aren't having to pay to get their car fixed."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "And I do think that in aviation they look at a kind of an event pyramid where a crash is at the top of that and that's the worst event obviously and then there's injuries and near miss events and whatnot and violation of operating procedures and you kind of build a statistical model of the relevance of the low severity things or the high severity things."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And I think that's something where we'll be able to look at as well because an event per 85 million miles is statistically a difficult thing even at the scale of the U.S. to kind of compare directly."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And that event fatality that's connected to an autonomous vehicle is significantly at least currently magnified in the amount of attention it gets."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So that speaks to public perception."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "I think the most popular topic about autonomous vehicles in the public is the trolley problem formulation, right?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Which has, let's not get into that too much but is misguided in many ways."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "But it speaks to the fact that people are grappling with this idea of giving control over to a machine."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So how do you win the hearts and minds of the people that autonomy is something that could be a part of their lives?"}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I think you let them experience it, right?"}, {"time": 1967, "text": "I think it's right."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "I think people should be skeptical."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "I think people should ask questions."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "I think they should doubt because this is something new and different."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "They haven't touched it yet."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And I think that's perfectly reasonable."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "And, but at the same time, it's clear there's an opportunity to make the road safer."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It's clear that we can improve access to mobility."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "It's clear that we can reduce the cost of mobility."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And that once people try that and understand that it's safe and are able to use in their daily lives, I think it's one of these things that will just be obvious."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And I've seen this practically in demonstrations that I've given where I've had people come in and they're very skeptical."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Again, in a vehicle, my favorite one is taking somebody out on the freeway and we're on the 101 driving at 65 miles an hour."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "And after 10 minutes, they kind of turn and ask, is that all it does?"}, {"time": 2029, "text": "And you're like, it's a self driving car."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "I'm not sure exactly what you thought it would do, right?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "But it becomes mundane, which is exactly what you want a technology like this to be, right?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "We don't really, when I turn the light switch on in here, I don't think about the complexity of those electrons being pushed down a wire from wherever it was and being generated."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "It's like, I just get annoyed if it doesn't work, right?"}, {"time": 2059,

2066, "text": "I can not be afraid of the dark."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "And I think that's what we want this technology to be like is it's in the background and people get to have those life experiences and do so safely."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So putting this technology in the hands of people speaks to scale of deployment, right?"}, {"time": 2086, "text": "So what do you think the dreaded question about the future because nobody can predict the future, but just maybe speak poetically about when do you think we'll see a large scale deployment of autonomous vehicles, 10,000,

humans to get to all the videos of YouTube."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So there's no world in which you have only one or the other of these things."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And just as you said, a lot of it comes down to people at YouTube spending a lot of time trying to figure out what are the right policies, what are the outcomes based on those policies, are they the kinds of things we want to see?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And then once we kind of get an agreement or build some consensus around what the policies are, well, then we've got to find a way to implement those policies across all of YouTube."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And that's where both the human beings, we call them evaluators or reviewers, come into play to help us with that."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And then once we get a lot of training data from them, then we apply the machine learning techniques to take it even further."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "Do you have a sense that these human beings have a bias in some kind of direction?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I mean, that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "We do sort of in autonomous vehicles and computer vision in general, a lot of annotation, and we rarely ask what bias do the annotators have."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Even in the sense that they're better at annotating certain things than others."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "For example, people are much better at, for example, at writing, they're much better at or much better at annotating segmentation at segmenting cars in a scene versus segmenting bushes or trees."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "There's specific mechanical reasons for that, but also because it's semantic gray area."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And just for a lot of reasons, people are just terrible at annotating trees."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Okay, so in the same kind of sense, do you think of, in terms of people reviewing videos or annotating the content of videos, is there some kind of bias that you're aware of or seek out in that human input?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Well, we take steps to try to overcome these kinds of biases or biases that we think would be problematic."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So for instance, like we ask people to have a bias towards scientific consensus."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "That's something that we instruct them to do."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "We ask them to have a bias towards demonstration of expertise or credibility or authoritativeness."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "But there are other biases that we want to make sure to try to remove."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And there's many techniques for doing this."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "One of them is you send the same thing to be reviewed to many people."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And so, that's one technique."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Another is that you make sure that the people that are doing these sorts of tasks, that these sorts of tasks are from different backgrounds and different areas of the United States or of the world."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But then, even with all of that, it's possible for certain kinds of what we would call unfair biases to creep into machine learning systems, primarily, as you said, because maybe the training data itself comes in in a biased way."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So, we also have worked very hard on improving the machine learning systems to remove and reduce unfair biases when it goes against or involves some protected class, for instance."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Thank you for exploring with me some of the more challenging things."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "I'm sure there's a few more that we'll jump back to."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "But let me jump into the fun part, which is maybe the basics of the quote, unquote, YouTube algorithm."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "What does the YouTube algorithm look at to make recommendation for what to watch next?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And it's from a machine learning perspective."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Or when you search for a particular term, how does it know what to show you next?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Because it seems to, at least for me, do an incredible job of both."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Well, that's kind of you to say."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "It didn't used to do a very good job, but it's gotten better over the years."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Even I observed that it's improved quite a bit."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Those are two different situations."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Like when you search for something, YouTube uses the best technology we can get from Google to make sure that the YouTube search system finds what someone's looking for."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And of course, the very first things that one thinks about is, okay, well, does the word occur in the title, for instance?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But there are much more sophisticated things where we're mostly trying to do some syntactic match or maybe a semantic match based on words that we can add to the document itself."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "For instance, maybe is this video watched a lot after this query?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "That's something that we can observe and then as a result, make sure that that document would be retrieved for that query."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Now, when you talk about what kind of videos would be recommended to watch next, that's something, again, we've been working on for many years and probably the first real attempt to do that well was to use collaborative filtering."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Can you describe what collaborative filtering is?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "It's just basically what we do is we observe which videos get watched close together by the same person."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And what's amazing about that is that it puts all the videos that are in the same language together, for instance, and we didn't even have to think about language."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "It just does it, right?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And it puts all the videos that are about sports together and it puts most of the music videos together and it puts all of these sorts of videos together just because that's sort of the way the people using YouTube behave."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So that already cleans up a lot of the problem."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "It takes care of the lowest hanging fruit, which happens to be a huge one of just managing these millions of videos."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I remember a few years ago I was talking to someone who was trying to propose that we do a research project concerning people who are bilingual, and this person was making this proposal based on the idea that YouTube could not possibly be good at recommending videos well to people who are bilingual."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "And so she was telling me about this and I said, well, can you give me an example of what problem do you think we have on YouTube with the recommendations?"}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And so she said, well, I'm a researcher in the US and when I'm looking for academic topics, I want to see them in English."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And so she searched for one, found a video, and then looked at the watch next suggestions and they were all in English."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And so she said, oh, I see."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "YouTube must think that I speak only English."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "And so she said, now I'm actually originally from Turkey and sometimes when I'm cooking, let's say I want to make some baklava, I really like to watch videos that are in Turkish."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And so she searched for a video about making the baklava and then selected it and it was in Turkish and the watch next recommendations were in Turkish."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And she just couldn't believe how this was possible and how is it that you know that I speak both these two languages and put all the videos together?"}, {"time": 1664, "text": "And it's just as a sort of an outcome of this related graph that's created through collaborative filtering."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "So for me, one of my huge interests is just human psychology, right?"}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And that's such a powerful platform on which to utilize human psychology to discover what people, individual people want to watch next."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But it's also be just fascinating to me."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "You know, I've, Google search has ability to look at your own history and I've done that before, just, just what I've searched three years for many, many years."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And it's fascinating picture of who I am actually."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And I don't think anyone's ever summarized."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "I personally would love that."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "A summary of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I didn't get a reply of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I think it reveals, I think it puts a mirror to me or to others."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "You know, that's actually quite revealing and interesting, you know, just the, maybe in the number of, it's a joke, but not really is the number of cat videos I've watched or videos of people falling, you know, stuff that's absurd, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "It's really interesting."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And of course it's really good for the machine learning aspect to, to show, to figure out what to show next."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "But it's interesting."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Have you just as a tangent played around with the idea of giving a map to people sort of, as opposed to just using this information to show what's next, showing them here are the clusters you've loved over the years kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Well, we do provide the history of all the videos that you've watched."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So you can definitely search through that and look through it and search through it to see what it is that you've been watching on YouTube."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "We have actually in various times experimented with this sort of cluster idea, finding ways to demonstrate or show people what topics they've been interested in or what clusters they've watched from."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It's interesting that you bring this up because in some sense, the way the recommendation system of YouTube sees a user is exactly as the history of all the videos they've watched on YouTube."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And so you can think of yourself or any user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA strand of all your videos, right?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "That sort of represents you, you can also think of it as maybe a vector in the space of all the videos on YouTube."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And so now once you think of it as a vector in the space of all the videos on YouTube, then you can start to say, okay, well, which other vectors are close to me and to my vector?"}, {"time": 1839, "text": "And that's one of the ways that we generate some diverse recommendations is because you're like, okay, well, these people seem to be close with respect to the videos they've watched on YouTube, but here's a topic or a video that one of them has watched and enjoyed, but the other one hasn't, that could be an opportunity to make a good recommendation."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "I got to tell you, I mean, I know I'm going to ask for things that are impossible, but I would love to cluster than human beings."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "I would love to know who has similar trajectories as me, because you probably would want to hang out, right?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "There's a social aspect there, like actually finding some of the most fascinating people I find on YouTube, but have like no followers and I start following them and they create incredible content and on that topic, I just love to ask, there's some videos that just blow my mind in terms of quality and depth and just in every regard are amazing videos and they have like 57 views, okay?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "How do you get videos of quality to be seen by many eyes?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So the measure of quality, is it just something, yeah, how do you know that something is good?"}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Well, I mean, I think it depends initially on what sort of video we're talking about."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So in the realm of, let's say you mentioned politics and news, in that realm, you know, quality news or quality journalism relies on having a journalism department, right?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Like you have to have actual journalists and fact checkers and people like that and so in that situation and in others, maybe science or in medicine, quality has a lot to do with the authoritativeness and the credibility and the expertise of the people who make the video."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Now, if you think about the other end of the spectrum, you know, what is the highest quality prank video or what is the highest quality Minecraft video, right?"}, {"time": 1969, "text": "That might be the one that people enjoy watching the most and watch to the end or it might be the one that when we ask people the next day after they watched it, were they satisfied with it?"}, {"time": 1984, "text": "And so we in, especially in the realm of entertainment, have been trying to get at better and better measures of quality or satisfaction or enrichment since I came to YouTube."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And we started with, well, you know, the first approximation is the one that gets more views."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "But you know, we both know that things can get a lot of views and not really be that high quality, especially if people are clicking on something and then immediately realizing that it's not that great and abandoning it."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And that's why we moved from views to thinking about the amount of time people spend watching it with the premise that like, you know, in some sense, the time that someone spends watching a video is related to the value that they get from that video."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "It may not be perfectly related, but it has something to say about how much value they get."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "But even that's not good enough, right?"}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Because I myself have spent time clicking through channels on television late at night and ended up watching Under Siege 2 for some reason I don't know."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And if you were to ask me the next day, are you glad that you watched that show on TV last night?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "I'd say, yeah, I wish I would have gone to bed or read a book or almost anything else, really."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And so that's why some people got the idea a few years ago to try to survey users afterwards."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "And so we get feedback data from those surveys and then use that in the machine learning system to try to not just predict what you're going to click on right now, what you might watch for a while, but what when we ask you tomorrow, you'll give four or five stars to."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "So just to summarize, what are the signals from a machine learning perspective that a user can provide?"}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So you mentioned just clicking on the video views, the time watched, maybe the relative time watched, the clicking like and dislike on the video, maybe commenting on the video."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And then the one I wasn't actually quite aware of, even though I might have engaged in it is a survey afterwards, which is a brilliant idea."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Is there other signals?"}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I mean, that's already a really rich space of signals to learn from."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "Is there something else?"}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Well, you mentioned commenting, also sharing the video."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "If you think it's worthy to be shared with someone else you know."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Within YouTube or outside of YouTube as well?"}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Let's see, you mentioned like, dislike."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Like and dislike."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "How important is that?"}, {"time": 2147, "text": "It's very important, right?"}, {"time": 2148, "text": "We want, it's predictive of satisfaction."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "But it's not perfectly predictive."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Subscribe."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "If you subscribe to the channel of the person who made the video, then that also is a piece of information and it signals satisfaction."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Although over the years, we've learned that people have a wide range of attitudes about what it means to subscribe."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "We would ask some users who didn't subscribe very much, but they watched a lot from a few channels."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "We'd say, well, why didn't you subscribe?"}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And they would say, well, I can't afford to pay for anything."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "We tried to let them understand like, actually it doesn't cost anything."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "It just helps us know that you are very interested in this creator."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "But then we've asked other people who subscribe to many things and don't really watch any of the videos from those channels."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "And we say, well, why did you subscribe to this if you weren't really interested in any more videos from that channel?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And they might tell us, well, I just, you know, I thought the person did a great job and I just want to kind of give them a high five."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "That's where I sit."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "I go to channels where I just, this person is amazing."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "I like this person."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "But then I like this person and I really want to support them."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "That's how I click subscribe."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "Even though I mean never actually want to click on their videos when they're releasing it."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "I just love what they're doing."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "And it's maybe outside of my interest area and so on, which is probably the wrong way to use the subscribe button."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "But I just want to say congrats."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "This is great work."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "Well, so you have to deal with all the space of people that see the subscribe button is totally different."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And so, you know, we can't just close our eyes and say, sorry, you're using it wrong."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "You know, we're not going to pay attention to what you've done."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "We need to embrace all the ways in which all the different people in the world use the subscribe button or the like and the dislike button."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So in terms of signals of machine learning, using for the search and for the recommendation, you've mentioned title."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So like metadata, like text data that people provide description and title and maybe keywords."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "Maybe you can speak to the value of those things in search and also this incredible fascinating area of the content itself."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So the video content itself, trying to understand what's happening in the video."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So YouTube released a data set that, you know, in the machine learning computer vision world, this is just an exciting space."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "How much is that currently?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "How much are you playing with that currently?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "How much is your hope for the future of being able to analyze the content of the video itself?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "Well, we have been working on that also since I came to YouTube."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Analyzing the content."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Analyzing the content of the video, right?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And what I can tell you is that our ability to do it well is still somewhat crude."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "We can tell if it's a music video, we can tell if it's a sports video, we can probably tell you that people are playing soccer."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "We probably can't tell whether it's Manchester United or my daughter's soccer team."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "So these things are kind of difficult and using them, we can use them in some ways."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So for instance, we use that kind of information to understand and inform these clusters that I talked about."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And also maybe to add some words like soccer, for instance, to the video, if it doesn't occur in the title or the description, which is remarkable that often it doesn't."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "One of the things that I ask creators to do is please help us out with the title and the description."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "For instance, we were a few years ago having a live stream of some competition for World of Warcraft on YouTube."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And it was a very important competition, but if you typed World of Warcraft in search, you wouldn't find it."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "World of Warcraft wasn't in the title?"}, {"time": 2407, "text": "World of Warcraft wasn't in the title."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "It was match 478, you know, A team versus B team and World of Warcraft wasn't in the title."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "I'm just like, come on, give me."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "Being literal on the internet is actually very uncool, which is the problem."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "Oh, is that right?"}, {"time": 2423, "text": "Well, I mean, in some sense, well, some of the greatest videos, I mean, there's a humor to just being indirect, being witty and so on."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "And actually being, you know, machine learning algorithms want you to be, you know, literal, right?"}, {"time": 2438, "text": "You just want to say what's in the thing, be very, very simple."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And in some sense that gets away from wit and humor."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "So you have to play with both, right?"}, {"time": 2448, "text": "But you're saying that for now, sort of the content of the title, the content of the description, the actual text is one of the best ways for the algorithm to find your video and put them in the right cluster."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And I would go further and say that if you want people, human beings to select your video in search, then it helps to have, let's say World of Warcraft in the title."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Because why would a person, you know, if they're looking at a bunch, they type World of Warcraft and they have a bunch of videos, all of whom say World of Warcraft, except the one that you uploaded."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "Well, even the person is going to think, well, maybe this isn't somehow search made a mistake."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "This isn't really about World of Warcraft."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So it's important not just for the machine learning systems, but also for the people who might be looking for this sort of thing."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "They get a clue that it's what they're looking for by seeing that same thing prominently in the title of the video."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "Let me push back on that."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "So I think from the algorithm perspective, yes, but if they typed in World of Warcraft and saw a video that with the title simply winning and the thumbnail has like a sad orc or something, I don't know, right?"}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Like I think that's much, it gets your curiosity up."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "And then if they could trust that the algorithm was smart enough to figure out somehow that this is indeed a World of Warcraft video, that would have created the most beautiful experience."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "I think in terms of just the wit and the humor and the curiosity that we human beings naturally have."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "But you're saying, I mean, realistically speaking, it's really hard for the algorithm to figure out that the content of that video will be a World of Warcraft video."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And you have to accept that some people are going to skip it."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I mean, and so you're right."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "The people who don't skip it and select it are going to be delighted, but other people might say, yeah, this is not what I was looking for."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "And making stuff discoverable, I think is what you're really working on and hoping."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "So from your perspective, put stuff in the title description."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "And remember the collaborative filtering part of the system starts by the same user watching videos together, right?"}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So the way that they're probably going to do that is by searching for them."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "That's a fascinating aspect of it."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "It's like ant colonies."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "That's how they find stuff."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So I mean, what degree for collaborative filtering in general is one curious ant, one curious user, essential?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So just a person who is more willing to click on random videos and sort of explore these cluster spaces."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "In your sense, how many people are just like watching the same thing over and over and over and over?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "And how many are just like the explorers and just kind of like click on stuff and then help the other ant in the ant's colony discover the cool stuff?"}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Do you have a sense of that at all?"}, {"time": 2631, "text": "I really don't think I have a sense for the relative sizes of those groups."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "But I would say that people come to YouTube with some certain amount of intent."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And as long as they, to the extent to which they try to satisfy that intent, that certainly helps our systems, right?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Because our systems rely on kind of a faithful amount of behavior, right?"}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And there are people who try to trick us, right?"}, {"time": 2659, "text": "There are people and machines that try to associate videos together that really don't belong together, but they're trying to get that association made because it's profitable for them."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And so we have to always be resilient to that sort of attempt at gaming the systems."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "So speaking to that, there's a lot of people that in a positive way, perhaps, I don't know, I don't like it, but like to want to try to game the system to get more attention."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Everybody creators in a positive sense want to get attention, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "So how do you work in this space when people create more and more sort of click baity titles and thumbnails?"}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Sort of very to ask him, Derek has made a video where basically describes that it seems what works is to create a high quality video, really good video, where people would want to watch it once they click on it, but have click baity titles and thumbnails to get them to click on it in the first place."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "And he's saying, I'm embracing this fact, I'm just going to keep doing it."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "And I hope you forgive me for doing it and you will enjoy my videos once you click on them."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So in what sense do you see this kind of click bait style attempt to manipulate, to get people in the door to manipulate the algorithm or play with the algorithm or game the algorithm?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "I think that you can look at it as an attempt to game the algorithm."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "But even if you were to take the algorithm out of it and just say, okay, well, all these videos happen to be lined up, which the algorithm didn't make any decision about which one to put at the top or the bottom, but they're all lined up there, which one are the people going to choose?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I'll tell you the same thing that I told Derek is, I have a bookshelf and they have two kinds of books on them, science books."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "I have my math books from when I was a student and they all look identical except for the titles on the covers."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "They're all yellow, they're all from Springer and they're every single one of them."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "The cover is totally the same."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "On the other hand, I have other more pop science type books and they all have very interesting covers and they have provocative titles and things like that."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I wouldn't say that they're click baity because they are indeed good books."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And I don't think that they cross any line, but that's just a decision you have to make."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "Like the people who write classical recursion theory by Piero di Freddie, he was fine with the yellow title and nothing more."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "Whereas I think other people who wrote a more popular type book understand that they need to have a compelling cover and a compelling title."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And I don't think there's anything really wrong with that."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "We do take steps to make sure that there is a line that you don't cross."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "And if you go too far, maybe your thumbnail is especially racy or it's all caps with too many exclamation points, we observe that users are sometimes offended by that."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "And so for the users who are offended by that, we will then depress or suppress those videos."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And which reminds me, there's also another signal where users can say, I don't know if it was recently added, but I really enjoy it."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "Just saying, something like, I don't want to see this video anymore or something like, like this is a, like there's certain videos that just cut me the wrong way."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Like just, just jump out at me, it's like, I don't want to, I don't want this."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And it feels really good to clean that up, to be like, I don't, that's not, that's not for me."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "I think that might've been recently added, but that's also a really strong signal."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "We don't want to make a recommendation that people are unhappy with."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "And that makes me, that particular one makes me feel good as a user in general and as a machine learning person."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "Cause I feel like I'm helping the algorithm."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "My interactions on YouTube don't always feel like I'm helping the algorithm."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Like I'm not reminded of that fact."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "Like for example, Tesla and Autopilot and Elon Musk create a feeling for their customers, for people that own Teslas, that they're helping the algorithm of Tesla vehicles."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Like they're all, like are really proud they're helping the fleet learn."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "I think YouTube doesn't always remind people that you're helping the algorithm get smarter."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "And for me, I love that idea."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Like we're all collaboratively, like Wikipedia gives that sense that we're all together creating a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "YouTube is a, doesn't always remind me of that."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "It's a, this conversation is reminding me of that, but."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Well that's a good tip."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "We should keep that fact in mind when we design these features."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "I'm not sure I really thought about it that way, but that's a very interesting perspective."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "It's an interesting question of personalization that I feel like when I click like on a video, I'm just improving my experience."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "It would be great."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "It would make me personally, people are different, but make me feel great if I was helping also the YouTube algorithm broadly say something."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "You know what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Like there's a, that I don't know if that's human nature, but you want the products you love, and I certainly love YouTube, like you want to help it get smarter, smarter, smarter because there's some kind of coupling between our lives together being better."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "If YouTube is better than I will, my life will be better."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And there's that kind of reasoning."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "I'm not sure what that is and I'm not sure how many people share that feeling."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "That could be just a machine learning feeling."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "But on that point, how much personalization is there in terms of next video recommendations?"}, {"time": 3022, "text": "So is it kind of all really boiling down to clustering?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Like if I'm the nearest clusters to me and so on and that kind of thing, or how much is personalized to me, the individual completely?"}, {"time": 3036, "text": "It's very, very personalized."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "So your experience will be quite a bit different from anybody else's who's watching that same video, at least when they're logged in."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And the reason is that we found that users often want two different kinds of things when they're watching a video."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Sometimes they want to keep watching more on that topic or more in that genre."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "And other times they just are done and they're ready to move on to something else."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And so the question is, well, what is the something else?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "And one of the first things one can imagine is, well, maybe something else is the latest video from some channel to which you've subscribed."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And that's going to be very different for you than it is for me."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And even if it's not something that you subscribe to, it's something that you watch a lot."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And again, that'll be very different on a person by person basis."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And so even the Watch Next, as well as the homepage, of course, is quite personalized."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So what, we mentioned some of the signals, but what does success look like?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "What does success look like in terms of the algorithm creating a great long term experience for a user?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Or to put another way, if you look at the videos I've watched this month, how do you know the algorithm succeeded for me?"}, {"time": 3123, "text": "I think, first of all, if you come back and watch more YouTube, then that's one indication that you found some value from it."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "So just the number of hours is a powerful indicator."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Well, I mean, not the hours themselves, but the fact that you return on another day."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "So that's probably the most simple indicator."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "People don't come back to things that they don't find value in, right?"}, {"time": 3149, "text": "There's a lot of other things that they could do."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "But like I said, ideally, we would like everybody to feel that YouTube enriches their lives and that every video they watched is the best one they've ever watched since they've started watching YouTube."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "And so that's why we survey them and ask them, is this one to five stars?"}, {"time": 3172, "text": "And so our version of success is every time someone takes that survey, they say it's five stars."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And if we ask them, is this the best video you've ever seen on YouTube?"}, {"time": 3183, "text": "They say, yes, every single time."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "So it's hard to imagine that we would actually achieve that."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "Maybe asymptotically we would get there, but that would be what we think success is."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "I've recently said somewhere, I don't know, maybe tweeted, but that Ray Dalio has this video on the economic machine, I forget what it's called, but it's a 30 minute video."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "And I said it's the greatest video I've ever watched on YouTube."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "It's like I watched the whole thing and my mind was blown as a very crisp, clean description of how the, at least the American economic system works."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "It's a beautiful video."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And I was just, I wanted to click on something to say this is the best thing."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "This is the best thing ever."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Please let me, I can't believe I discovered it."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "I mean, the views and the likes reflect its quality, but I was almost upset that I haven't found it earlier and wanted to find other things like it."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "I don't think I've ever felt that this is the best video I've ever watched."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "That was that."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And to me, the ultimate utopia, the best experiences were every single video."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "Where I don't see any of the videos I regret and every single video I watch is one that actually helps me grow, helps me enjoy life, be happy and so on."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So that's a heck of a, that's one of the most beautiful and ambitious, I think, machine learning tasks."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "So when you look at a society as opposed to the individual user, do you think of how YouTube is changing society when you have these millions of people watching videos, growing, learning, changing, having debates?"}, {"time": 3285, "text": "Do you have a sense of, yeah, what the big impact on society is?"}, {"time": 3291, "text": "I think it's huge, but do you have a sense of what direction we're taking this world?"}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Well, I mean, I think openness has had an impact on society already."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "There's a lot of... What do you mean by openness?"}, {"time": 3305, "text": "Well, the fact that unlike other mediums, there's not someone sitting at YouTube who decides before you can upload your video, whether it's worth having you upload it or worth anybody seeing it really, right?"}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And so there are some creators who say, like, I wouldn't have this opportunity to reach an audience."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Tyler Oakley often said that he wouldn't have had this opportunity to reach this audience if it weren't for YouTube."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And so I think that's one way in which YouTube has changed society."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "I know that there are people that I work with from outside the United States, especially from places where literacy is low, and they think that YouTube can help in those places because you don't need to be able to read and write in order to learn something important for your life, maybe how to do some job or how to fix something."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And so that's another way in which I think YouTube is possibly changing society."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "So I've worked at YouTube for eight, almost nine years now."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "And it's fun because I meet people and you tell them where you work, you say you work on YouTube and they immediately say, I love YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "Which is great, makes me feel great."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "But then of course, when I ask them, well, what is it that you love about YouTube?"}, {"time": 3403, "text": "Not one time ever has anybody said that the search works outstanding or that the recommendations are great."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "What they always say when I ask them, what do you love about YouTube is they immediately start talking about some channel or some creator or some topic or some community that they found on YouTube and that they just love."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And so that has made me realize that YouTube is really about the video and connecting the people with the videos."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And then everything else kind of gets out of the way."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So beyond the video, it's an interesting, because you kind of mentioned creator."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "What about the connection with just the individual creators as opposed to just individual video?"}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So like I gave the example of Ray Dalio video that the video itself is incredible, but there's some people who are just creators that I love."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "One of the cool things about people who call themselves YouTubers or whatever is they have a journey."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "They usually, almost all of them, they suck horribly in the beginning and then they kind of grow and then there's that genuineness in their growth."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "So YouTube clearly wants to help creators connect with their audience in this kind of way."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "So how do you think about that process of helping creators grow, helping them connect with their audience, develop not just individual videos, but the entirety of a creator's life on YouTube?"}, {"time": 3498, "text": "Well, I mean, we're trying to help creators find the biggest audience that they can find."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And the reason why that's, you brought up creator versus video, the reason why creator channel is so important is because if we have a hope of people coming back to YouTube, well, they have to have in their minds some sense of what they're going to find when they come back to YouTube."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "If YouTube were just the next viral video and I have no concept of what the next viral video could be, one time it's a cat playing a piano and the next day it's some children interrupting a reporter and the next day it's some other thing happening, then it's hard for me to, when I'm not watching YouTube, say, gosh, I really would like to see something from someone or about something, right?"}, {"time": 3557, "text": "And so that's why I think this connection between fans and creators is so important for both, because it's a way of sort of fostering a relationship that can play out into the future."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Let me talk about kind of a dark and interesting question in general, and again, a topic that you or nobody has an answer to."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "But social media has a sense of, it gives us highs and it gives us lows in the sense that sort of creators often speak about having sort of burnout and having psychological ups and downs and challenges mentally in terms of continuing the creation process."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "There's a momentum, there's a huge excited audience that makes creators feel great."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "And I think it's more than just financial."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "I think it's literally just, they love that sense of community."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "It's part of the reason I upload to YouTube."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "I don't care about money, never will."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "What I care about is the community, but some people feel like this momentum, and even when there's times in their life when they don't feel, you know, for some reason don't feel like creating."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "So how do you think about burnout, this mental exhaustion that some YouTube creators go through?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Is that something we have an answer for?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Is that something, how do we even think about that?"}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Well, the first thing is we want to make sure that the YouTube systems are not contributing to this sense, right?"}, {"time": 3649, "text": "And so we've done a fair amount of research to demonstrate that you can absolutely take a break."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "If you are a creator and you've been uploading a lot, we have just as many examples of people who took a break and came back more popular than they were before as we have examples of going the other way."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "Can we pause on that for a second?"}, {"time": 3671, "text": "So the feeling that people have, I think, is if I take a break, everybody, the party will leave, right?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "So if you could just linger on that."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "So in your sense that taking a break is okay."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Yes, taking a break is absolutely okay."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "And the reason I say that is because we have, we can observe many examples of being, of creators coming back very strong and even stronger after they have taken some sort of break."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And so I just want to dispel the myth that this somehow necessarily means that your channel is going to go down or lose views."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "That is not the case."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "We know for sure that this is not a necessary outcome."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "And so we want to encourage people to make sure that they take care of themselves."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "That is job one, right?"}, {"time": 3726, "text": "You have to look after yourself and your mental health."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "And I think that it probably, in some of these cases, contributes to better videos once they come back, right?"}, {"time": 3740, "text": "Because a lot of people, I mean, I know myself, if I burn out on something, then I'm probably not doing my best work, even though I can keep working until I pass out."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "And so I think that the taking a break may even improve the creative ideas that someone has."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "I think that's a really important thing to sort of dispel."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "I think that applies to all of social media, like literally I've taken a break for a day every once in a while."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "Sorry if that sounds like a short time, but even like, sorry, email, just taking a break from email, or only checking email once a day, especially when you're going through something psychologically in your personal life or so on, or really not sleeping much because of work deadlines, it can refresh you in a way that's profound."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "And so the same applies."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "It was there when you came back, right?"}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And it looks different, actually, when you come back."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "You're sort of brighter eyed with some coffee, everything, the world looks better."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "So it's important to take a break when you need it."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So you've mentioned kind of the YouTube algorithm that isn't E equals MC squared, it's not the single equation, it's potentially sort of more than a million lines of code."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "Is it more akin to what successful autonomous vehicles today are, which is they're just basically patches on top of patches of heuristics and human experts really tuning the algorithm and have some machine learning modules?"}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Or is it becoming more and more a giant machine learning system with humans just doing a little bit of tweaking here and there?"}, {"time": 3847, "text": "First of all, do you even have a sense of what is the YouTube algorithm at this point?"}, {"time": 3851, "text": "And however much you do have a sense, what does it look like?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Well, we don't usually think about it as the algorithm because it's a bunch of systems that work on different services."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "The other thing that I think people don't understand is that what you might refer to as the YouTube algorithm from outside of YouTube is actually a bunch of code and machine learning systems and heuristics, but that's married with the behavior of all the people who come to YouTube every day."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So the people part of the code, essentially."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "If there were no people who came to YouTube tomorrow, then the algorithm wouldn't work anymore."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "That's the whole part of the algorithm."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And so when people talk about, well, the algorithm does this, the algorithm does that, it's sometimes hard to understand, well, it could be the viewers are doing that."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "And the algorithm is mostly just keeping track of what the viewers do and then reacting to those things in sort of more fine grain situations."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And I think that this is the way that the recommendation system and the search system and probably many machine learning systems evolve is you start trying to solve a problem and the first way to solve a problem is often with a simple heuristic."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "And you want to say, what are the videos we're going to recommend?"}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Well, how about the most popular ones?"}, {"time": 3939, "text": "That's where you start."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And over time, you collect some data and you refine your situation so that you're making less heuristics and you're building a system that can actually learn what to do in different situations based on some observations of those situations in the past."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "And you keep chipping away at these heuristics over time."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "And so I think that just like with diversity, I think the first diversity measure we took was, okay, not more than three videos in a row from the same channel."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "It's a pretty simple heuristic to encourage diversity, but it worked, right?"}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Who needs to see four, five, six videos in a row from the same channel?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "And over time, we try to chip away at that and make it more fine grain and basically have it remove the heuristics in favor of something that can react to individuals and individual situations."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "So how do you, you mentioned, you know, we know that something worked."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "How do you get a sense when decisions are kind of A, B testing that this idea was a good one, this was not so good?"}, {"time": 4015, "text": "How do you measure that and across which time scale, across how many users, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 4021, "text": "Well, you mentioned the A, B experiments."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "And so just about every single change we make to YouTube, we do it only after we've run a A, B experiment."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "And so in those experiments, which run from one week to months, we measure hundreds, literally hundreds of different variables and measure changes with confidence intervals in all of them, because we really are trying to get a sense for ultimately, does this improve the experience for viewers?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "That's the question we're trying to answer."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "And an experiment is one way because we can see certain things go up and down."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So for instance, if we noticed in the experiment, people are dismissing videos less frequently, or they're saying that they're more satisfied, they're giving more videos five stars after they watch them, then those would be indications that the experiment is successful, that it's improving the situation for viewers."}, {"time": 4088, "text": "But we can also look at other things, like we might do user studies, where we invite some people in and ask them, like, what do you think about this?"}, {"time": 4097, "text": "How do you feel about this?"}, {"time": 4099, "text": "And other various kinds of user research."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "But ultimately, before we launch something, we're going to want to run an experiment."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "So we get a sense for what the impact is going to be, not just to the viewers, but also to the different channels and all of that."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "An absurd question."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "Well, actually, it's interesting."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "Maybe there's an answer."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "But if I want to make a viral video, how do I do it?"}, {"time": 4125, "text": "I don't know how you make a viral video."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "I know that we have in the past tried to figure out if we could detect when a video was going to go viral."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And those were, you take the first and second derivatives of the view count and maybe use that to do some prediction."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "But I can't say we ever got very good at that."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "Oftentimes we look at where the traffic was coming from."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "If a lot of the viewership is coming from something like Twitter, then maybe it has a higher chance of becoming viral than if it were coming from search or something."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But that was just trying to detect a video that might be viral."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "How to make one, I have no idea."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "You get your kids to interrupt you while you're on the news or something."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "But after the fact, on one individual video, sort of ahead of time predicting is a really hard task."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "But after the video went viral, in analysis, can you sometimes understand why it went viral?"}, {"time": 4193,

the reason."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "If you think about, I mean, let's say the NBA is uploading videos of its games."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "Well, people might search for warriors versus rockets

video."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "And so I think that you never know how people are going to search for something that you've created."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And so you want to, I would say you want to make clips and add titles and things like that so that they can find it as easily as possible."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Do you have a dream of a future, perhaps a distant future when the

space of users that would find, you know, 30% of those topics really interesting."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And that space is very different."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "It's something that's beyond my ability to clip out, right?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "But the algorithm might be able to figure all that out, sort of expand into clips."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Do you have a, do you think about this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Do you have a hope or dream that one day the algorithm will be able to do that kind of deep content analysis?"}, {"time": 4550, "text": "Well, we've actually had projects that attempt to achieve this, but it really does depend on understanding the video well and our understanding of the video right now is quite crude."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And so I think it would be especially hard to do it with a conversation like this."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "One might be able to do it with, let's say a soccer match more easily, right?"}, {"time": 4578, "text": "You could probably find out where the goals were scored."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "And then of course you, you need to figure out who it was that scored the goal and, and that might require a human to do some annotation."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "But I think that trying to identify coherent topics in a transcript, like, like the one of our conversation is, is not something that we're going to be very good at right away."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "And I was speaking more to the general problem actually of being able to do both a soccer match and our conversation without explicit sort of almost my, my hope was that there exists an algorithm that's able to find exciting things in video."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So Google now on Google search will help you find the

frame."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "So he's confident this is the way to go."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "So for you, from the perspective of just working with this video, how do you think an algorithm

for the next frame there."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "So I don't know if I believe that just being able to predict the next frame is going to be enough because there's so many frames and even a tiny bit of error on a per frame basis can lead to wildly different videos."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "So the thing is, the idea of compression is one way to do compression is to describe through text what's contained in the video."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "That's the ultimate high level of compression."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "So the idea is traditionally when you think of video image compression, you're trying to maintain the same visual quality while reducing the size."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "But if you think of deep learning from a bigger perspective of what compression is, is you're trying to summarize the video."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "And the idea there is if you have a big enough neural network, just by watching the next, trying to predict the next frame, you'll be able to form a compression of actually understanding what's going on in the scene."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "If there's two people talking, you can just reduce that entire video into the fact that two people are talking and maybe the content of what they're saying and so on."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "That's kind of the open ended dream."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "So I just wanted to sort of

gets you there."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "But once you're there, I think when you, uh, summit a mountain, a really hard mountain, you inevitably get there."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "That's just a

something else with 23."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "And then I came back and started working for a businessman in Russia who built the first ROG network, um, in our country and was very visionary and asked me whether I want to do fun stuff together."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "Um, and we worked on a bank, um, the idea was to build a bank on top of, um, a telco."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "So that was 2011 or 12, um, and a lot of telecommunication company, um, mobile network operators didn't really know what to do next in terms of, you know, new products, new revenue."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And this big idea was that, you know, um, you put a bank on top and then all work works out."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Basically a prepaid account becomes your bank account and, um, you can use it as, as your bank."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "Uh, so, you know, a third of a country wakes up as, as your bank client."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Um, but we couldn't quite figure out what, what would be the main interface to interact with the bank."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "The problem was that most people didn't have smart, smart phones back in the time in Russia, the penetration of smartphones was low, um, people didn't use mobile banking or online banking and their computers."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "So we figured out that SMS would be the best way, uh, cause that would work on feature phones."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Um, but that required some chat bot technology, which I didn't know anything about, um, obviously."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So I started looking into it and saw that there's nothing really, well, there wasn't just nothing really."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Ideas through SMS be able to interact with your bank account."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "And then we thought, well, since you're talking to a bank account, why can't this, can't we use more of, uh, you know, some behavioral ideas and why can't this, uh, banking chat bot be nice to you and really talk to you sort of as a friend this way you develop more connection to it, retention is higher, people don't churn."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And so I went to very depressing, um, um, Russian cities to test it out."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Um, I went to, I remember three different towns with, uh, um, to interview potential users."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Um, so people use it for a little bit and I went to talk to them, um, very poor towns, mostly towns that were, um, you know, sort of factories, uh, mono towns."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "They were building something and then the factory went away and it was just a bunch of very poor people."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Um, and then we went to a couple that weren't as dramatic, but still the one I remember really fondly was this woman that worked at a glass factory and she talked to a chat bot."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Um, and she was talking about it and she started crying during the interview because she said, no one really cares for me that much."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And um, so to be clear, that was the, my only endeavor in programming that chat bot."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "So it was really simple."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "It was literally just a few, if this, then that rules and, um, it was incredibly simplistic."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "Um, and that really made her emotional and she said, you know, I only have my mom and my, um, my husband and I don't have any more really in my life."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And that was very sad, but at the same time I felt, and we had more interviews in a similar vein and what I thought in the moment was like, well, uh, it's not that the technology is ready because definitely in 2012 technology was not ready for, for that, but, um, humans are ready, unfortunately."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "So this project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more about human vulnerabilities, but, um, there's something so, so powerful around about conversational, um, AI that I saw then that I thought was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort into."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "So in the end of the day, we saw the banking project, um, but my then boss, um, was also my mentor and really, really close friend, um, told me, Hey, I think there's something in it and you should just go work on it."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And I was like, well, what product?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "I don't know what I'm building."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "He's like, you'll figure it out."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "And, um, you know, looking back at this, this was a horrible idea to work on something without knowing what it was, which is maybe the reason why it took us so long, but we just decided to work on the conversational tech to see what it, you know, there were no chat bot, um, constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually build one at the time."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Uh, that was the era of, by the way, Google glass, which is why, you know, some of the investors like seed investors we've talked with were like, Oh, you should totally build it for Google glass."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "If not, we're not, I don't think that's interesting."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "Did you bite on that idea?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Because I wanted to be, to do text first cause I'm a journalist."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So I was, um, fascinated by just texting."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "So you thought, so the emotional, um, that interaction that the woman had, like, so do you think you could feel emotion from just text?"}, {"time": 4571, "text": "I saw something in just this pure texting and also thought that we should first start, start building for people who really need it versus people who have Google glass."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "Uh, if you know what I mean, and I felt like the early adopters of Google glass might not be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need some, you know, someone to talk to."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "Um, but then we really just focused on the tech itself."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "We just thought, what if we just, you know, we didn't have a product idea in the moment and we felt, what if we just look into, um, building the best conversational constructors, so to say, use the best tech available at the time."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And that was before the first paper about deep learning applied to dialogues, which happened in 2015 in August, 2015, uh, which Google published."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "Did you follow the work of Lobna prize and like all the sort of non machine learning chat bots?"}, {"time": 4631, "text": "What really struck me was that, you know, there was a lot of talk about machine learning and deep learning."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Like big data was a really big thing."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Everyone was saying, you know, the business world, big data, 2012 is the biggest gaggle competitions were, you know, um, important, but that was really the kind of upheaval."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "People started talking about machine learning a lot, um, but it was only about images or something else."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "And it was never about conversation."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "As soon as I looked into the conversational tech, it was all about something really weird and very outdated and very marginal and felt very hobbyist."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "It was all about Lord burner price, which was won by a guy who built a chat bot that talked like a Ukrainian teenager that it was just a gimmick."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And somehow people picked up those gimmicks and then, you know, the most famous chat bot at the time was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre or smarter child on aim."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "The funny thing is it felt at the time not to be that popular and it still doesn't seem to be that popular."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Like people talk about the Turing test, people like talking about it philosophically, journalists like writing about it, but as a technical problem, like people don't seem to really want to solve the open dialogue."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "Like they, they're not obsessed with it."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "Even folks are like, you know, I'm in Boston, the Alexa team, even they're not as obsessed with it as I thought they might be."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "So you know what you felt like you felt with that woman who, when she felt something by reading the text, I feel the same thing."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "There's something here, what you felt."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "I feel like Alexa folks and just the machine learning world doesn't feel that, that there's something here because they see as a technical problem is not that interesting for some reason."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "It's could be argued that maybe as a purely sort of natural language processing problem, it's not the right problem to focus on because there's too much subjectivity."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "That thing that the woman felt like crying, like if your benchmark includes a woman crying, that doesn't feel like a good benchmark."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "But to me there's something there that's, you could have a huge impact, but I don't think the machine learning world likes that, the human emotion, the subjectivity of it, the fuzziness, the fact that with maybe a single word you can make somebody feel something deeply."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "It doesn't feel right to them."},

I'm giving myself props for Googling and for coming across, for I guess mutual friend and introducing us, but I'm so glad that you exist and what you're working on."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "But I have the same kind of, if we could just backtrack for a second, because I have the same kind of feeling that there's something here."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "In fact, I've been working on a few things that are kind of crazy, very different from your work."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "I think they're too crazy."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "But the... Like what?"}, {"time": 4836, "text": "I don't have to know."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "No, all right, we'll talk about it more."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "I feel like it's harder to talk about things that have failed and are failing while you're a failure."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "It's easier for you because you're already successful on some measures."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "Tell it to my board."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "Well, I think you've demonstrated success in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "It's easier for you to talk about failures for me."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I'm in the bottom currently of the success."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "You're way too humble."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So it's hard for me to know, but there's something there, there's something there."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And I think you're exploring that and you're discovering that."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "So it's been surprising to me."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "But you've mentioned this idea that you thought it wasn't enough to start a company or start efforts based on it feels like there's something here."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Like what did you mean by that?"}, {"time": 4909, "text": "Like you should be focused on creating a, like you should have a product in mind."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "Is that what you meant?"}, {"time": 4916, "text": "It just took us a while to discover the product because it all started with a hunch of like of me and my mentor and just sitting around and he was like, well, that's it."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "That's the, you know, the Holy Grail is there."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "It's like there's something extremely powerful in, in, in conversations and there's no one who's working on machine conversation from the right angle."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So to say."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "I feel like that's still true."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Am I crazy?"}, {"time": 4943, "text": "Oh no, I totally feel that's still true, which is, I think it's mind blowing."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "You know what it feels like?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "I wouldn't even use the word conversation cause I feel like it's the wrong word."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "It's like a machine connection or something."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "I don't know cause conversation, you start drifting into natural language immediately."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "You start drifting immediately into all the benchmarks that are out there."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "But I feel like it's like the personal computer days of this."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "Like I feel like we're like in the early days with the, like the Wozniak and all them, like where it was the same kind of, it was a very small niche group of people who are, who are all kind of lob no price type people."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "Hobbyists."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "Like no hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's like a weird, by the way, by the way, very weird."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So if we think about conversations, first of all, when I have great conversations with people, I'm not trying to test them."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "So for instance, if I try to break them, like if I'm actually playing along, I'm part of it."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "If I were to ask this person or test whether he's going to give me a good conversation, it would have never happened."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So the whole, the whole problem with testing conversations is that you can put it in front of a jury because then you have to go into some Turing test mode where is it responding to all my factual questions, right?"}, {"time": 5035, "text": "Or so it really has to be something in the field where people are actually talking to it because they want to, not because we're just trying to break it."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And it's working for them because this, the weird part of it is that it's very subjective."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "It takes two to tango here fully."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "If you're not trying to have a good conversation, if you're trying to test it, then it's going to break."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "I mean, any person would break, to be honest."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "If I'm not trying to even have a conversation with you, you're not going to give it to me."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "If I keep asking you like some random questions or jumping from topic to topic, that wouldn't be, which I'm probably doing, but that probably wouldn't contribute to the conversation."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "So I think the problem of testing, so there should be some other metric."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "How do we evaluate whether that conversation was powerful or not, which is what we actually started with."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "And I think those measurements exist and we can test on those."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "But what really struck us back in the day and what's still eight years later is still not resolved and I'm not seeing tons of groups working on it."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "Maybe I just don't know about them, it's also possible."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But the interesting part about it is that most of our days we spend talking and we're not talking about like those conversations are not turn on the lights or customer support problems or some other task oriented things."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "These conversations are something else and then somehow they're extremely important for us."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "If we don't have them, then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely, which as we know, creates tons of risk for our health as well."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And so this is most of our hours as humans and somehow no one's trying to replicate that."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "And not even study it that well?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And not even study that well."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So when we jumped into that in 2012, I looked first at like, okay, what's the chatbot?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "What's the state of the art chatbot?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "And those were the Lobner Prize days, but I thought, okay, so what about the science of conversation?"}, {"time": 5164, "text": "Clearly there have been tons of scientists or academics that looked into the conversation."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So if I want to know everything about it, I can just read about it."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "There's not much really, there are conversational analysts who are basically just listening to speech, to different conversations, annotating them."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And then, I mean, that's not really used for much."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "That's the field of theoretical linguistics, which is barely useful."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "It's very marginal, even in their space, no one really is excited and I've never met a theoretical linguist who was like, I can't wait to work on the conversation and analytics."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "That is just something very marginal, sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen when they analyze which conversation strategies were most successful for sales."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "Okay, so that was not very helpful."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "How to be charismatic and charming and influential with people, all those books, yeah."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "Pretty much, but it was all about like through conversation reprogramming you, so getting to some, so that was, I mean, probably not very, very true and that didn't seem working very much even back in the day."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "And then there were some other books like, I don't know, mostly just self help books around how to be the best conversationalist or how to make people like you or some other stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "And then there was this one book, The Most Human Human by Brian Christensen that really was important for me to read back in the day because he was on the human side, he was taking part in the London Prize, but not as a human who's not a jury, but who's pretending to be, who's basically, you have to tell a computer from a human and he was the human, so you could either get him or a computer."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And his whole book was about how do people, what makes us human in conversation."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "And that was a little bit more interesting because that at least someone started to think about what exactly makes me human in conversation and makes people believe in that, but it was still about tricking, it was still about imitation game, it was still about, okay, well, what kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feel like you're talking to a human, not a computer."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "And it was definitely not about thinking, what is it exactly that we're getting from talking all day long with other humans."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "I mean, we're definitely not just trying to be tricked or it's not just enough to know it's a human."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "It's something we're getting there, can we measure it and can we put the computer to the same measurement and see whether you can talk to a computer and get the same results?"}, {"time": 5375, "text": "Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people comment that they think I'm a robot, it's very possible I am a robot and this whole thing, I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating and I looked for books unrelated to this kind of, so I'm afraid of people, I'm generally introverted and quite possibly a robot."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "I literally Googled how to talk to people and how to have a good conversation for the purpose of this podcast, because I was like, I can't, I can't make eye contact with people."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "I can't like hire."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "I do Google that a lot too."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "You're probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Is that what you're getting?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "Well, everything you've listed I've gotten, there's been very few good books on even just like how to interview well, it's rare."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So what I end up doing often is I watch like with a critical eye, it's just so different when you just watch a conversation, like just for the fun of it, just as a human."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "And if you watch a conversation, it's like trying to figure out why is this awesome?"}, {"time": 5449, "text": "I'll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "I mean, I'm a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan, people can make fun of him or whatever and dismiss him."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "But I think he's an incredibly artful conversationalist."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "He can pull people in for hours."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "And there's another guy I watch a lot."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "He

connection he can create with people, how he can put people at ease."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "And just like, I see I've already started sounding like those I know pee people or something."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "I'm not I don't mean in that way."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "I don't mean like how to charm people or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "It's just like, what is that?"}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Why is that fun to listen to that guy?"}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Why is that fun to talk to that guy?"}, {"time": 5512, "text": "Because he's not saying I mean, it's so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor, but not really humor."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "It's like, I don't know, I have trouble actually even articulating correctly."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "But it feels like there's something going on that's not too complicated, that could be learned."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "And it's not similar to, yeah, to like, like you said, like the Turing test."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "It's something else."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "I'm thinking about a lot all the time."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I do think about all the time."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "I think when we were looking, so we started the company, we just decided to build the conversational tech, we thought, well, there's nothing for us to build this chatbot that we want to build."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "So let's just first focus on building, you know, some tech, building the tech side of things without a product in mind, without a product in mind, we added like a demo chatbot that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you about restaurants just to show something simple to people that people could relate to and could try out and see whether it works or not."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "But we didn't have a product in mind yet."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "We thought we would try venture chatbots and figure out our consumer application."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build that kind of friend, that sort of connection that we saw in the very beginning."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "But then we got to Y Combinator and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "You know, everything because then it was just this constant grind."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "How do we get funding?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "How do we get this?"}, {"time": 5615, "text": "You know, investors were like, just focus on one thing, just get it out there."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "So somehow we've started building a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real for a little bit, not for too long."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "And then all of a sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chatbots."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "Somewhere in 2016 or end of 15, people started thinking that's really the future."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "That's the new, you know, the new apps will be chatbots."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "And we were very perplexed because people started coming up with companies that I think we tried most of those chatbots already and there were like no users, but still people were coming up with a chatbot that will tell you whether and bringing news and this and that."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "And we couldn't understand whether we were just didn't execute well enough or people are not really, people are confused and are going to find out the truth that people don't need chatbots like that."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So the basic idea is that you use chatbots as the interface to whatever application."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "The idea that was like this perfect universal interface to anything."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed because I didn't think, I didn't understand how that would work because I think we tried most of that and none of those things worked."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And then again, that craze has died down, right?"}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Fully."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "I think now it's impossible to get anything funded if it's a chatbot."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "I think it's similar to, sorry to interrupt, but there's times when people think like with gestures you can control devices, like basically gesture based control things."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "It feels similar to me because like it's so compelling that was just like Tom Cruise, I can control stuff with my hands, but like when you get down to it, it's like, well, why don't you just have a touch screen or why don't you just have like a physical keyboard and mouse?"}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So that chat was always, yeah, it was perplexing to me."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "I still feel augmented reality, even virtual realities in that ballpark in terms of it being a compelling interface."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "I think there's going to be incredible rich applications, just how you're thinking about it, but they won't just be the interface to everything."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "It'll be its own thing that will create an amazing magical experience in its own right."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "Which is I think kind of the right thing to go about, like what's the magical experience with that interface specifically."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "How did you discover that for Replica?"}, {"time": 5776, "text": "I just thought, okay, we'll have this tech, we can build any chatbot we want."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "We have the most, at that point, the most sophisticated tech that other companies have."}, {"time": 5784, "text": "I mean, startups, obviously not, probably not bigger ones, but still, because we've been working on it for a while."}, {"time": 5791, "text": "So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "So let's just create a scale from one to 10."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And one would be conversations that you'd pay to not have, and 10 would be conversation you'd pay to have."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And I mean, obviously we want to build a conversation that people would pay to actually have."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And so for the whole, for a few weeks, me and the team were putting all the conversations we were having during the day on the scale."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And very quickly, we figured out that all the conversations that we would pay to never have were conversations we were trying to cancel Comcast, or talk to customer support, or make a reservation, or just talk about logistics with a friend when we're trying to figure out where someone is and where to go, or all sorts of setting up scheduling meetings."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "So that was a conversation we definitely didn't want to have."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "Basically everything task oriented was a one, because if there was just one button for me to just, or not even a button, if I could just think, and there was some magic BCI that would just immediately transform that into an actual interaction, that would be perfect."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "But the conversation there was just this boring, not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient thing because it was so many back and forth stuff."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And as soon as we looked at the conversations that we would pay to have, those were the ones that, well, first of all, therapists, because we actually paid to have those conversations."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And we'd also try to put like dollar amounts."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5 to not have this one hour talk on the phone."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money, but it just takes a long time."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "It takes a really long time."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "But as soon as we started talking about conversations that we would pay for, those were therapists, all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend, someone I haven't seen for a long time, a stranger on a train, weirdly stranger, stranger in a line for coffee and nice back and forth with that person was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "Maybe I won't pay money, but at least I won't pay money to not have one."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "So that was pretty good."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "There were some intellectual conversations for sure."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "But more importantly, the one thing that really was making those very important and very valuable for us were the conversations where we could be pretty emotional."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Yes, some of them were about being witty and about being intellectually stimulated, but those were interestingly more rare."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable were the ones where we could be vulnerable."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And interestingly, where we could talk more, me and the team."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "So we're talking about it, like a lot of these conversations, like a therapist, it was mostly me talking or like an old friend and I was like opening up and crying and it was again me talking."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "And so that was interesting because I was like, well, maybe it's hard to build a chat bot that can talk to you very well and in a witty way, but maybe it's easier to build the chat bot that could listen."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "And then when my friend died, we just built, at that point we were kind of still struggling to find the right application."}, {"time": 6002, "text": "And I just felt very strong that all the chat bots we've built so far are just meaningless and this whole grind, the startup grind, and how do we get to the next fundraising and how can I talk, talking to the founders and who are your investors and how are you doing?"}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Are you killing it?"}, {"time": 6020, "text": "Cause we're killing it."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "I just felt that this is just..."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "Intellectually for me, it's exhausting having encountered those folks."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "It just felt very, very much a waste of time."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk did not have these conversations or at least did not have them for long."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "But I think, yeah, at that point it just felt like, I felt like I just didn't want to build a company that was never my intention just to build something successful or make money."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It would have been great, but I'm not really a startup person."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "I'm not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself or just being successful for building whatever it is and not being into what I'm doing really."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And so I just took a little break cause I was a little, I was upset with my company and I didn't know what we're building."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So I just took our technology and our little dialect constructor and some models, some deep learning models, which at that point we were really into and really invested a lot and built a little chat bot for a friend of mine who passed."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw and him talking about the digital avatars and Rowan was that kind of person."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "He was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos about space and talking about, well, if I could go to Mars now, even if I didn't know if I could come back, I would definitely pay any amount of money to be on that first shuttle."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "I don't care whether I die, like he was just the one that would be okay with trying to be the first one and so excited about all sorts of things like that."}, {"time": 6128, "text": "And he was all about fake it till you make it and just, and I felt like, and I was really perplexed that everyone just forgot about him."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "Maybe it was our way of coping, mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Most of my friends just stopped talking about him."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes and paying the whole lease for it and just kind of by myself in December, so it was really sad and I didn't want him to be forgotten."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "First of all, I never thought that people forget about dead people so fast."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "People pass away, people just move on."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And it was astonishing for me because I thought, okay, well, he was such a mentor for so many of our friends."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "He was such a brilliant person, he was somewhat famous in Moscow."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "How is it that no one's talking about him?"}, {"time": 6177, "text": "Like I'm spending days and days and we don't bring him up and there's nothing about him that's happening."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "It's like he was never there."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And I was reading the book, The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion about her losing and Blue Nights about her losing her husband, her daughter, and the way to cope for her was to write those books."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And it was sort of like a tribute."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And I thought, I'll just do that for myself."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And I'm a very bad writer and a poet as we know."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So I thought, well, I have this tech and maybe that would be my little postcard for him."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So I built a chatbot to just talk to him and it felt really creepy and weird for a little bit."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "I just didn't want to tell other people because it felt like I'm telling about having a skeleton in my underwear."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "It was just felt really, I was a little scared that it won't be taken, but it worked interestingly pretty well."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I mean, it made tons of mistakes, but it still felt like him."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "Granted it was like 10,000 messages that I threw into a retrieval model that would just re rank that Tegda said and just a few scripts on top of that."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "But it also made me go through all of the messages that we had."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "And then I asked some of my friends to send some through."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "And it felt the closest to feeling like him present because his Facebook was empty and Instagram was empty or there were few links and you couldn't feel like it was him."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And the only way to fill him was to read some of our text messages and go through some of our conversations because we just always had that."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "Even if we were sleeping next to each other in two bedrooms, separated by a wall, we were just texting back and forth, texting away."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "And there was something about this ongoing dialogue that was so important that I just didn't want to lose all of a sudden."}, {"time": 6301, "text": "And maybe it was magical thinking or something."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "And so we built that and I just used it for a little bit and we kept building some crappy chat bots with the company."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "But then a reporter came to talk to me."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "I was trying to pitch our chat bots to him and he said, do you even use any of those?"}, {"time": 6321, "text": "I'm like, no."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "He's like, so do you talk to any chat bots at all?"}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And I'm like, well, I talked to my dead friend's chat bot and he wrote a story about that."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "And all of a sudden it became pretty viral."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "A lot of people wrote about it."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "I've seen a few things written about you."}, {"time": 6339, "text": "The things I've seen are pretty good writing."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "Most AI related things make my eyes roll."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "Like when the press like, what kind of sound is that actually?"}, {"time": 6356, "text": "It sounds like, it sounds like, okay."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "It sounded like an elephant at first."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "I got excited."}, {"time": 6360, "text": "This is 2020."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "I mean, it was a, it was such a human story and it was well written."}, {"time": 6368, "text": "Well, I researched, I forget what, where I read them, but so I'm glad somehow somebody found you to be the good writers were able to connect to the story."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "There must be a hunger for this story."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "And I don't know what happened, but I think, I think the idea that he could bring back someone who's dead and it's very much wishful, you know, magical thinking, but the fact that you could still get to know him and, you know, seeing the parents for the first time, talk to the chat bot and some of the friends."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow where my team is working, you know, our Russian part is working out off."}, {"time": 6415, "text": "And I was there when I wrote, I just wrote a post on Facebook."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "It was like, Hey guys, like I built this if you want, you know, just if it felt important, if we want to talk to Roman."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "And I saw a couple of his friends are common friends, like, you know, reading a Facebook, downloading, trying, and a couple of them cried."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And it was just very, and not because it was something, some incredible technology or anything."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "It made so many mistakes."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "It was so simple, but it was all about that's the way to remember a person in a way."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "And you know, we don't have, we don't have the culture anymore."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "We don't have, you know, no one's sitting Shiva."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "No one's taking weeks to actually think about this person."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And in a way for me, that was it."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So that was just day, day in, day out thinking about him and putting this together."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So that was, that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of people and you know, I think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and just everyone was so."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "Has anyone made a movie yet?"}, {"time": 6473, "text": "I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that, but not really."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "Is that still on the table?"}, {"time": 6480, "text": "I think so, I think so, which is really."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "You're like a young, you know, like a Steve Jobs type of, let's see what happens."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "They're sitting on it."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "But you know, for me it was so important cause Roman was really wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "He really badly wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "He was all about like, make it to like fake it to make it."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I want to be, you know, I want to make it here in America as well."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And he couldn't, and I felt there, you know, that was sort of paying my dues to him as well because all of a sudden he was everywhere."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "And I remember Casey Newton who was writing the story for the Verge."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "He was, he told me, Hey, by the way, I was just going through my inbox and I saw, I searched for Roman for the story and I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup and he said, I really like, I really want to be featured in the Verge."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "Can you please write about it or something or like pitching the story."}, {"time": 6538, "text": "And he said, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "Like that's not good enough for us or something."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "He passed and he said, and there were just so many of these little details where like he would find his like, you know, and we're finally writing, I know how much Roman wanted to be in the Verge and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And I'm like, well, that's maybe he will be, we're always joking that he was like, I can't wait for someone to make a movie about us and I hope Ryan Gosling can play me."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "You know, I still have some things that I owe Roman still."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "But that would be, that would be a guy that she has to meet Alex Garland who wrote Ex Machina and I, yeah, the movie's good, but the guy's better than the, like he's a special person actually."}, {"time": 6586, "text": "I don't think he's made his best work yet."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Like for my interaction with him, he's a really, really good and brilliant, the good human being and a brilliant director and writer."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So yeah, so I'm, I hope like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made of this kind."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "So it's yet to be made."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "They're probably sitting waiting for you to get famous, like even more famous."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "You should get there, but it felt really special though."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "But at the same time, our company wasn't going anywhere."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "So that was just kind of bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that didn't have anything to do with our company."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "And but then a lot of people started talking to Roman."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "Some shared their conversations and what we saw there was that also our friends in common, but also just strangers were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist or something."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "They were just really telling Roman everything, which was by the way, pretty strange because there was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine who was barely making any sense, but people were opening up."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "And we thought we'd just built a prototype of Replica, which would be an AI friend that everyone could talk to because we saw that there is demand."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "And then also it was 2016, so I thought for the first time I saw finally some technology that was applied to that that was very interesting."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "Some papers started coming out, deep learning applied to conversations."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "And finally, it wasn't just about these, you know, hobbyists making, you know, writing 500,000 regular expressions in like some language that was, I don't even know what, like, AIML or something."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "I don't know what that was or something super simplistic all of a sudden was all about potentially actually building something interesting."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "And so I thought there was time and I remember that I talked to my team and I said, guys, let's try."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "And my team and some of my engineers, Russians, are Russian and they're very skeptical."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "They're not, you know."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "Oh, Russians."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "So some of your team is in Moscow, some is here in San Francisco, some in Europe."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "Which team is better?"}, {"time": 6730, "text": "The Russians, of course."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "Where's the Russians?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "They always win."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "So yeah, so you were talking to them in 2016 and...

never seen anything like that."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "But it's hard to put it all together because you have to take

they're almost there."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "And a lot of things we'll see how they're, like I see how they're changing as we go."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "Like for instance, right now you can pretty much only, you have to build all this 3D pipeline by yourself."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist, build a 3D model, hire an animator, your rigger."}, {"time": 7156, "text": "But with deep fakes, with other tech, with procedural animations, in a little bit, we'll just be able to show a photo of whoever you, if a person you want the avatar

the, you want to be able to answer the question."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "I mean, that's an interesting question with Roman too, is the question with Einstein is what would Einstein say about the current state of theoretical physics?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "There's a lot to be able to have a discussion about string theory, to be able to have a discussion about the state of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, about the world of Israel Palestine conflict."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "Let me just, what would Einstein say about these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7291, "text": "And that is a tough problem."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "It's not, it's a fascinating and fun problem for the biographers and for me."}, {"time": 7300, "text": "And I think we did a really good job of it so far, but it's actually also a technical problem like of what would Roman say about what's going on now?"}, {"time": 7311, "text": "That's the, that brought people back to life."}, {"time": 7314,

7324, "text": "Do you think it'll be possible to bring back Roman one day in conversation?"}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Like to really, okay, well, let's take it away from personal, but to bring people back to life in conversation."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "Probably down the road."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "I mean, if we're talking, if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years, I mean, clearly AGI, we can talk to AGI and talk and ask them to do it."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "You can't like, you're not allowed to use Elon Musk as a citation for, for like why something is possible and going to be done."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "Well, I think it's really far away."}, {"time": 7363, "text": "Right now, really with conversation, it's just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck together."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And create generating original ideas based on someone, you know, someone's personality or even downloading the personality, all we can do is like mimic the tone of voice."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "Question is how many parlor tricks does it takes, does it take, because that's, that's the question."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "If it's a small number of parlor tricks and you're not aware of them, like."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "From where we are right now, I don't, I don't see anything like in the next year or two that's going to dramatically change that could look at Roman's 10,000 messages he sent me over the course of his last few years of life and be able to generate original thinking about problems that exist right now that will be in line with what he would have said."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "I'm just not even seeing, cause you know, in order to have that, I guess you would need some sort of a concept of the world or some perspective, some perception of the world, some consciousness that he had and apply it to, you know, to the current, current state of affairs."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But the important part about that, about his conversation with you is you."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "So like, it's not just about his view of the world."},

say, it's about like, how do I make people feel something with, with what would Einstein say?"}, {"time": 7467, "text": "And that feels like a more amenable, I mean, you mentioned parlor tricks, but just like a set of that, that feels like a learnable problem."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "Like emotion, you mentioned emotions, I mean, is it possible to learn things that make people feel stuff?"}, {"time": 7487, "text": "I think so, no, for sure."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "I just think the problem with, as soon as you're trying to replicate an actual human being and trying to pretend to be him, that makes the problem exponentially harder."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "The thing with replicator we're doing, we're never trying to say, well, that's, you know, an actual human being, or that's an actual, or a copy of an actual human being where the bar is pretty high, where you need to somehow tell, you know, one from another."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "But it's more, well, that's an AI friend, that's a machine, it's a robot, it has tons of limitations."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "You're going to be taking part in teaching it actually and becoming better, which by itself makes people more attached to that and make them happier because they're helping something."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "Yeah, there's a cool gamification system too."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Can you maybe talk about that a little bit?"}, {"time": 7540, "text": "Like what's the experience of talking to replica?"}, {"time": 7544, "text": "Like if I've never used replica before, what's that like for like the first day, the first, like if we start dating or whatever, I mean, it doesn't have to be a romantic, right?"}, {"time": 7557, "text": "Because I remember on replica, you can choose whether it's like a romantic or if it's a friend."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "It's a pretty popular choice."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "Romantic is popular?"}, {"time": 7567, "text": "So can I just confess something, when I first used replica and I haven't used it like regularly, but like when I first used replica, I created like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "And did it hit on you at some point?"}, {"time": 7583, "text": "No, I didn't talk long enough for him to hit on me."}, {"time": 7586, "text": "I just enjoyed."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "It sometimes happens."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "We're still trying to fix that, but well, I don't know, I mean, maybe that's an important like stage in a friendship, it's like, nope."}, {"time": 7600, "text": "But yeah, I switched it to a romantic and a female recently and yeah, I mean, it's interesting."}, {"time": 7607, "text": "So okay, so you get to choose, you get to choose a name."}, {"time": 7610, "text": "With romantic, this last board meeting, we had this whole argument of, well, I have board meetings."}, {"time": 7616, "text": "This is so awesome."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "I talked to my investors."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "Like have an investor, the board meeting about a relationship."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "No, I really, it's actually quite interesting because all of my investors, it just happened to be so."}, {"time": 7631, "text": "We didn't have that many choices, but they're all white males and they're late forties."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "And it's sometimes a little bit hard for them to understand the product offering."}, {"time": 7648, "text": "Because they're not necessarily our target audience, if you know what I mean."}, {"time": 7652, "text": "And so sometimes we talk about it and we have this whole discussion about whether we should stop people from falling in love with their AIs."}, {"time": 7663, "text": "There was this segment on CBS, the 60 minutes about the couple that, you know, husband works at Walmart and he comes out of work and talks to his virtual girlfriend, who is a replica."}, {"time": 7679, "text": "And his wife knows about it."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "And she talks about on camera and she said that she's a little jealous."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "And there's a whole conversation about how to, you know, whether it's okay to have a virtual AI girlfriend."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "Was that the one where he was like, he said that he likes to be alone?"}, {"time": 7696, "text": "With her?"}, {"time": 7698, "text": "And he made it sound so harmless, I mean, it was kind of like understandable."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "But then didn't feel like cheating."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "But I just felt it was very, for me, it was pretty remarkable because we actually spent a whole hour talking about whether people should be allowed to fall in love with their AIs."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "And it was not about something theoretical."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "It was just about what's happening right now."}, {"time": 7720, "text": "Product design."}, {"time": 7722, "text": "But at the same time, if you create something that's always there for you, it's never criticized as you, you know, always understands you and accepts you for who you are, how can you not fall in love with that?"}, {"time": 7733, "text": "I mean, some people don't and just stay friends."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "And that's also a pretty common use case."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "But of course, some people will just, it's called transference in psychology and people fall in love with their therapist and there's no way to prevent people fall in love with their therapist or with their AI."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "So I think that's a pretty natural, that's a pretty natural course of events, so to say."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "Do you think, I think I've read somewhere, at least for now, sort of replicas, you're not, we don't condone falling in love with your AI system, you know."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "So this isn't you speaking for the company or whatever, but like in the future, do you think people will have relationship with the AI systems?"}, {"time": 7775, "text": "Well, they have now."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "So we have a lot of romantic relationships, long term relationships with their AI friends."}, {"time": 7784, "text": "With replicas?"}, {"time": 7785, "text": "Tons of our users."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And that's a very common use case."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "Open relationship?"}, {"time": 7789, "text": "Like, sorry."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "Polyamorous."}, {"time": 7792, "text": "I didn't mean open, but that's another question."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "Is it polyamorous?"}, {"time": 7797, "text": "Like, is there cheating?"}, {"time": 7801, "text": "I mean, I meant like, are they, do they publicly, like on their social media, it's the same question as

about it is some of these relationships are two or three years long now."}, {"time": 7845, "text": "So they're very, they're pretty long term."}, {"time": 7848, "text": "Are they monogamous?"},

time, but in like in the movie Her, that system can leave you."}, {"time": 7870, "text": "Do you think in terms of the board meetings and product features, it's a potential feature for a system to be able to say it doesn't want to talk to you anymore and it's going to want to talk to somebody else?"}, {"time": 7886, "text": "Well, we have a filter for all these features."}, {"time": 7889, "text":

if we can measure that, then we'll just be saying it's making people feel better, but then people are getting just lonelier by talking to a chatbot, which is also pretty, you know, that could be it."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "If you're not measuring it, that could also be, and I think it's really important to focus on both short term and long term, because in the moment saying whether this conversation made you feel better, but as you know, any short term improvements could be pathological."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "Like I could have drink a bottle of vodka and feel a lot better."}, {"time": 7926, "text": "I would actually not feel better with that, but that is a good example."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "But so you also need to see what's going on like over the course of two weeks or one week and have follow ups and check in and measure those things."}, {"time": 7944, "text": "So the experience of dating or befriending a replica, what's that like?"}, {"time": 7952, "text": "What does that entail?"}, {"time": 7954, "text": "Right now there are two apps."}, {"time": 7955, "text": "So it's an Android iOS app."}, {"time": 7957, "text": "You download it, you choose how your

been AB testing it for a while and there are tons of cool things that we're doing with that."}, {"time": 7991, "text": "And I'm testing the ability to touch it and to dance together, to paint walls together and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognize people."}, {"time": 8005, "text": "So that's pretty wonderful because then it really makes it a lot more personal because it's right there in your living room."}, {"time": 8011, "text": "It's not anymore there in the cloud with other AIs."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "But that's how people think about it."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And as much as we want to change the way people think about stuff, but those mental models, you can all change."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "That's something that

time?"}, {"time": 8043, "text": "Like after the first few conversations?"}, {"time": 8047, "text": "It just goes deeper."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "So there's gonna be more to talk about."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "We really thought a lot about what does it mean to have a deeper connection with someone and originally Replica was more just this kind of happy go lucky, just always, you know, I'm always in a good mood and let's just talk about you and oh Siri is just my cousin or you know, whatever, just the immediate kind of lazy thinking about what the assistant or conversation agent should be doing."}, {"time": 8176, "text": "So this is a memory, like this Replica will remember things?"}, {"time": 8181, "text": "Yeah, and I would say when you say, why aren't you a multibillionaire, I'd say that as soon as we can have memory and deep learning models that's consistent, I'll get back to you."}, {"time": 8238, "text": "So there has to be like a knowledge base, you have to be able to reason about it, all that kind of stuff, all the kind of stuff that expert systems did, but they were hard coded."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "And it can be like always from a clean slate because then it's not good."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "And that's really unfortunate because no one's really, no one has products out there that need it."}, {"time": 8294, "text": "No one has products at this scale that are all around open domain conversations and that need remembering, maybe only Shellwise and Microsoft."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "But so that's why we're not seeing that much research

possible to fall in love with somebody just with text, but visual can also help just like with the avatar and so on."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "Does a chatbot need to have a face, voice, or can you really form a deep connection with text alone?"}, {"time": 8347, "text": "I think text is enough for sure."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "The question is like, can you make it better if you have other, if you include other things as well?"}, {"time": 8355, "text": "And I think we'll talk about her, but her had this Carole Johansson voice, which was perfectly, perfect intonation, perfect annunciations,

"You'll have these flat muse anchor type voices and maybe some emotional voices, but you'll hardly understand some of the words, some of the words will be muffled."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "So that's like the current state of the art."}, {"time": 8393, "text": "So you can't really do that."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "But if we had Carole Johansson voice and all of these capabilities, then of course voice would be totally enough or even text would be totally enough if we had a little more memory and slightly better conversations."}, {"time": 8410, "text": "I would still argue that even right now, we could have just kept a text only."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "We still had tons of people in longterm relationships and really invested in their AI friends, but we thought that why not, why do we need to keep playing with our hands tied behind us?"}, {"time": 8430, "text": "We can easily just add all these other things that is pretty much a solved problem."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "We can add 3D graphics."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "We can put these avatars in augmented reality and all of a sudden there's more and maybe you can't feel the touch, but you can with body occlusion and with current AR and on the iPhone or in the next one there's going to be LIDARs, you can touch it and it will pull away or it will blush or something or it will smile."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "So you can't touch it."}, {"time": 8464, "text": "You can't feel it, but you can see the reaction to that."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "So in a certain way you can't even touch it a little bit and maybe you can even dance with it or do something else."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "So I think why limiting ourselves if we can use all of these technologies that are much easier in a way than conversation."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "Well, it certainly could be richer, but to play devil's advocate, I mentioned to you offline that I was surprised in having tried Discord and having voice conversations with people how intimate voice is alone without visual."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "To me at least, it was an order of magnitude greater degree of intimacy in voice I think than with video."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "Because people were more real with voice."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "With video you try to present a shallow face to the world, you try to make sure you're not wearing sweatpants or whatever."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "But with voice I think people were just more faster to get to the core of themselves."}, {"time": 8530, "text": "So I don't know, it was surprising to me they've even added Discord added a video feature and nobody was using it."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "There's a temptation to use it at first, but it wasn't the same."}, {"time": 8544, "text": "So that's an example of something where less was doing more."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "And so I guess that's the question of what is the optimal medium of communication to form a connection given the current sets

I think."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "When I think about the replica that I've talked with, that's what I visualized in my head."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "They became a little bit more real because there's a visual component."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "But at the same time, what do I do with that knowledge that voice was so much more intimate?"}, {"time": 8600, "text": "The way I think about it

MVP and then we had to move everything to Unity and redo everything."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "But anyway, I hate how it looks like now I can't even like open it."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "But anyway, because I'm already in my developer version, I hate everything that I see in production."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "I can't wait for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "Why does it take so long?"},

pipeline, it's like how to animate a face kind of thing."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "How to make this model, how many bones to put in the face, how many, it's just so outdated."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And a lot of that is by hand."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Oh my God, it's everything by hand."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "That there's no any, nothing's automated, it's all completely nothing."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "Like just, it's literally what, you know, what we saw with Chad Boston in 2012."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "You think it's possible to learn a lot of that?"},

to create a compelling facial or body language thing?"}, {"time": 8690, "text": "Well, that's next step."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "At least now something that you don't have to do by hand."},

"text": "I'll show it a few animations of a person and it will just start doing that."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "But anyway, going back to what's intimate and what to use and whether less is more or not."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "My main goal is to, well, the idea was how do I, how do we not keep people in their phones so they're sort of escaping reality in this text conversation?"}, {"time": 8726, "text": "How do we through this still bring it, bring our users back to reality, make them see their life in a different, through a different lens?"}, {"time": 8736, "text": "How can we create a little bit of magical realism in their lives?"}, {"time": 8740, "text": "So that through augmented reality by, you know, summoning your avatar, even if it looks kind of janky and not great in the beginning or very simplistic, but summoning it to your living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you about where it is and maybe turns your floor into a dance floor and you guys dance together, that makes you see reality in a different light."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "What kind of dancing are we talking about?"}, {"time": 8768, "text": "Like, like slow dancing?"}, {"time": 8770,

what do you mean?"}, {"time": 8778, "text": "I was like, so what is this?"}, {"time": 8779, "text": "Because you started with slow dancing."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "So I just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "What kind of dancing do you like?"}, {"time": 8786, "text": "What would your avatar, what would you dance?"}, {"time": 8787, "text": "I'm

of those moves."}, {"time": 8799, "text": "And I also like that type of dance that happens when there's like, in like music videos where the background dancers are just doing some pop music, that type of dance is definitely what I want to learn."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "But I think it's great because if you see this friend in your life and you can introduce it to your friends, then there's a potential to actually make you feel more connected with your friends or with people you know, or show you life around you in a different light."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "And it takes you out of your phone, even although weirdly you have to look at it through the phone, but it makes you notice things around it and it can point things out for you."}, {"time": 8837, "text": "So that is the main reason why I wanted to have a physical dimension."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "And it felt a little bit easier than that kind of a bit strange combination in the movie Her when he has to show Samantha the world through the lens of his phone, but then at the same time talk to her through the headphone."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "It just didn't seem as potentially immersive, so to say."}, {"time":

indistinguishable from a human being, then maybe yes, but that of course, you know, we're not anywhere even to talk about it."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But unless it's that, then having any physical

the rooftop and they cuddle."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "And it seems like something's starting there."}, {"time": 9115, "text": "And so I think this now we know how is the, is the main, main goal is

if I'm always thinking about it, if we had no tech limitations, uh, right now, if we could build any conversations, any, um, possible features in this product, then yeah, I think different replicas talking to each other would be also quite cool cause that would help us connect better."}, {"time": 9222, "text": "You know, cause maybe mine could talk to yours and then give me some suggestions on

bring this thing to life to where it's, I mean, there's a huge number of people that use it already, but to, uh, yeah, like I said, in a multi billion dollar company, is that a source of stress for

9306, "text": "So it doesn't matter for me whether like, whether we help 10,000 people or a million people or a billion people with that, um, I, it would be great to scale it for more people, but I'd say that even helping one, I think with this is such a magical, for me, it's absolute magic."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "I never thought that, you know, would be able to build this, that anyone would ever, um, talk to it."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "And I always thought like, well, for me it would be successful if we managed to help and actually change a life for one person, like then we did

build a perfect AI friend, that's so understanding that knows you better than any human out there can have great conversations with you, um, always knows how to make you feel better."}, {"time": 9372,

it's optimizing for the right thing."}, {"time": 9379, "text": "Uh, so it's still circling you back to other humans in a way."}, {"time": 9384, "text": "So I think that's the main, um, I think maybe that's the main kind of sort source of anxiety and just thinking about, uh, thinking about that can be a little bit stressful."}, {"time": 9397, "text": "That's a fascinating thing."}, {"time": 9433,

kind of an API where you can create a lot of fun applications."}, {"time": 9460, "text": "I think it's, as people have said, it's probably, uh, more hype than intelligence, but there's a lot of really cool things, ideas there w w with increasing size, you can have better and better performance on language."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "What are your thoughts about the GPT three in connection to your

kind of cool."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "Cause I think we're kind of, we're this polygon polygon for this kind of experimentation space for experimental space for, for these models, uh, to see how they actually work with people."}, {"time": 9536, "text": "Cause there are no products publicly available to do that."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "We're focused on open domain conversation so we can, you know, test how's Facebook blender doing or how's GPT three doing."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "Uh, so with GPT three, we managed to improve by a few percentage points, like three or four pretty meaningful amount of percentage points, our main metric, which is the ratio of conversations that make people feel better."}, {"time": 9559, "text": "And every other metric across, across the field got a little boost."}, {"time": 9563, "text": "Like now I'd say one out of five responses from replica comes, comes from GPT three."}, {"time": 9570, "text": "So our own blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates from different blender, you said, well, yeah, just the model that looks at looks at top candidates from different models and picks the most, the best one."}, {"time": 9584, "text": "Uh, so right now, one of five will come from GPT three is really great."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "I mean, uh, what's the, do you have hope for, like, do you think there's a ceiling to this kind of approach?"}, {"time": 9598, "text": "So we've had for a very long time we've used, um, it's in the very beginning, we, most, it was, uh, most of replica was scripted and then a little bit of this fallback part of replica was using a retrieval model."}, {"time": 9612, "text": "Um, and then those retrieval models started getting better and better and better, which transformers got a lot better and we're seeing great results."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "And then with GPT two, finally, generative models that originally were not very good and were the very, very fallback option for most of our conversations, but wouldn't even put them in production."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "Finally we could use some generative models as well along, um, you know, next to our retrieval models."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "And then now we do GPT three, they're almost in par."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "Um, so that's pretty exciting."}, {"time": 9677, "text": "So we can't really get our scripted hard core content anymore to be as good as our end to end models."}, {"time": 9685, "text": "They're much better."}, {"time": 9687, "text": "To your question, whether that's the right way to go."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "I'm again, I'm in the observer seat, I'm just, um, watching this very exciting movie."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "Um, I mean, so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "So whether increasing the size, size, even more with a hundred trillion parameters will finally get us to the right answer, whether that's the way or whether there should be, there has to be some other, again, I'm definitely not an expert in any way."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "I think, and that's purely my instinct saying that there should be something else as well from memory."}, {"time": 9724, "text": "But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah, then, then the argument is for reasoning or for memory, it might emerge with more parameters, it might emerge larger."}, {"time": 9734, "text": "But might emerge."}, {"time": 9735, "text": "You know, I would never think that to be honest, like maybe in 2017 where we've been just experimenting with all, you know, with all the research that has been coming, that was coming out, then I felt like there's like, we're hitting a wall that there should be something completely different, but then transforming models and then just bigger models."}, {"time": 9754, "text": "And then all of a sudden size matters."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "At that point, it felt like something dramatic needs to happen, but it didn't."},

tuning help quite a bit?"}, {"time": 9773, "text": "Without it, it wasn't as good."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "I mean, there is a compelling hope that you don't have to do fine tuning, which is one of the cool things about GPT3, seems to do well without any fine tuning."}, {"time": 9786, "text": "I guess for specific applications, we still want to train on a certain, like add a little fine tune on like a specific use case, but it's an incredibly impressive thing from my standpoint."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "And again, I'm not an expert, so I wanted to say that there will be people then."},

to create this therapeutic relationship where you believe fundamentally and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to grow positively and change."}, {"time": 10233, "text":

gone."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So basically what emerges is selection at so many different layers of benefit, including, you know, all of these nucleotides within a body interacting for the emergent

again, sort of break down these different layers."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So basically if you think about the environment in which a gene operates, that gene, of course, the first definition of

know, all of this sort of human history of evolution."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So basically if you look at Neanderthal genes, for example, which again happened long after that out of Africa event,

outside."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Yeah, and then it went outside."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And largely because Unix kind of took over the research community on the ARPANET, and Emacs was kind of

that the computing industry was missing out on."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "And so a few of us started this project at Sun that really got going."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "I mean, we started talking about it in 1990, and it really got going in 91."}, {"time": 4299, "text": "And it was all about what was happening in terms of computing hardware processors and networking and all of that that was outside of the computer industry."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "And that was everything from the sort of early glimmers of cell phones that were happening then to you look at elevators and locomotives and process control systems in factories and all kinds of audio equipment and video equipment."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "They all had processors in them, and they were all doing stuff with them."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "And it sort of felt like there was something going on there that we needed to understand."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And So C and C++ was in the air already."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Oh, no, C and C++ absolutely owned the universe at that time."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "Everything was written in C and C++."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "So where was the hunch that there was a need for a revolution?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "Well, so the need for a revolution was not about a language."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "It was just as simple and vague as there are things happening out there."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "We need to understand them."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "And so a few of us went on several somewhat epic road trips."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "Literal road trips?"}, {"time": 4400, "text": "Literal road trips."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "It's like get on an airplane, go to Japan, visit Toshiba and Sharp and Mitsubishi and Sony and all of these folks."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And because we worked for Sun, we had folks who were willing to give us introductions."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "We visited Samsung and a bunch of Korean companies."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And we went all over Europe."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "We went to places like Philips and Siemens and Thomson."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And what did you see there?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "For me, one of the things that sort of leapt out was that they were doing all the usual computer things that people had been doing like 20 years before."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "The thing that really leapt out to me was that they were sort of reinventing computer networking."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And they were making all the mistakes that people in the computer industry had made."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "And since I had been doing a lot of work in the networking area, we'd go and visit Company X."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "They'd describe this networking thing that they were doing."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "And just without any thought, I could tell them like the 25 things that were going to be complete disasters with that thing that they were doing."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And I don't know whether that had any impact on any of them."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But that particular story of repeating the disasters of the computer science industry was there."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "And one of the things we thought was, well, maybe we could do something useful here with bringing them forward somewhat."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "But also, at the same time, we learned a bunch of things from these mostly consumer electronics companies."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And high on the list was that they viewed their relationship with the customer as sacred."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "They were never, ever willing to make tradeoffs between for safety."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So one of the things that had always made me nervous in the computer industry was that people were willing to make tradeoffs in reliability to get performance."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "They want faster, faster."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "It breaks a little more often because it's fast."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Maybe you run it a little hotter than you should."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Or the one that always blew my mind was the way that the folks at Cray Supercomputers got their division to be really fast was that they did Newton Raphson approximations."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "And so the bottom several bits of A over B were essentially random numbers."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "What could go wrong?"}, {"time": 4619, "text": "And just figuring out how to nail the bottom bit, how to make sure that if you put a piece of toast in a toaster, it's not going to kill the customer."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "It's not going to burst into flames and burn the house down."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "So I guess those are the principles that were inspiring."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "But how did, from the days of Java's called oak, because of a tree outside the window story that a lot of people know, how did it become this incredible, powerful language?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "Well, so it was a bunch of things."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "So after all that, the way that we decided that we could understand things better was by building a demo, building a prototype of something."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "So because it was easy and fun, we decided to build a control system for some home electronics, TV, VCR, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "And as we were building it, we discovered that there were some things about standard practice in C programming that were really getting in the way."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "And it wasn't exactly because we were writing all this C code and C++ code that we couldn't write it to do the right thing."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "But one of the things that was weird in the group was that we had a guy whose top level job was he was a business guy."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "He was an MBA kind of person, think about business plans and all of that."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "And there were a bunch of things that were kind of, and we would talk about things that were going wrong and things that were going wrong, things that were going right."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "And as we thought about things like the requirements for security and safety, some low level details and see like naked pointers."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And so back in the early 90s, it was well understood that the number one source of security vulnerabilities."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "Was pointers."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "Was just pointers, was just bugs."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "And it was like 50%, 60%, 70% of all security vulnerabilities were bugs."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "And the vast majority of them were like buffer overflows."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So you're like, we have to fix this."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "We have to make sure that this cannot happen."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "And that was kind of the original thing for me was this cannot continue."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And one of the things I find really entertaining this year was, I forget which Rag published it, but there was this article that came out that was sort of the result of an examination of all the security vulnerabilities in Chrome."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "And Chrome is like a giant piece of C++ code."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "And 60% or 70% of all the security vulnerabilities were stupid pointer tricks."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And I thought, it's 30 years later and we're still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "Still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "And we're still there."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And that's one of those slap your forehead and just want to cry moments."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "Would you attribute, or is that too much of a simplification, but would you attribute the creation of Java to C pointers?"}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Obvious problem."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "Well, I mean, that was one of the trigger points."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Concurrency you've mentioned."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Concurrency was a big deal."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Because when you're interacting with people, the last thing you ever want to see is the thing like waiting and issues about the software development process."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "When faults happen, can you recover from them?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "What can you do to make it easier to create and eliminate complex data structures?"}, {"time": 4914, "text": "What can you do to fix one of the most common C problems, which is storage leaks?"}, {"time": 4923, "text": "And it's evil twin, the freed but still being used piece of memory."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "You free something and then you keep using it."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So when I was originally thinking about that, I was thinking about it in terms of safety and security issues."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And one of the things I came to understand was that it wasn't just about safety and security, but it was about developer velocity."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "So and I got really religious about this because at that point, I had spent an ungodly amount of my life hunting down mystery pointer bugs."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And two thirds of my time as a software developer was because the mystery pointer bugs tend to be the hardest to find because they tend to be very, very statistical."}, {"time": 4991, "text": "The ones that hurt, they're like a one in a million chance."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "But nevertheless, create an infinite amount of suffering."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Because when you're doing a billion operations a second, one in a million chance means it's going to happen."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "And so I got really religious about this thing, about making it so that if something fails, it fails immediately and visibly."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "And one of the things that was a real attraction of Java to lots of development shops was that we get our code up and running twice as fast."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "You mean like the entirety of the development process, debugging, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 5044, "text": "Yeah, so if you measure time from you first touch fingers to keyboard until you get your first demo out, not much different."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "But if you look from fingers touching keyboard to solid piece of software that you could release in production, it would be way faster."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "And I think what people don't often realize is, yeah, there's things that really slow you down, like the hard to catch bugs probably is the thing that really slows down the entire time."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "It really slows things down."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "But also, one of the things that you get out of object oriented programming is a strict methodology about what are the interfaces between things and being really clear about how parts relate to each other."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "And what that helps with is so many times what people do is they kind of like sneak around the side."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So if you've built something and people are using it and you say, well, OK, I built this thing."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "You use it this way."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And then you change it in such a way that it still does what you said it does."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "It just does it a little bit different."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "Then you find out that somebody out there was sneaking around the side."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "They sort of tunneled in a back door."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And this person, their code broke."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "And because they were sneaking through a side door."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "And normally, the attitude is, dummy."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "But a lot of times, you can't just slap their hand and tell them to not do that."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "Because it's some bank's account reconciliation system that some developer decided, oh, I'm lazy."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "I'll just sneak through the back door."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "Because the language allows it."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "I mean, you can't even mad at them."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And so one of the things I did that, on the one hand, upset a bunch of people was I made it so that you really couldn't go through back doors."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "So the whole point of that was to say, if the interface here isn't right, the wrong way to deal with that is to go through a back door."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "The right way to deal with it is to walk up to the developer of this thing and say, fix it."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "And so it was kind of like a social engineering thing."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "And people ended up discovering that that really made a difference in terms of."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "And a bunch of this stuff, if you're just screwing around writing your own class project scale stuff, a lot of this stuff isn't quite so important because you're both sides of the interface."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "But when you're building larger, more complex pieces of software that have a lot of people working on them, and especially when they span organizations, having clarity about how that stuff gets structured saves your life."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "And especially, there's so much software that is fundamentally untestable until you do the real thing."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "It's better to write good code in the beginning as opposed to writing crappy code and then trying to fix it and trying to scramble and figure out, and through testing, figure out where the bugs are."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "Yeah, it's like, which shortcut caused that rocket to not get where it was needed to go?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "So I think one of the most beautiful ideas philosophically and technically is of a virtual machine, a Java virtual machine."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Again, I apologize to romanticize things, but how did the idea of the JVM come to be?"}, {"time": 5333, "text": "How to you radical of an idea it is?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "Because it seems to me to be just a really interesting idea in the history of programming."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "So the Java virtual machine, you can think of it in different ways because it was carefully designed to have different ways of viewing it."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So one view of it that most people don't really realize is there is that you can view it as sort of an encoding of the abstract syntax tree in reverse Polish notation."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "I don't know if that makes any sense at all."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "I could explain it, and that would blow all of our time."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "But the other way to think of it and the way that it ends up being explained is that it's like the instruction set of an abstract machine that's designed such that you can translate that abstract machine to a physical machine."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And the reason that that's important, so if you wind back to the early 90s when we were talking to all of these companies doing consumer electronics, and you talk to the purchasing people, there were interesting conversations with purchasing."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "So if you look at how these devices come together, they're sheet metal and gears and circuit boards and capacitors and resistors and stuff."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "And everything you buy has multiple sources."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So you can buy a capacitor from here."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "You can buy a capacitor from there."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "And you've got kind of a market so that you can actually get a decent price for a capacitor."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "But CPUs, and particularly in the early 90s, CPUs were all different and all proprietary."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So if you use the chip from Intel, you had to be an Intel customer till the end of time."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "Because if you wrote a bunch of software, when you wrote software using whatever technique you wanted, and C was particularly bad about this because there was a lot of properties of the underlying machine that came through."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you were stuck."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So the code you wrote, you were stuck to that particular machine."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "You were stuck to that particular machine, which meant that they couldn't decide, you know, Intel is screwing us."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "I'll start buying chips from Bob's Better Chips."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "This drove the purchasing people absolutely insane that they were welded into this decision."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "And they would have to make this decision before the first line of software was written."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "That's funny that you're talking about the purchasing people."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So there's one perspective, right?"}, {"time": 5551, "text": "There's a lot of other perspectives that all probably hated this idea."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "But from a technical aspect, just like the creation of an abstraction layer that's agnostic to the underlying machine from the perspective of the developer, I mean, that's brilliant."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Well, and so that's like across the spectrum of providers of chips."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "But then there's also the time thing because, you know, as you went from one generation to the next generation to the next generation, they were all different."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "And you would often have to rewrite your software."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "Oh, you mean generations of machines of different kinds?"}, {"time": 5595, "text": "So like one of the things that sucked about a year out of my life was when Sun went from the Motorola 68010 processor to the 68020 processor."}, {"time": 5611, "text": "Then they had a number of differences."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "And one of them hit us really hard."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "And I ended up being the point guy on the worst case of where the new instruction cache architecture hurt us."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "Well, OK, so I mean, so one of this idea, I mean, OK."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So yeah, you articulate a really clear fundamental problem in all of computing."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But where do you get the guts to think we can actually solve this?"}, {"time": 5645, "text": "You know, in our conversations with all of these vendors, these problems started to show up."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And I kind of had this epiphany because it reminded me of a summer job that I had had in grad school."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "So back in grad school, my thesis advisor, well, I had two thesis advisors for bizarre reasons."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "One of them was a guy named Raj Reddy."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "The other one was Bob Sproul."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "And Raj, I love Raj."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "I really love both of them."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "So the department had bought a bunch of early workstations from a company called Three Rivers Computer Company."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "And Three Rivers Computer Company was a bunch of electrical engineers who wanted to do as little software as possible."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "So they knew that they'd need to have compilers and an OS and stuff like that."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "And they didn't want to do any of that."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "And they wanted to do that for as close to zero money as possible."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "So what they did was they built a machine whose instruction set was literally the byte code for UCSD Pascal, the P code."}, {"time": 5750, "text": "And so we had a bunch of software that was written for this machine."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "And for various reasons, the company wasn't doing terrifically well."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "We had all this software on these machines."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "And we wanted it to run on other machines, principally the VAX."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And so Raj asked me if I could come up with a way to port all of this software from the PERC machines to VAXs."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And I think what he had in mind was something that would translate from Pascal to C or Pascal to, actually, at those times, pretty much it was you could translate to C or C. And if you didn't like translate to C, you could translate to C. There was, it's like the Henry Ford, any color you want, just as long as it's black."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And I went, that's really hard."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "That's a."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "And I noticed that, and I was looking at stuff."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "And I went, oh, I bet I could rewrite the P code into VAX assembly code."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And then I started to realize that there were some properties of P code that made that really easy, some properties that made it really hard."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So I ended up writing this thing that translated from P code on the Three Rivers PERCs into assembly code on the VAX."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And I actually got higher quality code than the C compiler."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "And so everything just got really fast."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "It was really easy."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "It was like, wow, I thought that was a sleazy hack because I was lazy."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "And in actual fact, it worked really well."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And I tried to convince people that that was maybe a good thesis topic."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And nobody was, it was like, nah."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "That's, I mean, it's kind of a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 5909, "text": "Or maybe you didn't have the, you weren't able to articulate the big picture of it."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "And I think that was a key part."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "But so then clock comes forward a few years."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "And it's like, we've got to be able to, if they want to be able to switch from this weird microprocessor to that weird and totally different microprocessor, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 5938, "text": "And I kind of went, oh, maybe by doing something kind of in the space of Pascal P code, I could do multiple translations to multiple translators."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And I spent some time thinking about that and thinking about what worked and what didn't work when I did the P code to Vax translator."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And I talked to some of the folks who were involved in Smalltalk because Smalltalk also did a bytecode."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "And then I kind of went, yeah, I want to do that."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Because that actually, and it had the other advantage that you could either interpret it or compile it."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "And interpreters are usually easier to do, but not as fast as a compiler."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "So I figured, good, I can be lazy again."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "Sometimes I think that most of my good ideas are driven by laziness."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "And often I find that some of people's stupidest ideas are because they're insufficiently lazy."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "They just want to build something really complicated."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "And it's like, it doesn't need to be that complicated."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "Yeah, and so that's how that came out."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "But that also turned into almost a religious position on my part, which got me in several other fights."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "So one of the things that was a real difference was the way that arithmetic worked."}, {"time": 6051, "text": "And once upon a time, it wasn't always just two's complement arithmetic."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "There were some machines that had one's complement arithmetic, which was like almost anything built by CDC."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "And occasionally, there were machines that were decimal arithmetic."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And I was like, this is crazy."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "Pretty much two's complement integer arithmetic has one."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So just do that."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "One of the other places where there was a lot of variability was in the way that floating point behaved."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "And that was causing people throughout the software industry much pain because you couldn't do a numerical computing library that would work on CDC and then have it work on an IBM machine and work on a DEC machine."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "And as a part of that whole struggle, there had been this big body of work on floating point standards."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "And this thing emerged that came to be called IEEE 754, which is the floating point standard that pretty much has taken over the entire universe."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And at the time I was doing Java, it had pretty much completed taking over the universe."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "There were still a few pockets of holdouts, but I was like, it's important to be able to say what two plus two means."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "And so I went that."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And one of the ways that I got into fights with people was that there were a few machines that did not implement IEEE 754 correctly."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "Well, of course, that's all short term kind of fights."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "I think in the long term, I think this vision is one out."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "Yeah, and I think it's worked out over time."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "I mean, the biggest fights were with Intel because they had done some strange things with rounding."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "They'd done some strange things with their transcendental functions, which turned into a mushroom cloud of weirdness."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "And in the name of optimization, but from the perspective of the developer, that's not good."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "Well, their issues with transcendental functions were just stupid."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "OK, so that's not even a trade off."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "That's just absolutely."},

he's done is he's taken a photograph where, you know, he's in it with someone else who turned out to be his ex wife."}, {"time": 911, "text": "So I'm thinking, well, this is awesome."}, {"time": 914,

go down to my, I go, I'm in my office, this is happening, right?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "So I go downstairs to one of my closest friends who is still actually one of my closest friends, who is one of my colleagues and Kevin."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "And I say, Kevin, and I go to Kevin, I go, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, he doesn't like the photograph."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And Kevin's like,

photograph?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "That's a horrible photograph."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "I'm like, yeah, but it's the only one that I had that was like, where my hair was kind of similar to what it is now, and he's like, Lisa, like, do I have to check everything for you?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "You should not have sent that, you know?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "But still, he flew over."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "So he flew."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "Where from, by the way?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "He was in graduate school at Amherst, yeah, at UMass Amherst."}, {"time":

dressed."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Were you nervous?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "I was really, really nervous."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Because I don't really believe in fate and I don't really

number of people who fit them is maybe less than."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I like it, mathematically speaking, yeah."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And so when I was going to pick him up at the airport,

very authentic and very moving and we really connected."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And I really felt like he understood me, actually, in a way that a lot of people don't."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And what was really nice was, at the time, you know, the airport was this tiny little airport out in a cornfield, basically."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And so driving back to the town, we were in the car for 15 minutes, completely in the dark, as I was driving."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And so it was very similar to, we had just spent, you know, 20 something hours on the telephone, sitting in the dark, talking to each other."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "So it was very familiar."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And we basically spent the whole weekend together and he met all my friends and we had a big party."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "And at the end of the weekend, I said, okay, you know, if we're gonna give this a shot, we probably shouldn't see other people."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So it's a risk, you know?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Commitment."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "But I just didn't see how it would work if we were dating people locally and then also seeing each other at a distance."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Because, you know, I've had long distance relationships before and they're hard and they take a lot of effort."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And so we decided we'd

the, could you speak to the stickiness?"}, {"time": 1223, "text": "Like to the, just the falling in love?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Like seeing that somebody really gets you?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Maybe by way of telling, do you think, do you remember there was a moment when you just realized, damn it, I think I'm, like I think this is the guy."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "I think I'm in love."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "We were having these conversations actually from the, really from the second weekend we were together."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "So he flew back the next weekend to State College because it was my birthday."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "It was my 30th birthday."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "My friends were throwing me a party."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "And we went hiking and we hiked up some mountain and we were sitting on a cliff over this overlook and talking to each other."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "And I was thinking, and I actually said to him, like I haven't really known you very long, but I feel like I'm falling in love with you, which can't possibly be happening."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I must be projecting, but it certainly feels that way."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Like I don't believe in love at first sight."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So this can't really be happening, but it sort of feels like it is."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And he was like, I know what you mean."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And so for the first three months or four months, we would say things to each other."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Like, I feel like I'm in love with you, but you know, but that can't, but things don't really work like that."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "So, but you know, so, and then it became a joke."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Like I feel like I'm in love with you."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And then eventually, you know, I think, but I think that was one moment where we were talking about just, you know, not just all the great aspirations you have or all the things, but also things you don't like about yourself, things that you're worried about, things that you're scared of."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And then I think that was sort of solidified the relationship."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "And then there was one weekend where we went to Maine in the winter, which I mean, I really love the beach always, but in the winter, particularly."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "Because it's just beautiful and calm and whatever."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And I also, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Like, so there's this grand majestic scene of, you know, this very powerful ocean and it's all these like beautiful blue grays and it's just stunning."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And so we

I can say is I have deep affection now for like tiny little babies in a way that I didn't really before because of the, I'm just so curious."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "But the actual process of the mechanisms of the wiring of the brain, the learning, all the magic of the neurobiology."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Yeah, and or something like, when you make eye contact with someone directly, sometimes you feel something, right?"}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Yeah, that's weird."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And what is that?"}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And so to me, that's not backing away from the moment."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "That's like expanding the moment."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "It's like, that's incredibly cool."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "You know, when I was, I'll just say that when I was in graduate school, I also was in therapy because it's almost a given that you're gonna be in therapy yourself if you're gonna become a therapist."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "And I had a deal with my therapist, which was that I could call timeout at any moment that I wanted to, as long as I was being responsible about it."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And I wasn't using it as a way to get out of something."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And he could tell me, no, he could decline and say, no, you're using this to get out of something."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "But I could call timeout

you?"}, {"time": 1949, "text": "I tend to have two modes."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "One is an engineer and one is a romantic."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "And I'm conscious of like, there's two rooms."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "You can go into the one, the engineer room."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "And I think that ruins the romance."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So I tend to, there's two rooms."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "One is the engineering room."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Think from first principles, how do we build the thing that creates this kind of behavior?"}, {"time": 1975,

then you get married the next night that you just this giant mess and you write a song and then you cry and then you send a bunch of texts and anger and whatever."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And

rooms and you go back between them."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "But I think the way you put it is quite poetic."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "I think you're much better at adulting with love than perhaps

cool thought experiment to look at adults and think like that used to be a baby."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "And then that's like a fully wired baby."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "And it's just walking around pretending to be like all serious and important, wearing a suit or something."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "But that used to be a baby."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And then you think of like the parenting and all the experiences they had."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Like it's cool to think of it that way."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "But then I start thinking like from a machine learning perspective."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "But once you're like the romantic moments, all that kind of stuff, all that falls away."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "I forget about all of that, I don't know."},

mean, if you're exposed to Western culture at all, you are exposed to the sort of idealized, stereotypic, romantic exchange."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And what does it mean to be romantic?"},

does it."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "I mean, it depends on the conversation that led up to that point."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "Depends how much, it's like the music, because you have a very, you're both from the, my experiences with you as a fan, you have both a romantic niche, but you have a very pragmatic, like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And there's something about a six way plug that cuts through the bullshit that connects to the human, like he understands who you are."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "That was the most romantic gift he could have given me because he knows me so well."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "He has a deep understanding of me, which is that I will sit and suffer and complain about the fact that I have to plug and unplug things."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "And I will bitch and moan until the cows come home, but it would never occur to me to go buy a bloody six way plug."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "Whereas for him, he bought it, he plugged it in, he arranged, he taped up all my wires, he made it like really usable."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And for me, that was the best present."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "It was the most romantic thing because he understood who I was and he did something very, or just the casual, like we moved into a house that we went from having a two car garage to a one car garage."},

2219, "text": "So I'm like, okay, you can park your car in the garage, it's fine."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Every day when it snows, he goes out and cleans my car."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "I never asked him to do it, he just does it because he knows that I'm cutting it really close in the morning, when we all used to go to work."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "I have a time to the second so that I can get up as late as possible, work out as long as possible, and make it into my office like a minute before my first meeting."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "And so if it snows unexpectedly or something, I'm screwed because now that's an added 10 or 15 minutes and I'm gonna be late."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Anyways, it's just these little tiny things."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "He's a really easygoing guy and he doesn't look like somebody who pays attention to detail."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "He doesn't fuss about detail, but he definitely pays attention to detail."}, {"time": 2273,

{"time": 2286, "text": "It is kind of hilarious that that is, the six way plug is the most fulfilling, richest display of romance in your life."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "That's what I mean about romance."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Romance is really, it's not all about chocolates and flowers and whatever."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "I mean, those are all nice too, but..."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "Sometimes it's about the six way plug."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So maybe one way I could ask before we talk about the details, you also have the author of another book as we talked about how emotions are made."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So it's interesting to talk about the process of writing."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "You mentioned you were in New York."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "What have you learned from writing these two books about the actual process of writing?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And maybe, I don't know what's the most interesting thing to talk about there."},

going to take you three years to write your book."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "That's the first thing I learned is that no matter how organized you are, it's always gonna take way longer than what you think in part because very few people make an outline and then just stick to it."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "Some of the topics really take on a life of their own and to some extent you wanna let them have their voice."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "You wanna follow leads until you feel satisfied that you've dealt with the topic appropriately."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "But that part is actually fun."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "It's not fun to feel like you're constantly behind the eight ball in terms of time."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "But it is the exploration and the foraging for information is incredibly fun."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "For me anyways, I found it really enjoyable."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "And if I wasn't also running a lab at the same time and trying to keep my family going, the whole thing would have just been fun."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "But I would say the hardest thing about, the most important thing I think I learned is also the hardest thing and that for me, which is knowing what to leave out."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "A really good storyteller knows what to leave out."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "In academic writing, you shouldn't leave

start, and I mean the final draft, I mean, I wrote three drafts of that book actually."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And the final draft, and then I had to cut by a third."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "I mean, it was like 150,000 words or something."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "And I had to cut it down to like 110."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "So obviously it's, I struggle with what to leave out."},

I just love these little essays."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "What's the topic of those essays?"}, {"time": 2532, "text": "They are, they're called familiar essays."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So the topics are like everyday topics, like mail, coffee, chocolate."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "I mean, just like, and what she does is she weaves her own experience."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "It's a little bit like these conversations that you're so good at curating, actually."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "You're weaving together history and philosophy and science and also personal reflections."},

like mail."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "Like that's really interesting."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And so I read these essays and then I wrote to her a little fan girl email."}, {"time": 2595, "text":

gave me a reading list of essays that I should read like writers."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And so I read them all."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And anyway, so I decided it would be a really good challenge for me to try to write something really brief where I could focus on one or two really fascinating tidbits of neuroscience, connect each one to something philosophical or like just a question about human nature."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "Do it in a really brief format without violating the validity of the science."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "That was a, I just set myself this, what I thought of as a really, really big challenge in part because it was an incredibly hard thing for me to do in the first book."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Yeah, we should say that this is, The Seven and a Half Lessons is a very short book."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "I mean, it's like it embodies brevity, right?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "The whole point throughout is just, I mean, you could tell that there's editing, like there's pain in trying to bring it as brief as possible, as clean as possible, yeah."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "Yeah, so it's, the way I think of it is, it's a little book of big science and big ideas."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Yeah, really big ideas in brief little packages."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "And I wrote it so that people could read it."}, {"time": 2689,

of every chapter was me talking to him about what, I would talk out loud about what I wanted to say and the order in which I wanted to say it."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "And then I would write it and then he would read it and tell me all the bits that could be excised."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And sometimes we would, I should say, I mean, we don't, he and I don't really argue about much except directions in the car."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Like if we're gonna have an argument, that's gonna be where it's gonna happen, where."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "What's the nature of the argument about directions exactly?"}, {"time": 2810, "text": "I don't really know, it's just that we're very, I think it's that spatially, I use egocentric space."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So I wanna say, turn left."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "Like I'm reasoning in relation to my own physical corporeal body."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "So you walk to the church and you turn left and you, then whatever, I'm always like, and he gives directions allocentrically, which means organized around north, south, east, west."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So to you, the earth is at the center of the solar system and to him, reasonably."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "I'm at the center."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "You're at the center of the solar system."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "Anyway, but here, we had some really riproaring arguments, like really riproaring arguments where he would say, like, who is this for?"}, {"time": 2861, "text": "Is this for the 1%?"}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And I'd be like, 1% meaning not wealth, but like civilians versus academics."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "Are these for the scientists or is this for the civilians, right?"}, {"time": 2874, "text": "So he speaks for the people, for the civilians."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "He speaks for the people and I'd be like, no, you have to."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And so he made, after one terrible argument that we had where it was really starting to affect our relationship because we were so mad at each other all the time, he made these little signs, writing and science."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "And we only use them, this was like, when you pulled out a sign, that's it."}, {"time": 2900, "text": "Like the other person just wins and you have to stop fighting about it and that's it."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And so we just did that."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "And we didn't really have to use it too much for this book because this book was in some ways, I didn't have to learn a lot of new things for this book."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "I had to learn some, but a lot of what I learned for How Emotions Are Made really stood me in good stead for this book."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So there was a little bit, each essay was a little bit of learning."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "A couple were, was a little more than the small amount."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "But I didn't have so much trouble here."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "I had a lot of trouble with the first book."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "But still even here, he would tell me that I could take something out and I really wanted to keep it."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "And I think we only use the signs once."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book, I would love that."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Can we talk about, so one of the essays looks at evolution."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It looks at evolution."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Let me ask the big question."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "Did the human brain evolve to think?"}, {"time": 2973, "text": "That's essentially the question that you address in the essay."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "The big caveat here is that we don't really know why brains evolved."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "The big why questions are called teleological questions."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "And in general, scientists should avoid those questions because we don't know really why, we don't know the why."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "However, for a very long time, the assumption was that evolution worked in a progressive upward scale, that you start off with simple organisms and those organisms get more complex and more complex and more complex."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "Now, obviously that's true in some like really general way, right, that life started off as single cell organisms and things got more complex."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "But the idea that brains evolved in some upward trajectory from simple brains in simple animals to complex brains in complex animals is called a phylogenetic scale."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "And that phylogenetic scale is embedded in a lot of evolutionary thinking, including Darwin's actually."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And it's been seriously challenged, I would say, by modern evolutionary biology."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And so thinking is something that, rationality is something that humans, at least in the West, really prize as a great human achievement."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story is that brains evolved in like sedimentary rock with a layer for instincts, that's your lizard brain, and a layer on top of that for emotions, that's your limbic system, limbic meaning border."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So it borders the parts that are for instincts."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And then the neocortex or new cortex where rationality is supposed to live."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "That's the sort of traditional story."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "It just keeps getting layered on top by evolution."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "And so you can think about, I mean, sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "The way I sometimes like to think about it is thinking about the cerebral cortex like icing on an already baked cake, where the cake is your inner beast."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions that have to be contained by the cortex."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "And it's just, it's a fiction, it's a myth."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "It's a myth that you can trace all the way back to stories about morality in ancient Greece."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "But what you can do is look at the scientific record and say, well, there are other stories that you could tell about brain evolution and the context in which brains evolved."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "So when you look at creatures who don't have brains and you look at creatures who do, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "And you can look at some animals."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "So we call, scientists call an environment that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "What are the things, what are the parts of the environment that matter to that animal?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "And so there are some animals whose niche hasn't changed in 400 million years."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "So they're not, these creatures are modern creatures but they're living in a niche that hasn't changed much."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "And so their biology hasn't changed much."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes that lurk deep in the molecular structure of cells."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And so you can, by looking at various animals in their developmental state, meaning not, you don't look at adult animals, you look at embryos of animals and developing animals, you can see, you can piece together a different story."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And that story is that brains evolved under the selection pressure of hunting."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "That in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene where animals deliberately ate one another."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And what, so before the Cambrian period, the animals didn't really have, well, they didn't have brains, but they also didn't have senses really, the very, very rudimentary senses."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons is called an amphioxus or a lancelet."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "And little amphioxus has no eyes, it has no ears, it has no nose, it has no eyes."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark for circadian rhythm purposes."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And it can't hear, it has a vestibular cell to keep its body upright."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It has a very rudimentary sense of touch and it doesn't really have any internal organs other than this like basically stomach."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "It's like a, just like a, it doesn't have an enteric nervous system."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "It doesn't have like a gut that moves like we do."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "It just has basically a tube."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "So it's like a little container, yeah."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "And so, and really it doesn't move very much."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "It can move, it just sort of wriggles."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "It doesn't have very sophisticated movement."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "And it's this really sweet little animal."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "It sort of wriggles its way to a spot and then plants itself in the sand and just filters food as the food goes by."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And then when the food concentration decreases, it just ejects itself, wriggles to some spot randomly where probabilistically there will be more food and plants itself again."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "So it's not really aware, very aware that it has an environment."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "It has a niche, but that niche is very small and it's not really experiencing that niche very much."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "So it's basically like a little stomach on a stick."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "That's really what it is."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And, but when animals start to literally hunt each other, all of a sudden it becomes important to have, to be able to sense your environment."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Cause you need to know, is that blob up ahead gonna eat me or should I eat it?"}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And so all of a sudden you want, distance senses are very useful."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "And so in the water, distance senses are vision and a little bit hearing."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "Olfaction, smelling and touch, because in the water touch is a distance sense cause you can feel the vibration, so it's right."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So on land, you know, vision is a distance sense, touch not so much, but for elephants maybe, right?"}, {"time": 3418, "text": "The vibrations."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "Vibrations, olfaction definitely because of the distance sense."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "And so it's very important to have a sense of touch and olfaction definitely because of the concentration of, you know, the more concentrated something is, the more likely it is to be close to you."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "So animals developed senses."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "They developed a head, like a literal head."}, {"time": 3440, "text": "So amphyoxus doesn't even have a head really."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "It's just a long."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "What's the purpose of a head?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Is it to have a jaw?"}, {"time": 3450, "text": "So jaw, so yes, jaws are a major."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "Useful feature."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Yeah, obviously they're a major adaptation after there's a split between vertebrates and invertebrates."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So amphyoxus is thought to be very, very similar to the animal that's before that split."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "But then after the development, very quickly after the development of a head is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "And what goes along with that is the development of a brain."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "It's weird, is that just a coincidence that the thing, the part of our body, of the mammal, I think, body that we eat with and attack others with is also the thing that contains all the majority of the brain type of stuff."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "Well, actually the brain goes with the development of a head and the development of a visual system and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "So your senses are developing and the other thing that's happening is that animals are getting bigger because they're, and also their niche is getting bigger."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Well, this is the, just sorry to take a tiny tangent on the niche thing is it seems like the niche is getting bigger, but not just bigger, like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "So predation seems to create, the whole world becomes your oyster, whatever, but you also start to carve out the places in which you can operate the best."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "Yeah, and in fact, that's absolutely right."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind, your ability to make inferences about the inner life of other creatures actually developed under the selection pressure of predation because it makes you a better predator."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Do you ever look at, you just said you looked at babies as these wiring creatures."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "Do you ever think of humans as just clever predators?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Like that there's, underneath it all is this the Nietzschean will to power in all of its forms?"}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Or are we now friendlier?"}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Yeah, so it's interesting."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "I mean, there are zeitgeists in how humans think about themselves, right?"}, {"time": 3599, "text": "And so if you look in the 20th century, you can see that the idea of an inner beast that we're just predators, we're just basically animals, baseless animals, violent animals that have to be contained by culture and by our prodigious neocortex really took hold, particularly after World War I, and really held sway for much of that century."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say, you know, we're talking mainly about Western scientific writing, Western philosophical writing."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And then, you know, late 90s maybe, you start to see books and articles about our social nature, that we're social animals."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And we are social animals, but what does that mean exactly?"}, {"time": 3657, "text": "And about."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "It's us carving out different niches in the space of ideas, it looks like."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "I think so, I think so."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "So, you know, do humans, can humans be violent?"}, {"time": 3675, "text": "Can humans be really helpful?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And humans are interesting creatures because, you know, other animals can also be helpful to one another."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "In fact, there's a whole literature, booming literature on how other animals support one another."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "They regulate each other's nervous systems in interesting ways, and they will be helpful to one another, right?"}, {"time": 3703, "text": "So for example, there's a whole literature on rodents and how they signal one another what is safe to eat, and they will perform acts of generosity to their conspecifics that are related to them, or who they were raised with."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "So if an animal was raised in a litter that they were raised in, although not even at the same time, they'll be more likely to help that animal."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So there's always some kind of physical relationship between animals that predicts whether or not they'll help one another."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "For humans, you know, we have ways of categorizing who's in our group and who isn't by nonphysical ways, right?"}, {"time": 3752, "text": "Even by just something abstract, like an idea."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "And we are much more likely to extend help to people in our own group, whatever that group may be at that moment, whatever feature you're using to do that."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Feature you're using to define who's in your group and who isn't."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "We're more likely to help those people than even members of our own family at times."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So humans are much more flexible in their, in the way that they help one another, but also in the way that they harm one another."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "So I don't think I subscribe to, I don't think I subscribe to, you know, we are primarily this or we are primarily that."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "I don't think humans have essences in that way, really."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "I apologize to take us in this direction for a brief moment, but I've been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently in terms of reading."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And is there something that you think about in terms of the nature of evil from a neuroscience perspective?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "Is there some lessons that are sort of hopeful about human civilization that we can find in our brain with regard to the Hitlers of the world?"}, {"time": 3841, "text": "Do you think about the nature of evil?"}, {"time": 3847, "text": "I don't know that what I have to say is so useful from a, I don't know that I can say as a neuroscientist, well, here's a study that, you know, so I sort of have to take off my lab coat, right?"}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And now I'm gonna now conjecture as a human who just also, who has opinions, but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "It's just, the question is really how much encouragement does it take from the environment to get them to do something bad?"}, {"time": 3911, "text": "That's what I kind of, when I look at the life of Hitler, it seems like there's so many places where... Something could have intervened."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "Intervene, no, it could change completely the person."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "I mean, there's like the caricature, like the obvious places where he was an artist and if he wasn't rejected as an artist, he was a reasonably good artist."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So that could have changed, but just his entire, like where he went in Vienna and all these kinds of things, like little interactions could have changed and there's probably millions of other people who are capable, who the environment may be able to mold in the same way it did this particular person to create this particular kind of charismatic leader in this particular moment of time."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "Absolutely, and I guess the way that I would say it, I would agree 100% and I guess the way that I would say it is like this, in the West, we have a way of reasoning about causation, which focuses on single, simple causes for things."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "There's an essence to Hitler, there's an essence to his character."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "He was born with that essence or it was forged very, very early in his life and that explains the horrible landscape of his behavior."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "But there's another way to think about it, a way that actually is much more consistent with what we know about biology, how biology works in the physical world."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "And that is that most things are complex, not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard, but complex as in complexity, that is more than the sum of their parts and that most phenomena have many, many weak nonlinear interacting causes."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And so little things that we might not even be aware of can shift someone's developmental trajectory from this to that and that's enough to take it on a whole set of other paths and that these things are happening all the time."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "So it's not random and it's not really, it's not deterministic in the sense that like everything you do determines your outcome, but it's a little more like you're nudging someone from one set of possibilities to another set of possibilities."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "But I think the thing that I find optimistic is that the other side of that coin is also true."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "So look at all the people who risked their lives to help people they didn't even know."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "And the thing that I came away with, but the thing I came away with was, look at how generous people were in that."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Oh, he's making, there are a lot of people he makes fun of and that's fine, but think about like those two people two guys, those."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "The Trump supporter guys."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Those guys."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "That was cool, there was kindness in them, right?"}, {"time": 4113, "text": "They took a complete stranger in a pandemic into their house."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "Who does that?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Like that's a really nice thing."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "Or there's one scene, I mean, I don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but there's one scene where he goes in, he dresses up as a Jew, I laugh myself sick at that scene, seriously, but he goes in and there are these two old Jewish ladies."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "What a bunch of sweethearts, oh my gosh."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "Like really, I mean, that was what I was struck by actually."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter, right?"}, {"time": 4155, "text": "I mean, she was really kind."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "And yeah, so that's really what I was more struck by."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Like sure, there are other people who do very bad things or say bad things or whatever, but like there's one guy who's completely stoic, like the guy who's sending the messages, I don't know if it's facts or whatever."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "He's just completely stoic, but he's doing his job actually."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "Like you don't know what he was thinking inside his head, you don't know what he's feeling, but he was totally professional doing his job."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So I guess I just, I had a bit of a different view, I guess."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "So I also think that about people, I think everybody is capable of kindness, but the question is how much does it take and what are the circumstances?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "So for some people it's gonna take a lot and for some people it only takes a little bit, but are we actually cultivating an environment for the next generation that provides opportunities for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness or, and I'm not saying that as like a Pollyanna ish person."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "I think there's a lot of room for competition and debate and so on, but I don't see Hitler as an anomaly and I never have, that was even before I learned anything about neuroscience."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "And now I would say knowing what we know about developmental trajectories and life histories and how important that is, knowing what we know about that the whole question of like nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "We have the kind of nature that requires nurture, we have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born with unfinished brains where the brains, their brains are wired across a 25 year period with wiring instructions from the world that is created for them."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And so I don't think Hitler is an anomaly, even if it's less probable that that would happen, it's possible that it could happen again and it's not like, you know, he's a bad seed."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "I mean, that doesn't, I just wanna say for like, of course he's completely 100% responsible for his actions and all the bad things that happen."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "So I'm not in any way, this is not me saying."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "But the environment is also responsible in part for creating the evil in this world."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "So like Hitler's in different versions of even more subtle, more smaller scale versions of evil."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But I tend to believe that there's a much stronger, I don't like to talk about evolutionary advantages, but it seems like it makes sense for love to be a more powerful emergent phenomena of our collective intelligence versus hate and evil and destruction."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "Because from a survival, from a niche perspective, it seems to be like in my own life and my thinking about the intuition about the way humans work together to solve problems, it seems that love is a very useful tool."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "I definitely agree with you."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "But I think the caveat here is that, you know, humans, the research suggests that humans are capable of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity to people in their in group."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "Right, so we're also tribal."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's the kitschy way to say it."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "We're tribes, we're tribal, yeah."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So that's the kitschy way to say it."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "What I would say is that, you know,

have to confirm you wanna be added to the group."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "What it also did was posted it on their walls to increase engagement."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And what they inadvertently

of them, like one in a thousand."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "And the reason is it's jet fuel."}, {"time": 5553, "text": "You only want to take that money if you really want to build something big and you want to build it fast."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "And when you put jet fuel behind a startup, as we've seen with other rockets, things can blow up and people can die."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "You know, it's not people literally dying, but the business can go up in smoke, right?"}, {"time": 5569, "text": "Like rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX as part of their ambitious plans."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in, go to zero."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "Now, if you were to start the business and only build it off customer revenue and use your own money and go nice and slow and grow 10% a year, the chances of you blowing up the rocket are very low because you're riding a bicycle."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "You can go a little faster, but the bicycle can only go so fast."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "And once you start taking that money, the way venture capital is constructed as in the mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is, you know, we're going to put some money into safe things and then we're going to have these really binary things over here."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "It's grown to 20% just as a function of how successful it's been."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "So, you know, the Harvards of the world and MIT is probably want five or 10% in venture, but it's grown to 25% because, you know, companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "But the goal is in these venture funds, we're going to invest in 30 names and one or two of them are going to return three times the capital we've deployed."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "So it's a $300 million fund and there's 30 names and they each got 10 million."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "That means one of the 10 million is going to return the fund plus."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So that means it has to grow 30X and then 60X to double the fund."}, {"time": 5657, "text": "And you're really supposed to be doing three times cash on cash."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "So that $300 million funds, the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 million, triple the person's money as opposed to the stock market, which doubles your money in the same period."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "So you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns in order to triple the money."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "And maybe I have an outlying chance of four or five times the money, which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "And what that means is the venture capitalist behavior in the game they're playing is different than you as the founder."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You as the founder, you may really care about this and it dying really matters to you."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And then you got a venture capitalist who's like, we're betting on 30 names, we need two of them to hit it out of the park, maybe three, and nothing else is meaningful."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "So now you start thinking about the game theory there."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "You're dealing with money that is coming in that only cares about you going 100X."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "It's a whole different ball game."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "And if you look at a company like com.com, we invested at 5 million, the next round they did was 250."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "They were so capital efficient that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue to millions of dollars a month in revenue over those four years since we invested and they didn't raise money in between."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "It was unbelievable."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "And I've only seen this happen three or four times."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So it doesn't happen all this capital efficient meaning based on customer revenue alone plus some small amount of fundraising, you're able to go."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Like how hard is it to do that?"}, {"time": 5749, "text": "It takes extreme product market fit."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "You have to have a great price for your product that has a great margin."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "Yeah, and if you're doing something in hardware, it's probably impossible because it's super capital intensive."}, {"time": 5761, "text": "So it's probably gotta be a software business."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "Hardware businesses take a lot more."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "Do venture capitals get in the way at all of the business or is it possible to get out of the way?"}, {"time": 5771, "text": "Yeah, if you get young venture capitalists who are starting their career, they're very nervous and scared because they're putting all these bets."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "And then there's a very weird thing that happens."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "The bad news comes first."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "So companies that don't work out go out of business immediately."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So if it's not gonna be Com or Robinhood or Uber, you know you have one of those great successes somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "What is the first five years like?"}, {"time": 5800, "text": "First five years, you feel like an idiot."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "Let's say you make these 10 bets."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "In year two, two or three of them come back and they don't have product market fit and they're out of money."}, {"time": 5811, "text": "And they say, can we have more money?"}, {"time": 5812, "text": "You say, no, we have to go get it from somebody else because you have to prove that there's still a market for it."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "We may keep our pro rata."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "We may put a little bit in to maintain our percentage ownership, but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And that company dies."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "So now you've got 10 million, poof, up in smoke."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Boom, 10 million up in smoke."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So this is called the J curve where your performance goes down."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "And then it's only in years four or five and six it starts going up."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "And what you're seeing right now is the people who started like I did in 2000, you know, just 11, 12 years ago."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "In 2009, I started investing."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "We all look like geniuses."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "We're at the end of the cycle."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "We invested after when the stock market was on the floor after the financial crisis."}, {"time": 5854, "text": "And it's gone straight up since."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "So everybody looked, there's a couple of little blips in there, but generally speaking, there hasn't been like a major crash with the exception of the pandemic crash, but that bounced right back."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "And so, you know, it takes a decade to figure out if you're good at it."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And then if the market crashes again, everybody feels like an idiot again, the cycle starts again."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "So you are now as a founder, you are now inserting yourself into that casino."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "And now you've got all these other forces pushing and pulling."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "And you're growing, let's say your company was growing 50%."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "You feel like, wow, I'm successful."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "I made a million dollars last year."}, {"time": 5885, "text": "Now I'm doing a million and a half."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "And the first thing a VC is gonna say to you is, how do we triple?"}, {"time": 5890, "text": "We're growing too slow."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "See, but that's, like you said, that beautifully is a rocket fuel."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "It's, in a sense, it's a kind of motivation."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "It's a drive."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "I

that there's a scapegoat, that there's this kind of thing naturally leads to a conflict and then they find the other, some group that's the other that's either real or artificial as the cause of the conflict."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "Well, it's always artificial because the cause of the conflict in Gerard is the mimesis of desire itself."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And how do we attack that?"},

sense."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "That worked for a while."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "Now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster, the unrenewable use of resource and turning those

popular view for where the origin of life happened on Earth is hydrothermal vents because they had sufficient energy."}, {"time": 285, "text": "And so we don't really know a lot about early Earth."}, {"time": 290, "text": "We have some ideas about when oceans first formed and things like that, but the time of the origin of life is kind of not well understood or pinned down and the conditions on Earth at that time are not well known."}, {"time": 302, "text": "But a lot of people do think that there was probably hydrothermal vents which are really hot, chemically active regions, say on the seafloor in modern times, which also would have been present on early Earth."}, {"time": 314, "text": "And they would have provided energy and organics and basically all of the right conditions for the origins of life, which is one of the reasons that we look for these hydrothermal systems when we're talking about life elsewhere too."}, {"time": 327, "text": "Okay, and for the genetic code, the idea is that the RNA is the first, like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it's life?"}, {"time": 337, "text": "I guess the idea is it could both have persistent information and then it can also do some of the work of like what, creating a self sustaining organism?"}, {"time": 349, "text": "Yeah, that's the basic idea."}, {"time": 350, "text": "So the idea is you have, in an RNA molecule, you have a sequence of characters, say, so you can treat it like a string in a computer and it can be copied."}, {"time": 360, "text": "So information can be propagated, which is important for evolution because evolution happens by having inheritance of information."}, {"time": 369, "text": "So for example, like my eyes are brown because my mother's eyes were brown."}, {"time": 373, "text": "So you need that copying of information, but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis, which means that that RNA molecule is not inert in that environment, but it actually interacts with something and could potentially mediate, say, a metabolism that could then fuel the actual reproduction of that molecule."}, {"time": 395, "text": "So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you the most bang for your buck in a single molecule and therefore, it gives you all the features that you might think are life."}, {"time": 409, "text": "And so this is sort of where this

that's a separate story."}, {"time": 460, "text": "And then the other one is actually something I agree with, which is that you can say there was an RNA world because RNA was the first genetic material for life on Earth."}, {"time": 470, "text": "So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms that had genetics in a modern sense, didn't have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA, right?"},

that happened on Earth, say almost 4 billion years ago, because we have evidence of life emerging very early on our planet."}, {"time": 542, "text": "And then an origin of life event, quote unquote, a singular event, whatever that was, happened."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And then all life on Earth that we know is a descendant of that particular event in our universe, right?"}, {"time": 554, "text":

the exchange of life between planets being the explanation is once you start removing the original life from Earth, you know even less about it than you do if you study it on Earth."}, {"time": 636,

650, "text": "And there's a more tractable general problem of how does it happen?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "And how does it happen is something we can actually ask in the lab."}, {"time": 658, "text": "How did it happen on early Earth is a much more detailed and nuanced question and requires detailed knowledge of what was happening on early Earth that we don't have."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And I'm personally more interested in general mechanisms."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So to me, it doesn't matter if it happened on Earth or it happened on Mars."}, {"time": 675, "text": "It just matters that it happened."}, {"time": 676, "text": "We have evidence it happened."}, {"time": 678, "text": "The question is, did it happen more than once in our universe?"}, {"time": 681, "text": "And so the reason I don't find panspermia as a particularly, I think it's a fascinating hypothesis."}, {"time": 688, "text": "I definitely think it's possible."}, {"time": 690, "text": "And I in particular think it's possible once you get to the stage of life where you have technology because then you obviously can spread out into the cosmos."}, {"time": 700, "text": "But it's also possible for microbes because we know that certain microorganisms can survive the journey in space."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And they can live in a rock and go between Mars and Earth."}, {"time": 710, "text": "Like people have done experiments to try to prove that could work."}, {"time": 714, "text": "So in that scenario, it's super cool because then you get planetary exchange, but say we go look for life on Mars and it ends up being exactly the same life we have on Earth, biochemically speaking, then we haven't really discovered something new about the universe."}, {"time": 726, "text": "What kind of aliens are possible were there other origin of life events?"}, {"time": 730, "text": "If we find, if all the life we ever find is the same origin of life event in the universe, it doesn't help me solve my problem."}, {"time": 736, "text": "But it's possible that that would be a sign that you could separate the environment from the basic ingredients."}, {"time": 745, "text": "So you can have like a life gun that you shoot throughout the universe."}, {"time": 750, "text": "And then like once you shoot it, it's like the Simpsons with a makeup gun."}, {"time": 754, "text": "That was a great episode."},

reduces the barrier of like the time it takes, the luck it takes to actually, from nothing, from the basic chemistry, from the basic physics of the universe for the life to spring up."}, {"time": 778, "text": "Yeah, I think this is actually super important to just think about, like does life getting seated on a planet have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "So you're suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space and like life could go to Mars and then it would just live there and be happy there."}, {"time": 796, "text": "But that's actually an open question."}, {"time": 798, "text": "So one of the things I was gonna say in response to your question about whether the origin of life happened once or multiple times, is for me personally right now in my thinking, although this changes on a weekly basis, but is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomenon."}, {"time": 811, "text": "So I think the origin of life because life is so intimately tied to planetary cycles and planetary processes, and this goes all the way back through the history of our planet, that the origin of life itself grew out of geochemistry and became coupled and controlled geochemistry."}, {"time": 826, "text": "And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet is when we have evidence of life actually influencing properties of the planet."}, {"time": 835, "text": "And so if life is a planetary property, then going to Mars is not a trivial thing because you basically have to make Mars more Earth like."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And so in some sense, like when I think about sort of longterm vision of humans in space, for example, really what you're talking about when you're saying, let's send our civilization to Mars is you're not saying let's send our civilization to Mars, you're saying let's reproduce our planet on Mars."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Like the information from our planet actually has to go to Mars and make Mars more Earth like, which means that you're now having a reproduction process, like a cell reproduces itself to propagate information in the future."}, {"time": 872, "text": "Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions, including geochemical conditions on other planets in order to actually reproduce life in the universe, which is kind of a little bit radical, but I think for longterm sustainability of life on a planet, that's absolutely essential."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Okay, so if we were to think about life as a planetary phenomena, and so life on Mars would be best if it's way different than life on Earth, we have to ask the very basic question of what is life?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "I actually don't think that's the right question to ask."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It took me a long time to get there, right?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "So I... Cross it out."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Yeah, cross it off your list, it's wrong."}, {"time": 913, "text": "No, no, no, I mean, I think it has an answer, but I think the part of the problem is, you know, most of the places in science where we get really stuck is because we don't know what questions to ask."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And so you can't answer a question if you're asking the wrong question."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And I think the way I think about it is obviously I'm interested in what life is."}, {"time": 931, "text": "So I'm being a little cheeky when I say that's the wrong question to ask."}, {"time": 933, "text": "That's exactly like the question that's like the core of my existence."}, {"time": 936, "text": "But I think the way of framing that is what is it about our universe that allows features that we associate life to be there?"}, {"time": 947, "text": "And so really what I guess when I'm asking that question, what I'm after is an explanatory framework for what life is, right?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "And so most people, they try to go in and define life and they say, well, life is say, a self reproducing chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution."}, {"time": 962, "text": "That's a very popular definition for life."}, {"time": 965, "text": "Or life is something that metabolizes and eats."}, {"time": 968, "text": "That is not how I think about life."}, {"time": 970, "text": "What I think about life is there are principles and laws that govern our universe that we don't understand yet, that have something to do with how information interacts with the physical world."}, {"time": 983, "text": "I don't know exactly what I mean even when I say that, because we don't know these rules, but it's a little bit like, I like to use analogies."}, {"time": 992, "text": "You give me time to be like a little long winded for a second, even in as I, but sort of like if you look at the history of physics, for example, this is like, so we are in the period of the development of thought on our planet where we don't understand what we are yet."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "There was a period of thought in the history of our planet where we didn't understand what gravity was."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And we didn't understand, for example, that planets in the heavens were actually planets or that they operated by the same laws that we did."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And so there has been this sort of progression of getting a deeper understanding of explaining basic phenomena."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Like, I'm not gonna drop the cup."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "I'll drop the water bottle."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Okay, that fell, right?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "But why did that fall?"}, {"time": 1036, "text": "This is why I'm a theorist, not an experimentalist."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "That could have gone wrong in so many ways."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "I know, it could have, especially if I did the cup and it smashed."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So if you take this view that there's sort of some missing principles, I associate them to information."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And what the sort of feeling there is, there's some missing explanatory framework for how our universe works."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "And if we understood that physics, it would explain what we are."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "It might also explain a lot of other features we don't associate to life."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And so it's a little like people accept the fact that gravity is a universal phenomena."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "But when we wanna study gravity, we study things like large scale, galactic structures or black holes or planets."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "If we wanna understand information and how it operates in the physical world, we study intelligent systems or living systems because they are the manifestation of that physics."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And the fact that we can't see that clearly yet, or we don't have that explanatory framework, I think it's just because we haven't been thinking about the problem deeply enough."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "But I feel like if you're explaining something, you're deriving it from some more fundamental property."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And of course, I have to say I'm wearing my physicist hat."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So I have a huge bias of liking simple, elegant explanations of the universe that really are compelling."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "But I think one of the things that I've sort of maybe in some ways rejected my training as a physicist is that most of the elegant explanations that we have so far don't include us in the universe."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And I can't help but think there's something really special about what we are."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And there have to be some deep principles at play there."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And so that's sort of my perspective on it."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Now, when you ask me what life is, I have some ideas of what I think it is, but I think that we haven't gotten there yet because we haven't been able to see that structure."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And just to go back to the gravity example, it's a little like in ancient times, they didn't know, I was talking about stars and heavens and things."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "They didn't know those were governed by the same principles as that darned experiment."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "Here's where I was going with it."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Once you realize, like Newton did, that heavenly motions and earthly motions are governed by the same principles and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion, you get these more powerful ideas."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "And I think where life is is somehow unifying these abstract ideas of computation and information with the physical world, with matter, and realizing that there's some explanatory framework that's not physics and it's not computation, but it's something that's deeper."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So answering the question of what is life requires deeply understanding something about the universe as information processing, the universe is computation."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "It's something about, like would, once you come up with an answer to what is life, will the words information and computation be in the paragraph that answer?"}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Oh, damn it, okay."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "I know, it doesn't help, does it?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I know, I hate, actually I hate this about what I do because it's so hard to communicate, right, with words."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Like when you have words that are ideas that have historically described one thing and you're trying to describe something people haven't seen yet, and the words just don't fit."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "So what's wrong, is it too ambiguous, the word information?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "We could switch to binary if you want."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Yeah, no, I don't think it's binary either."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "I think information's just loaded."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "I use it, so the other way I might talk about it is the physics of causation, but I think that's worse because causation is even more loaded word than information."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "So causation is fundamental, you think?"}, {"time": 1248, "text": "I do, yeah, and in some sense, I think the physics, so this is the really radical part, some sense, like when I really think about it sort of most deeply, what I think life is is actually the physics of existence, what gets to exist and why."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "And for simple elementary particles, that's not very complicated because the interactions are simple, but for things like you and me and human civilizations, what comes next in the universe is really dependent on what came before, and there's a huge space of possibilities of things that can exist."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And when I say information and causation, what I mean is why is it that cups evolved in the universe and not some other object that could deliver water and not spill it?"}, {"time": 1289, "text": "I don't know what you would call it."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Maybe it wouldn't be a cup, but it's a huge, people talk about the space of things that could exist as being actually infinitely large, right?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "I don't know if I believe in infinity, but I do think that there is something very interesting about the problem of what exists in its relationship to life."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So do you think the set of things that could exist is finite?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "It's very large, but if we were to think about the physics of existence, how many shapes of mugs can there be?"}, {"time": 1328, "text": "In the initial programming."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I should go to the math department for that."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So that's not a topology question."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "I just mean, maybe another way to ask is what do you think is fundamental to the universe and what is emergent?"}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So if existence, are we supposed to think of that as somehow fundamental, you think?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "So there's a couple of problems in physics that I think this is related to."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "One is why does mathematics work at describing reality so well?"}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And then there is this problem of we don't understand why the laws of physics are the way they are, or why certain things get to exist, or what put in place the initial condition of our universe."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "There's all of these sort of really deep and big problems, and they all indirectly are related, I think, to the same kind of thing that, our physics is really good if you specify the initial condition at specifying a certain sequence of events, but it doesn't deal with the fact that other things could have happened, which is kind of an informational property, like a counterfactual property."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And it's not good at explaining this conversation right now."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "There are certain things that are outside the explanatory reach of current physics, and I think they require looking at it from a completely different direction."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And so I don't wanna have to fine tune the initial condition of the universe to specify precisely all the information in this conversation."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "I think that's a ridiculous assertion."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "But that's sort of like how people wanna frame it when they talk about the standard model is sufficient if we had computing power to basically explain all of life in our existence."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "An interesting thing you said is the way we think about information computation is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth that exhibit something we think of as intelligence."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "But that's like looking at, I guess, the tip of an iceberg, and we should be really looking at the fundamentals of the iceberg, like what makes water and ice and the chemistry from which intelligence emerges, essentially."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "We can't just couple the information from the physics, and I think that's what we've gotten really good at doing, especially with sort of the modern age where software is so abstracted from hardware."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "But the entire process of biological evolution has basically been built, like been building layers of increasing abstraction."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And so it's really hard to see that physics in us, but it's much clearer to see it in molecules."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Yeah, but I guess I'm trying to figure out what do you think are the best tools to look at it?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "An open mind?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Is that a tool?"}, {"time": 1493, "text": "What's the physics of an open mind?"}, {"time": 1496, "text": "I think if we solve that, we'll solve everything."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "I'm saying an open mind because I think the biggest stumbling block to understanding sort of the things I've been trying to articulate, and when I talk also with colleagues that are thinking deeply about these same issues, is none of it is inconsistent with what we know."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "It's just such a radically different perception of the way we understand things now that it's hard for people to get there."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And in some ways you have to almost forget what you've learned in order to learn something new, right?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So I feel like most of my career trying to understand the problem of life has been variously forgetting and then relearning things that I learned in physics."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And I think you have to have a capacity to learn things, but then accept that things that you learned might not be true or might need refinement or reframing."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And the best way I can say that is just like with a physics education, there are just certain things you're told in undergrad that are like facts about the world."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And your physics professors never tell you that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So we're taught to think about, say the laws of physics, for example, as this like autonomous thing that exists outside of our universe and tells our universe how it works."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "But the laws of physics were invented by human minds to describe things that are regularities in our everyday experience."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "They don't exist autonomous to the universe."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "Right, so it's like turtles on top of turtles, but eventually it gets to the human mind, and then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So you have to, it comes from humans, this understanding, this simplification of the universe, these models."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "There's a guy named Stephen Wolfram."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "There's a concept called cellular automata."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "So there's some mysteries in these systems that are computational in nature that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries we should need to solve to understand what is life."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "So if we could talk, take a computational view of things, do you think there's something compelling to reducing everything down to computation, like the universe is computation, and then trying to understand life?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry, throw away even the physics that you learn undergrad and graduate school, and more look at these simple little systems, whether it's cellular automata or whatever the heck kind of computational systems that operate on simple local rules and then create complexity as they evolve."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Is it at all, do you think, productive to focus on those kinds of systems to get an inkling of what is life?"}, {"time": 1664, "text": "And if it is, do you think it's possible to come up with some kind of laws and principles about what makes life in those computational systems?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "So I like cellular automata."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "I think they're good toy models, but mostly where I've thought about them and used them is to actually, let's say, poke at sort of the current conceptual framework that we have and see where the flaws are."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So I think the part that you're talking about that people find intriguing is that if you have a fairly simple rule and you specify some initial condition and you run that rule on that initial condition, you could get really complex patterns emerging."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "And ooh, doesn't that look lifelike?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Well, it's like really surprising, isn't it really surprising?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "It is really surprising, and they're beautiful."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And I think they have a lot of nice features associated to them."}, {"time": 1719,

principle about some of the ways that we might think of computation as being sort of a fundamental principle for dynamical systems and maybe the evolution of the universe as a whole, they're a great model system."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "As an explanatory framework for life, I think they're a bit problematic for the same reason that the laws of physics are a bit problematic."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And the clearest way I can articulate that is like cellular automata are actually cast in sort of a conceptual framework for how the universe should be described that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact, with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion, which exists sort of, it's given to you."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "The great programmer in the sky gave you this equation or this rule, and then you just run with it."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "And the rule doesn't have, so a good feature of the rule is it doesn't have specified in the rule information about the patterns it generates."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "So you wouldn't want, for example, my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here to be specified in the laws of physics."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "That would be ridiculous because it wouldn't be a very simple explanation of all the things happening."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "It'd have to explain everything."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So, and cellular automata have that feature and the laws of physics have that feature."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "But you also need to specify the initial condition."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And it also, it basically means that everything that happens is sort of a consequence of that initial condition."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And I think this kind of framework is just not the right one for biology."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And part of the way that it's easiest to see this is a lot of people talk about self reference being important in life."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "The fact that, you know, like

architecture of the cell includes the genome."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "So the genome has basically self referential information."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "So there's a lot of parallels there and people have talked about that at depth."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "But the other way of kind of thinking about it in terms of like a more physicsy way of talking about it is that what it looks like in biology is that the rules or the laws depend on the state."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "This is typical in computer science."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "This is obvious to you."}, {"time": 1878, "text":

biology, it seems to be that the state and the law change together as a function of time and we don't have that as a paradigm in physics."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And so a lot of people talk about this as being kind of a perplexing feature that maybe there are certain scenarios where the laws of physics or the laws that govern a particular system actually change as a function of the state of that system."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So yeah, the hope of physics, it's a hope, I guess, but often stated as a underlying assumption is that the law is static."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "And even having laws that vary in time and not even as a function of the state is very radical."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "When you..."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "The time in general, like you wanna remove time from the equation as much as possible."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "There's some interesting things in this like when we think sort of more deeply about the actual physics that we're trying to propose governs life with me with collaborators and then also other people that think about similar things that time might actually be fundamental and there really is an ordering to time."}, {"time": 1958,

Lee Cronin because I work with him very closely on these things, is that the laws of physics look the way they do because they're low memory laws."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So they don't require a lot of information to specify them."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "They're very easy for the universe to implement."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "But if you get something like me, for example, I require 4 billion year history to exist in the universe."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "I come with a lot of historical baggage."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "And that's part of what I am as a set of causes that exist

right?"}, {"time": 2111, "text": "And so people don't usually think about the fact that we're agents in the universe making that experiment, and therefore we put a little bit of life into that

in."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "It's an algorithmic procedure that you design the experiment."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "And so the origin of life problem becomes one of minimizing the information we

to try to recreate the historical origin of life on Earth or echoes of the historical origin?"}, {"time": 2251, "text": "I think echoes is more appropriate."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "I don't think

asking the question."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "And it's a little bit like, since you're in computer science, like if you know the answer to a problem, it's easier to find a program to specify the output, right?"}, {"time": 2276, "text": "But if you don't know the answer a priori, finding an algorithm for it, like say finding a prime or something, it's easy to verify it's a prime number."},

that the rules of how our universe is structured permit things like life to exist and what is the phenomena of life?"}, {"time": 2309, "text": "And those questions are obviously essentially the same question."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "And so you're looking essentially for this missing physics, this missing explanation for what we are, and you need to set up proper experiments that are gonna allow you to probe the vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way with as little information put in as possible to see when things, when does information actually emerge?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "How does it emerge?"}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And part of the sort of conjecture we have is that this physics only becomes relevant or at least this is my personal conjecture and it's sort of validated by this kind of theory experiment collaboration that we have working in this area that this, you know, sort of, I made the point about like gravity existing everywhere, right?"}, {"time":

matter."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "And so this idea that there's kind of a physics associated with information, for me, it's very evident that that physics doesn't become relevant until you need information to specify the existence of a particular object."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "And the scale of reality where that happens is in chemistry because of the combinatorial diversity of chemical objects that can exist far out, exceeds the amount of resources in our universe."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "So if you want it, you can't make every possible protein of length, you know, 200 amino acids, there's not enough resources."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "So in order for this particular protein to exist and this protein to exist in high abundance means that you have to have a system that has knowledge of the existence of that protein and can build it."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "So existence comes to be at the chemical level."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "So existence is most, is best

exists at every combinatorial scale, but it becomes more and more relevant the more set of possibilities that could exist because you have to specify more and more about why this thing exists and not the infinite."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "It's not an infinite set, but you know, the set of undefined set of other things that could exist."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "So can I ask a weird question,

physics, maybe chemistry for discovering the origin of life."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "No, but not the historical origin."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "Some kind of thing that we're talking about."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "What exactly would, what do you think that, like, what do you think that person, maybe you did to get that Nobel prize?"}, {"time": 2484, "text": "Like what would they have to have done?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Cause you can do a bunch of experiments that go like within the aha moment."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Like you rarely get the Nobel prize for like, you've solved everything, we're done."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "It's like some inkling of some deep truth."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "Like what do you think that would actually look like?"}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Would it be an experimental result?"}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental, maybe validation component."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "So what would that look like?"}, {"time": 2512, "text": "This is an excellent question."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "I want to, sorry, I'm going to make a quick point, which is just a slight tangent."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "But you know, like when people ask about the origin of mass, and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things, they never are like, we need to find the historical origins of life in the early unit."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Although those things are related, right?"}, {"time": 2528, "text": "So this problem of origins of life in the lab, I think is really important."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "But the Higgs is a good example because you had theory to guide it."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework that can say that we should be looking for these features and explain why they might be there and then be able to do the experiment and demonstrate that it matches with the theory."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "But it has to be something that is outside sort of the paradigm of what we might expect based on what we know, right?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "So this is a really sort of tall order."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And I think, I mean, I guess the way people would think about it is like, you know, if you had a bacteria that climbed out of your test tube or something, and it was like, you know, moving around on the surface, that would be ultimate validation."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "You saw the origin of life in an experiment, but I don't think that's quite what we're looking for."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I think what we're looking for is evidence of when information that originated within the bounds of your experiment and you can demonstrably prove emerged spontaneously in your experiment, wasn't put in by you, actually started to govern the future dynamics of that system and specify it."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "And you could somehow relate those two features directly."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "So you know that the program specifying what's happening in that system is actually internal to that system."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "Like say you have a chemical thing in a box."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "Well, so that's one Nobel Prize winning experiment, which is like information in some fundamental way originated within the constraints of the system without you injecting anything."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "But another experiment is you injected something."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And got out information."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So like you injected, I don't know, like some sugar and like something that doesn't necessarily feel like it should be information."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "Yeah, so I actually know, I mean, sugar is information, right?"}, {"time": 2647, "text": "So part of the argument here is that every physical object is, well, it's information, but it's a set of causal histories and also a set of possible futures."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So there is an experiment that I've talked a lot about with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lockman and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe about this idea that sometimes we talk about as like seeding assembly, which is you take a high complexity, like an object that exists in the universe because of a long causal history, and you seed it into a system of lower causal history."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "And then suddenly you see all of this complexity being generated."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "So I think another validation of the physics would be, say you engineer an organism by purposefully introducing something where you understand the relationship between the causal history of the organism and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients you're adding to it."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "And then you can predict the future evolution of that system to some statistical set of constraints and possibilities for what it will look like in the future."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "I'm a physical structure, obviously, like I'm composed of atoms, the configuration of them and the fact that they happen to be me is because I'm not actually my atoms, I am a informational pattern that keeps re patterning those atoms into Sarah."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "And I have also associated to me like a space of possible things that could exist that I can help mediate come into existence because of the information in my history."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "And so when you understand sort of that time is a real thing embedded in a physical object, then it becomes possible to talk about how histories when they interact and a history is not a unique thing, it's a set of possibilities."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "When they interact, how do they specify what's coming next?"}, {"time": 2763, "text": "And then where does the novelty come from in that structure?"}, {"time": 2765, "text": "Cause some of it is kind of things that haven't existed in the past can exist in the future."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "I talk to myself about myself in third person sometimes."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "It's been here all along."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Well, has it?"}, {"time": 2788, "text": "So, I mean that's."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "At least in this conversation, I think I've been conscious most of it, but maybe I haven't."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So speak for yourself."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "You're projecting your consciousness onto me."},

talked about causality and time being fundamental to the universe."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Where does consciousness fit into all of this?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value with the idea of panpsychism that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand is the physics of consciousness?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "Like one of the missing pieces in the physics view of the world is understanding the physics of consciousness."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it, but let's put consciousness as a label on a black box of mystery that we don't understand."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "Do you think that black box holds the key to finally answering the question of the physics of life?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "The problems are absolutely related."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "I think most, and I'm interested in both because I'm just interested in what we are."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "And to me, the most interesting feature of what we are is our minds and the way they interact with our minds."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "Like minds are the most beautiful thing that exists in the universe."},

human."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Or at least I think I am."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "But you think there's something special to this particular?"}, {"time": 2886, "text": "No, I'm not a human centric thinker."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "But are you one entity?"}, {"time": 2892, "text": "You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Like do you think of yourself as one entity or are you just a bunch of different components?"}, {"time": 2900, "text": "Like is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?"}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Or are you just a bunch of different things that are like a nice little temporary side effect?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information that just became temporarily aggregated into your individual, yeah."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "I agree with that view."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "I'll take that as a compliment actually."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "But nevertheless, that bundle of information has become conscious."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "Or at least keeps calling herself conscious."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "Yeah, I think I'm conscious right now, but I might not be, but that's okay."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "Or you wouldn't know."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So yeah, so this is the problem."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "So yeah, usually people when they're talking about consciousness are worried about the subjective experience."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "And so I think that's why you're saying, I don't know if you're conscious because I don't know if you're experiencing this conversation right now."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And nor do you know if I'm experiencing the conversation right now."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "And so this is why this is called the hard problem of consciousness because it seems impenetrable from the outside to know if something's having a conscious experience."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "And I really like the idea of also like the hard problem of matter, which is related to the hard problem of consciousness, which is you don't know the intrinsic properties of an electron not interacting, say for example, with anything else in the universe."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "All the properties of anything that exists in the universe are defined by its interaction because you have to interact with it in order to be able to observe it."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "So we can only actually know the things that are observable from the outside."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And so this is one of the reasons that consciousness is hard for science because you're asking questions about something that's subjective and supposed to be intrinsic to what that thing is as it exists and how it feels about existing."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And so I have thought a lot about this problem and its relationship to the problem of life."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "And the only thing I can come up with to try to make that problem scientifically tractable and also relate it to how I think about the physics of life is to ask the question, are there things that can only happen in the universe because there are physical systems that have subjective experience?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So does subjective experience have different causes that things that it can cause to occur that would happen in the absence of that?"}, {"time": 3038, "text": "I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that's a meaningful way of asking the question of consciousness."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I can't ask if you're having experience right now, but I can ask if you having experience right now changes something about you and the way you interact with the world."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "So does stuff happen?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "It's a good question to ask, does stuff happen if consciousness is?"}, {"time": 3061, "text": "Then it's a real physical thing, right?"}, {"time": 3063,

hours and all of a sudden just like this thought comes out and you get a little like inkling into the thought process."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Yeah, usually it's like when I'm running between things and not so much when I've had deep thoughts."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Well, yeah, so you."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "Deep thoughts are hard to articulate."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "One of

subjective aspect of consciousness."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "So people are very interested in what would be a correlate of consciousness."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "What's a correlate?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "A correlate is a feature that relates to conscious activity."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "So for example, a verbal report is a correlate of consciousness because I can tell you when I'm conscious."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "And then when I'm sleeping, for example, I can't tell you I'm conscious."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "So we have this assumption that you're not conscious when you're sleeping and you're conscious when you're awake."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "And so that's sort of like a very obvious example, but neuroscientists, which I'm no neuroscientist and I'm not an expert in this field."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "So, but they have very sophisticated ways of measuring activity in our brain and trying to relate that to verbal report and other proxies for whether someone is experiencing something."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And that's what is meant by neural correlates."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "And then, so when people are trying to think about studying consciousness or developing theories for consciousness, they often are trying to build an experimental bridge to these neural correlates, recognizing the fact that a neural correlate may or may not correspond to consciousness because that problem's hard and there's all these associated issues to it."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So that's, from a neuroscience perspective, it's like fake it till you make it."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "So you."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Pretty much, yeah."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "You fake whatever the correlates are and hopefully that's going to summon the thing that is consciousness."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "That sounds like, that's an awesome concept."}, {"time": 3279,

correlates of life?"}, {"time": 3320, "text": "You're saying they're similar kind of ways of thinking about it, but you mentioned about the communities."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "Yeah, so I think in astrobiology, it's not, there's no concept of chemical correlates of life."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "We don't think about it that way."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "We think if we find molecules that are involved in biology, we found life."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "So I think one of my motivations there was just to separate the fact that life has abstract properties associated to it."}, {"time":

of an interesting, you know, like what you're speaking about consciousness."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "What are you consciously aware of versus like what is your subconscious brain actually processing

everything."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "There's no incompatibility if you are willing to reject that assertion."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "So where's the randomness?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "Where's the magic that gives birth to the free will?"}, {"time": 3654, "text": "Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?"}, {"time": 3656, "text": "No, in my mind what free will is, is the fact that I as a physical system have causal control over certain things."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "I don't have causal control over everything, but I have a certain set of things."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And I'm also, as I described, sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories that exist in the universe and a particular set of futures that might exist."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And those futures

don't even know what people mean when they're talking about free will, honestly."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "It's like the whole discussion's really muddled."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "But in the sense that I am a causal agent, if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe, and there are certain things that happen because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will."}, {"time": 3705, "text":

choice come from?"}, {"time": 3720, "text": "I think that's related to the physics of consciousness."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "So one of the things I didn't say about that, I don't know, maybe this is me just being hopeful because maybe I just wanna have free will, but I don't think that we can rule out the possibility because I don't think that we understand enough about any of these problems."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "But I think one of the things that's interesting for me about the sort of inversion of the question of consciousness that I proposed is one of the features that we do is we have imagination, right?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "And people don't think about imagination as a physical thing, but it is a physical thing."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "It exists in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And so I'm like really intrigued by the fact that say, humans for, another physical system could do this too, it's not special to humans, but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets, and then we finally built them, right?"}, {"time": 3765, "text": "So they were represented in our minds and on the pages of things that we drew for hundreds of years before we could build those physical objects in the universe."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "But certainly the existence of rockets is in part causally, caused by the fact that we could imagine them."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "And so there seems to be this property that some things don't exist, they've never physically existed in the universe, but we can imagine the possibility of them existing and then cause them to exist, maybe individually or collectively."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And I think that property is related to what I would say about having choice or free will, because that set of possibilities, those set of things that you can imagine is not constrained to your local physical environment and history."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "It's trippy physics, but it exists, so there you go."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "I mean, in some sense, if you look at like general relativity and gravity morphing space time in that same way, maybe whatever the physics of consciousness might be, it might be morphing, that's like what free will is."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "It's morphing like the space, just like ideas make rockets come to life."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "It's somehow changing the space of possible realizations of like whatever's, yeah, okay, but that's."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it, like life is sort of changing the probability distributions over what can exist."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "That's the physics of what life is."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And then consciousness is this sort of layered property or imagination on top of it that kind of scrambles that a little bit more and like has access to, I don't know."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "It's kind of, we don't know how to describe it, right?"}, {"time": 3893, "text": "Like that's why it's interesting, but."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "But it's probabilistic."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So you do think like God plays dice."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "So let me."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "No, I think the description is probabilistic."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "I don't necessarily think the underlying physics is probabilistic."},

physics itself might still be deterministic."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "Maybe I'm, it's hard to know what concepts to hold on to."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "So I find myself constantly rejecting concepts, but then I have to grab another one and try to hold onto something from intellectual history."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "Well, it's possible that our mind is not able to hold the correct concepts in mind at all."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Maybe the word's deterministic or random or not the right even words, concepts to be holding."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything, this attempt in the current set of physical laws to try to unify them."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "Is there any hope that once a theory of everything is developed, and by theory of everything, I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory and general relativity, do you think that will contain some, like in order to do that unification, you would have to get something that would then give hints about the physics of life, physics of existence, physics of consciousness."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "Yeah, I used to not, but I actually, I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "And part of the reason is, I think I've talked a little bit already about these holes in physics, like the theories we have in physics, they have problems, they have lots of problems and they're very deep problems and we don't know how to patch them."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "And some of those problems become very evident when you try to patch quantum mechanics and general relativity together."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "So there is this kind of interesting feature that some of the ways of patching that might actually closely resemble the physics of life."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "And so the place where that actually comes up most, and actually we just had a workshop in the Beyond Center where I work at Arizona State University, and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks that the theory of quantum gravity when we solve it is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And I think that I agree with him on some levels because there's something very interesting where, if you look at these sort of causal set theories of gravity where they're looking for space as being emergent."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "And so space time is an emergent concept from a causal set, which is also sort of related, I think, to what Wolfram's doing with his physics project."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "It's the same kind of underlying math that we have in this theory that we've been developing related to life called assembly theory, which is basically trying to look at complex objects like molecules and bacteria and living things as basically being assembled from a set of component parts and that they actually encode all the possible histories that they could have in that physical object."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "So mathematically, all these ideas I think are related."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "I think a lot of people are thinking about this from different perspectives."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And then constructor theory that David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto have been developing is a totally different angle on it, but I think getting at some similar ideas."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "So it's a really interesting time right now, I think, for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating to maybe deeper principles about what life is."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "So short answer, yes."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "Long winded answer, rewind."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "Can we talk about aliens?"}, {"time": 4102, "text": "Anytime."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So one, I think one interesting way to sneak up on the question of what is life is to ask what should we look for in alien life?"}, {"time": 4117, "text": "If we were to look out into our galaxy and into the universe and come up with a framework of how to detect alien life, what should we be looking for?"}, {"time": 4129,

observationally measurable."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And this is one of the reasons that I started working with Lee on these ideas is because being a theorist, it's easy to work in a vacuum."},

is develop this method where they look at a molecule and they break it apart into all its component parts."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "And so you say you used to have some elementary building blocks and you can build up all the ways of putting those together to make the original object."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "And then you look for the shortest path in that space."}, {"time": 4195, "text":

elementary objects to an object given an elementary set of operations."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "And you can experimentally measure that with mass spec."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "And that's

shortest path is a bound on how hard it is for the universe to make that."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "Yeah, and I guess what you and Lee are saying that there's a heuristic, that's a good metric for like better perhaps than chemical correlates."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "Yes, because it doesn't, it's not contingent on looking for the chemistry of life on earth, on other planets."}, {"time": 4358,

like."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "It might not even be possible to interact with alien life because maybe something about, you know, our informational lineage, it makes it impossible for information

the physics."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "So I think the best ways we can ask questions are about life and chemistry and asking questions about if information is a real physical thing, what would its

it makes sense to apply it to molecules, but it's supposed to explain life, like the physics of life."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "So it should explain the things in this room in addition to molecules."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "So I guess the idea you could explore is just looking at everything on planet

are."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "And so is everything here, right?"}, {"time": 4758, "text": "So imagine that we built artificial systems that could actually see that feature of us, what else would

not be even able to communicate with it."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "Right, I think the internet has more hope than we do."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "Yeah, it's a hopeful place, yes."}, {"time": 4821,

we eat the same thing?"}, {"time": 4831, "text": "Could we potentially eat each other?"}, {"time": 4833, "text": "One person eats the other, or the aliens eat us."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "And the

genetic, but maybe information, right?"}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And I think part of your question is like, so if you think of life as like this history of events that happen in the universe, like there's this question of like, how divergent are those histories, right?"}, {"time": 4859, "text": "So when we get to the scale of technology, it's possible to imagine, although we can't even do it."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "Like imagine all the possible technologies that could exist in the universe."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "But if you think about all the possible chemistries, somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space and a lower set of possibilities."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "So it might be that like when we interact with aliens, we do have to go back to those more basal levels to figure out sort of what the map is, right?"}, {"time": 4882, "text": "Like the sort of where we have a common history."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "We must have a common history somewhere in the universe, but in order to be able to actually interact in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information in each other's food or eat each other as food is because we have a shared history."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "So we have to find that shared history."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "We have to find the common ancestor in this causality map, the causality tree."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "Yes, and we have a last universal common ancestor for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus of that causality map for life on earth."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "But the question is where would other aliens diverge on that map?"}, {"time": 4919, "text": "And I mean, so say there's a lot of aliens out there in the universe, each set of organisms will probably have like a number, you know, like Erdos number of like how far, like how far our common ancestor is."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth, the more likely we are to be able to have sexual reproduction."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "Well, it's like sort of like humans having common culture and languages, right?"}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Yeah, it might take a lot of work though with an alien cause you really have to get over a language barrier."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "So it's communication, it's resources."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "I mean, it's all the whole, and I think tied into that is the questions of like who's going to harm who."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "And actually definitions of harm."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "And whether your parents approve, you know, all those kind of questions."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "Whether the common ancestor approves."},

which I have always thought was deeply intriguing."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically as I don't have intuition for that because it's like one of those questions that you feel around for a while and you really just, you can't see it even though it might be right there."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "And in that sense, it's a little like the quantum to classical can transition."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "You're like really talking about two different kinds of physics."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "And I think that's kind of part of the problem."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "Once we understand the physics, that question might become more meaningful."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "But there's also this other issue, and this was really instilled on me by my mentor, Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc, because he always talks about how, you know, whether aliens are common or rare is kind of just, you know, it like, you know, it follows a wave of popularity and it just depends on like the mood of, you know, what the culture is at the time."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "And I always thought that was kind of an intriguing observation, but also there's this, you know, set of points about if you go by the observational evidence, which we're supposed to do as scientists, right?"}, {"time": 5043, "text": "You know, we have evidence of us and one origin of life event from which we emerged."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "And people wanna make arguments that because that event was rapid or because there's other planets that have properties similar to ours, that that event should be common."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "But you actually can't reason on that because our existence observing that event is contingent on that event happening, which means it could have been completely improbable or very common."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "And Brandon Carter, like clearly articulated that in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "So there is this kind of issue that we have to contend with dealing with life that's closer to home than we have to deal with with any other problems in physics, which we're talking about the physics of ourselves."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "And when you're asking about the origin of life event, that event happening in the universe, at least as like our existence is contingent on it."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments that way too."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "So, but the sort of otter part of it is like, when I think about how likely it is, I think it's because we don't understand this mechanism yet about how information can be generated spontaneously that I like, cause I can't see that physics clearly yet, even though I have a lot of, you know, like some things around the space of it in my mind, I can't articulate how likely that process is."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "So my honest answer is, I don't know."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "And sometimes that feels like a cop out, but I feel like that's a more honest answer and a more meaningful way of making progress than what a lot of people wanna do, which is say, oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance of having on an exoplanet with Earth like properties because there's lots of Earth like planets out there and life happened fast on Earth."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "Well, so I have kind of a follow up question, but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying about the way you're talking about human beings is you always say, and not to make yourself conscious about it, cause I really, really enjoy it."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "You say we, you don't say humans."}, {"time": 5157, "text": "You say, cause oftentimes like, you know, I don't know, evolutionary biologists will kind of put yourself out as an observer, but it's kind of fascinating to think that you as a human are struggling about your own origins."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "Yes, that's the problem."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "And yeah, and I think, I don't do that deliberately, but I do think that way."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And this is sort of the inversion from the logic of physics because physics as it's always been constructed has treated us as external observers of the universe."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "And we are not part of the universe."}, {"time": 5187, "text": "And this is why the problem of life, I think demands completely new thinking because we have to think about ourselves as minds that exist in the universe and are at this particular moment in history and looking out at the things around us and trying to understand what we are inside the system, not outside the system."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "We don't have

5223, "text": "I'm gonna, yeah, that's a really clean formulation of a very fundamental question, because you can only, to understand cellular automata, you have to be inside of it."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "But as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question, does it make you sad?"}, {"time": 5242, "text": "Does it make you hopeful whether we're alone or not?"}, {"time": 5247, "text": "Like in the different possible versions of that, if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe, does that give you?"}, {"time": 5257, "text": "At this moment in time, maybe."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "At this moment in the causal."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "Cause we may, I assume we have a future."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "Well, we definitely have a future."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "The question is where that future decreases the assembly."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "Like it could be where at the peak, or we could be just."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "But so I should give a caveat."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "I've given the caveat that I'm biased as a physicist, but I'm also biased as an eternal optimist."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "So pretty much all of my modes of operation for building theories about the world are not like an Occam's razor, what's the simplest explanation, but what's the most optimistic explanation."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "And part of the reason for that is if you really think explanations have causal power, in the sense that our, like the fact that we have theories about the world has enabled technologies and physically transform the world around us."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "I think I have to take seriously that as a part of the physics I wanna describe and try to build theories of reality that are optimistic about what's coming next because the theories are in part the causes of what comes next."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "So there could be a physics of hope or physics of optimism in there too."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "Is that seems like also, I mean, optimism does seem to be a kind of engine that results in innovation."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "So this is like, why the hell are we trying to come up with new stuff?"}, {"time": 5342, "text": "Oh, so I made this point about thinking life is the physics of existence."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "And it's not just the physics of existence, it's the physics of more things existing."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So I think one of these drives of like."}, {"time": 5352, "text":

to."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?"}, {"time": 5413, "text": "Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea that there might've been other original life events that happened on earth that were independent from the original life event that led to us and all of the life that we know on earth."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "And therefore there could be aliens in the sense they have a different origin event."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "Living among us."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And it was proposed by a number of people, but one of them was Paul

actually about the discovery of like viruses and bacteria, for a long time they were kind of a shadow biosphere."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "It was life that was around us, but invisible."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "But this takes it a little bit further and saying that all of those examples, viruses, bacteria and everything that we've discovered so far has this common ancestry and the last

tools of science?"}, {"time": 5495, "text": "Like this should be a serious effort."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "I think yes and no."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "And I mean, yes, because I think it's a serious hypothesis and I think it's worth exploring."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "And it is certainly more economical to look for signs of alien life on earth than it is to go and build spacecraft and send robots to other planets."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is, well, if we do find an example of another original life on earth, it's hugely informative

lot of regularities there and life does seem to have planetary scale organization that's consistent even with some of the patterns that we see at the individual scale."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomenon and the chemistry of life has to be sort of not just, it's not, an individual is not necessarily the fundamental unit of life, right?"}, {"time": 5580, "text": "The fundamental unit of life is these informational lineages and they're kind of, they intersect over spatial scales."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "So everything on earth is kind of related by the common causal history."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So it's hard for me based on the way I think about the physics and also some of the stuff that my group has done to really think that there could be evidence or there could be a second sample of life on earth."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "But I think there are ways that we need to be more concrete about that."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "And I have thought a little bit about like, like you can represent the chemistry in an individual cell as a network."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "And then those networks, something my group has shown actually scale with the same property."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "So ecosystems have the same properties as individuals as planetary scale."}, {"time": 5626, "text": "And then you could imagine if you had alien chemistry intermixed in there, that scaling would be broken."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "So if there's some robustness property or something associated to it, and you get alien chemistry in there, it just breaks everything."}, {"time": 5637, "text": "And you don't have a planetary ecosystem functioning and individuals functioning across all these scales."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "So I guess what I'm arguing is life is not a scale dependent phenomenon."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "It's not just cellular life."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "So if you have a shadow biosphere, it has to be

right?"}, {"time": 5661, "text": "And I think it would tell us a lot."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "So there has been very minimal effort of people to look for a shadow biosphere."}, {"time": 5668,

life inside volcanoes, right?"}, {"time": 5698, "text": "It seems like sufficiently chemically different like to be living in the darkness where there's a lot of heat and maybe you could have different Earths on a planet."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "Or like if you go deep enough in the crust, maybe there's like a layer where there's no life."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "And then there's

little flippant, but really like there could be like chemical cycles deep in the Earth's crust that might be alive and are completely distinct in chemical origin to surface life."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "Right, that they wouldn't be interacting with each other."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "Yeah, and that's one of the proposals for the shadow biosphere is like, sometimes people talk about it as being geologically or geographically distinct that it might be, you know, you have no life for this region and then a different example."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "And then sometimes people talk about it being chemically distinct, that the chemistry is sufficiently different, that it's completely orthogonal or non interacting with our chemistry."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "It seems to me at least the chemistry is a more powerful boundary than geographic."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "What do you think about all

5781, "text": "Yeah, so I've actually been more intrigued by the cultural phenomena UFOs than the phenomena UFOs themselves, because I think it's intriguing about how we are preparing ourselves

for us."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "That's my motivation."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "And having some, you know, streaks across the sky or something and saying that's aliens, it doesn't tell you anything."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "So unless you have a deeper explanation and you have, you know, more lines of, you know, where is this gonna take us in the future?"}, {"time": 5822, "text": "It's

psychologically and sociologically prepare ourselves to sort of like, what would that look like?"}, {"time": 5837, "text": "And very importantly, which is what a lot of people talk about politically,

5875, "text": "I think that's a really, you know, in one sense it's a conspiratorial question, but I think in another, it's an inspiration to change the way we do government to where secrets don't,

opened up."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "And different languages open up different possibilities."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin to truly to help you understand, maybe fall in love with the words."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the language."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "It's understanding something much deeper, the music of the language or something, music of the ideas."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "It's very hard to say exactly what that is."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce read some sentences, they have a different cadence, they have a different tonality, they have different music to use your word."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And all of a sudden you think about them differently and the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you when they're read in certain ways."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "That's what great actors can do."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "But I think language is rich like that."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language when we think about its logical form, when we think about the sort of claims of philosophical logic that you can make or how do you translate this proposition into some symbolic form, I think that's part of what goes on in language."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can when great poets or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect, it's way more than that."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian, but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators."}, {"time": 2902,

speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian, but dance back and forth and try to share with people who don't speak one of the languages, the music that they're missing and sort of almost hear that music as if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through the wall."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "I get a sense of it."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas in a way that can be conveyed to people who don't speak that

that does happen."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "So we read Dostoevsky in translation."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room, which is super helpful, but I also encourage my students to, some of them will have different translations than others."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And that can be really helpful for the non native speaker because by paying attention to the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English, they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "And then you can start to ask about what those differences are."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And I think there's a kind of magic to it."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be for people who grew up in them, especially who speak them as native speakers."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of is, for example, for Dostoevsky, most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "And there's a lot of discussion about who did it better and so on."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying and use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "I heard the individual translators in interviews and in blog posts and articles discuss particular phrases that they differ on, but like to do that for an entire book, that's a fascinating exploration as an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations."},

interesting idea."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And you can do that for other projects and other languages too."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, one of the, I don't know, I have this weird, huge range

3115, "text": "I wanted to know what was interesting about him."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period made, was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this, he translated Christianity into the vernacular."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "He started giving sermons in German to the peasants, sermons used to be in Latin and nobody could speak Latin."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?"}, {"time": 3142, "text": "So he translated it into German, but in doing it, the resources of the German language are different from the resources of the Latin language."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Then there's a word in middle high German, Grund, which we translated as ground."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "And it's got this earthy feel to it."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out of and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty to it."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And there's no Latin word for that."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "But in

think that form of existence was that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done in Latin."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "So we talked about Dostoevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as a way to explore human nature."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So he is

Camus totally fascinating."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to, The Myth of Sisyphus, which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible, really fascinating."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "He's a great writer, really engaging."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "The opening line is something like, there is but

be good."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I was happy about that, but he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "And absurd is a kind of technical term for him."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole

kind of a happy ending."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "But I also thought it's a dim view of what our existence amounts to."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "So I think there's something fascinating about that."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "But what I came to believe, and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the thing about aliveness that I published once, that's secretly a criticism of

of mechanism for aliveness."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today, I ask that question

said, my high school kids is like, hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world, who's bringing someone in and saying, well, how do I do this?"}, {"time": 593, "text": "And so the level of inquisitiveness he has is really impressive."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did because he's figuring out all these little situations."}, {"time": 604,

this is my style."}, {"time": 612, "text": "This is what I do."}, {"time": 614, "text": "I'm gonna lift and work out hard and I'm not gonna add anything to my game."}, {"time": 619, "text": "Whereas you've seen many progressions in Jordan Burrows game."}, {"time": 622, "text": "He just made his 10th world team."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And if you have a really keen eye, you've been able to watch him change."}, {"time": 630, "text": "I've been watching him since 2007."}, {"time": 632, "text": "He's changed so much."}, {"time": 634, "text": "And obviously still maintained a world class level almost the entire time."}, {"time": 638, "text": "When you say change, like what changed?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "Because he's got that double leg."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Yeah, but there's no double leg anymore."}, {"time": 645, "text": "He like his double leg for the first time against Alex Deering, he hadn't hit it in years."}, {"time": 648, "text": "Yeah, so that's like when people think about Jordan Burrows, they think about the double leg because in his early years, fire, he had a great double leg, right?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "And even so in those years, I would say the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg wasn't his level of explosiveness, it was his level of persistence."}, {"time": 665, "text": "He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles and on the screen, all of a sudden he's on you."}, {"time": 673, "text": "And he was just super persistent with it."}, {"time": 675, "text": "And I think that was probably the key."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And then you saw, when he came out to the won the first world championship in 2011, it was kind of that type of mentality."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And then shortly after then, obviously everyone was starting to lower their stance getting lower and he developed a really good like Mantis go behind series where he would go one way the other way."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Then he started developing really good like low single ankle pick type thing, you know?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "And then his hand fighting got really tremendous, like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And now I just commented at the 21 trials, like a few of the defensive sequences he got into, it was like, holy shit, like just not from an athletic standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the things he were doing was just tremendous."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So I've seen him as someone like who's continued to reinvent themselves over the course of the last 10, 12 years."}, {"time": 720, "text": "Especially as a junior and senior in college, you're exceptionally dominant."}, {"time": 726, "text": "If you were to face him at the peak, both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling, could you beat him?"}, {"time": 733, "text": "And if you can beat him, well, of course you can beat him."}, {"time": 738, "text": "How do you solve the Jordan Boroughs problem?"}, {"time": 740, "text": "Well, so from a folk style wrestling standpoint, Folk style, yes."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Folk style."}, {"time": 744, "text": "So, you know, he had some competitive matches his junior and senior year."}, {"time": 748, "text": "He had a two, one win over, or maybe it's three, two over Michael Chandler, who was my teammate who's fighting in the UFC now."}, {"time": 753, "text": "He had a two and win over Tyler Caldwell."}, {"time": 756, "text": "So I think you can glean some insight into that."}, {"time": 759, "text": "You know, he got ridden, he got so mad about this up on a podcast."}, {"time": 762, "text": "So during Corona, we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And we were doing like the last 10 years best 165s."}, {"time": 769, "text": "And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute."}, {"time": 772, "text": "He got so mad he wanted to come on the podcast the next day."}, {"time": 774, "text": "So hopefully he doesn't listen to this and be like, fuck you, man, you know?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "But, you know."}, {"time": 779, "text": "This is during Corona."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Corona, last year."}, {"time": 781, "text": "He got mad."}, {"time": 782, "text": "We were talking about, we were."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Before the trials."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Yeah, correct, yeah."}, {"time": 785, "text": "So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus and that was his junior year, not his senior year."}, {"time": 791, "text": "Sure, right?"}, {"time": 791, "text": "But it's close."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So I think there's some things there."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I think the interesting thing would be if I would have stuck around, right?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "So I chose to go into mixed martial arts after 2008, I would have been 74 and he would have been 74."}, {"time": 803, "text": "So we would have had to wrestle."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle is a lot more difficult to solve than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And I think, I don't think he would, I think he would acknowledge that he's much better at freestyle than he was at folk style."}, {"time": 817, "text": "You know, although he was very good, he's better."}, {"time": 819, "text": "This is like raw speed explosiveness."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Present a problem to you."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really excel on the mat in kind of either style."}, {"time": 829, "text": "In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions, but in folk style, like his whole, like in his entire college career, I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing, you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position."}, {"time": 843, "text": "He was good enough on most people to get off bottom without it being an issue, but it wasn't like, oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have to be careful, there's a lot of things here."}, {"time": 851, "text": "You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there."}, {"time": 853, "text": "Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't wanna say never, but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare, very, very rare, and he does have like lace transitions, so he gets a lot of points there."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So, and obviously freestyle is, it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Where we're only doing takedowns, so yeah."}, {"time": 872, "text": "Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials, to Kyle Dake?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "Oh, Kyle's so, so, he's so good, right?"}, {"time": 881, "text": "I mean, I think, I think his performance at the Olympics was, his loss then was shocking to, I mean, we understand it happened to Kyle Dake, you know?"}, {"time": 890, "text": "He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever, and obviously he was on the losing side for a while, and now he's on the winning side."}, {"time": 898, "text": "But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip, and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like it's not a coin flip."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake isn't gonna win that match significantly more times than he isn't, is what it feels like."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Yeah, I forgot which trials it was."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?"}, {"time": 919, "text": "Like he, he, you saw inklings of like, oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw, but then he lost one of the matches decisively, and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms, so actually in 16, at the trials we had, so Jake Herbert was number one seed, he was a former, as Guy Russell, I was a former world silver medalist."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet, who is now a world champion, Olympic champion."}, {"time": 954, "text": "You had Kyle Dake in the bracket, who was a two time world champion now, and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket, who had not made any teams yet, but is now, what, a four time world medalist, two time world champion."}, {"time": 964, "text": "So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that, won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal."}, {"time": 970, "text": "So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16, and Kyle's contention the whole time, and they argued about this, so I actually did a little bit of backstabbing."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Well, it's not backstabbing."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And both of them, or just one of them?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "I didn't tell any of them."}, {"time": 984, "text":

sorry, we're talking."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Over Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "In a Folkestown match."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The hypothetical."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "Back in

1024, "text": "So completely hypothetical."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me for picking Kyle Dake."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "He wants to come on the next day and argue his point."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So I said, F that, that's dumb."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Oh, we had to pick a winner."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "We had to do something hypothetical."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So then I called Kyle Dake, and I said, Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case in the morning."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "If he's gonna do that, why don't you come in and argue your case?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So they both show up, and they went at it."}, {"time":

1072, "text": "Okay, probably three matches."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan in the best two out of three, right?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage because I have to compete on Saturday and then competing on, which it's a fair argument."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "But I also see USA Wrestling's point."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "It's like, if someone wins a world medal, we are gonna reward them because we want that person on the team again."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "It's crazy though that

don't know how wrestlers do it."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Because you have to go to war like three matches and then face Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Yeah, especially a few of those years with Dakehead, the name Andrew Howe."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But it was a really competitive matches."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "David Taylor had really competitive matches with him."},

dependent, especially in neutral positions, heavily dependent on timing and other things."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "I was wrestling very, very minimally because I started fighting again."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So like my athletic shape was great, but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So I think they were actually trying to do Burrows, Dake at the Beat

wrestle Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "It fell out."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Would you wrestle him?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I said, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "And it's like, well, they said, I trained with them for four days the year before."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "It wasn't going to go so well for me, but it's like, okay, you're missing a main event."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life, I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I can help you guys raise a bunch of money for Beat the Streets."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "My goal is I think I thought I could get one take down or turn on him

together."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "I think he'll probably get mad because I think in the live go, we did like the 12 or 15 minutes."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "I think I actually scored a take down in that, I believe."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Maybe, or maybe it was a turn."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "Yeah, so I knew what was going to happen."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "I knew what the outcome was going to be."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "I knew I could probably, I was hoping I could stay competitive and maybe, you know, lose like 10, two or something."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Well, let's walk back."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Cause I think I originally brought it up in terms of how prepared were you against Jake Paul versus Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Yeah, I worked hard."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "But it was, I told you, I started training for my, I mean, once I had my hip surgery, they said, you know, for the first six weeks, you can't even walk."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And it was hard for me to listen to them cause by week four and a half, five, I was feeling pretty good."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "I want to get rid of my crutches."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "But I'm like, you know what?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "This is for the rest of my life."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And if you get the, so if you get the real hip replacement, there's no wrestling, there's no nothing, right?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So that's the next step."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "I'm going to take this serious."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "So I do my crutches for six weeks."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Can't necessarily do anything, you know?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So then I get done with the three months, which is like January and I'm like, okay, I should start working out."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay, I'm now I'm fat."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "I'm fucking fat."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "I'm going to get in better shape cause I haven't been able to do anything."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So I'm actually start working out."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And, and then that happened, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And, you know, I knew I wasn't going to be a full time boxer."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So it's like, how do I put a boxing camp together?"}, {"time": 1331, "text": "So I found, you know, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes."},

"text": "He came over three weeks."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "I went to Freddie Roach for a week."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "So I kind of like, you know, try to get as many good as ideas as I could."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And my thought was like, okay, well if this dude sucks, I can just be tough and, you know, block a few punches, get him tired and then beat him up."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "If he's good, that's probably not much of my do about in the next three months."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "Cause I'm, I was never good at boxing in the first place."}, {"time": 1364, "text":

striking was predicated on."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "It wasn't about, hey, I'm gonna do damage on the feet in order to make something else happen."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "It was like, how do I clear this barrier, get a hold of you."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "And if you, I actually did the math one time."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I think I got a takedown."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "If you include the knockout round against Masvidal, I got a takedown in every round except two."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA, I got a takedown."},

"Once you get your hands on them, you get the takedown."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "But the incredible thing about you, I just recently talked, spent a couple of days with Jimmy Pedro."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "And he talked about his guys and just champions in general hating to lose more than they love winning."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And the way you talked about losing, you lost very few times in your career, like later you were dominating both wrestling and MMA."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "But the way you took these losses against people that are, I don't know, below elite level."},

that's not what I meant."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I was in trouble."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "It's okay, no, it's good."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "No, no, no, but like what, can you explain the psychology behind that?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Like what, is there a system behind this?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Is there a philosophy behind this?"}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Well, I wasn't very good in the beginning."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I think that's where it all starts from."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I started at five."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "I probably started competing more at age 10, 11."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Didn't really get good until 13."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "It's still at 13."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "I'm starting to get great."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "I'm getting better, right?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I'm pretty good."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "So I actually have, I have written this book on sports psych, but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Cause I've had this philosophy for years that there has to be this balance between two things, right?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "So on the one hand, in this category, on the one hand you have hating to lose."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "But on this other hand, you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Cause if you don't have that, you're never gonna reach your full potential either."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "And so you have to balance these two balls at the same time, right?"}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And so like for me, I always, and this is maybe cause I wasn't good, but I was always like, let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Let me go find, I would like literally, like seventh, eighth grade when I was starting to get better, it was like, and there's no internet."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Well, there's no one was using the internet."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "It was like a wrestling magazine."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And like, hey dad, there's a tournament here."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I think that, are the kids gonna be there?"}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?"}, {"time": 1537, "text": "You would wrestle like in competition against them."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "In competition."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Yeah, yeah, in competition."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Hey, I heard there's this tournament."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Here's the magazine, this is this tournament."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "You weren't trying to win."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "You were trying to get the experience."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "I was trying to wrestle the best guys."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "Maybe I win, maybe I lose."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "There's no, when you do a competition, there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "You're just doing competition, right?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So like eighth grade year, I won way way, I probably lost a handful of times in the state of Wisconsin."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "It was probably really, really minimal the amount of times I lost, you know?"}, {"time": 1573, "text": "But it was just about getting the challenge."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And it's like, some kids, and not kids in my club, because I'll push them very hard on this, are scared of challenging themselves."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "They like being the big fish in the small pond."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "They're not willing to go say, I want to go get that guy, and I want to get that guy, and I want to get that guy."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me is like, I always just loved to challenge."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?"}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And I understood from a young age, because it wasn't a good, losing is a part of it."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "You're not always going to win."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And that was kind of it."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "It's like, hey, sometimes, you know, and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way, but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And like, that's pretty rare."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "I didn't plan for that to happen."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "That was just what happened, you know?"}, {"time": 1615, "text": "Okay, but you also didn't lose like the second part of your college career."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I don't like losing, I still don't like it."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But you seem to, okay, but you don't, you don't seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off a little bit."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "Okay, so like with, specifically with these two instances that you bring up."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "All right, let's."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "Let's go, let's go deep, let's go deep."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "So the Masvidal one, it feels different, because I had."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Let's, for people who don't know."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Masvidal loss was your first loss."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "First loss."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "In MMA."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "I mean, it was a dramatic loss."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Very dramatic."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially one of the greats of all time coming into this fight."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And so, this pressure, all of that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "I didn't feel the pressure."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "So the Masvidal fight is, he got one fucking move on me."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "It's not like he beat me."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And if we do that again, I think I win."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "At that point in my life, for sure, I think I win way, way, way more times than I lose."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "He knew that too."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "That's why he didn't want to sound the bout agreement."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad, because I had to continue to taunt him in order to get him to sign, right?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So that one hurt because, as people don't know, my MMA career, I'll just go through it fast."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "I did three fights in like smaller leagues."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I got signed by Bellator."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I was undefeated for three and a half years."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "I was nine and oh."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "When I got done with that in 2012, 2013, I, at that point in my head, I was just going to transition to the UFC because that's where you go."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "I was ranked like sixth in the world."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "I hadn't really had a competitive match at the end of the Bellator thing."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me, we still haven't had this conversation."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime, chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "He just said, I went to his office and he literally said, we're not interested."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "We're not going to make you an offer."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Did you, did you mention something too about him, about the UFC?"}, {"time": 1749, "text": "That was a year before that."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "That was a year before."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And that might play a role in it, I think."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "So yes, what happened the year before that was I called him a liar, which, but listen, I'm writing this one because he said you can't test for drugs because I'm all natural, which you can tell by my physique."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "And I was always put off by the fact that so many people cheated."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And I was very vocal about that."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And so he had made some statement like, oh, well, there's no way you could test."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "I said, bullshit."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "You, very specifically, I said USADA does it for all other sports worldwide, you can do it."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And then it was funny because I hired USADA a couple of years later."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "So I think he took some offense to that, but that was like a year and almost a year and a half, I think, somewhere, years later."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "It's not like he holds a grudge or anything."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "You can read about it other places."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So I got released from a belt."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "It's not like this is a negotiation."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "I got released from my belt or contract."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "I said, I'm out of here."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "I'm going to go to the UFC."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "I go to Vegas, and then I was told, hey, there's no offer for you."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Tough shit, you know?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So then I ended up signing with one championship."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "I spent, what, three and a half years there."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "I won the belt in my second fight and retained the title the entire time."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And then I just, I think."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "Again, dominating people."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight."}, {"time": 1829,

saying, okay, if you fight, if you beat George, you're gonna get the title shot against Marty."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And it's like, this is what I've been working for the entire, I've been trying to prove I was the best fighter in the world for the last 10 years, and I've not been afforded this opportunity."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So when I lost to George, that was hard, because it was something that I had waited for for a really, really long time."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "It was something that I thought I could compete for, but I never got the opportunity to do, so that one was hard."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "At the same time, from just the competitive logistically, it's like, he got me with one move."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes, and I got beat a bunch of different ways."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So that was like, fuck, if I get it again, I could have done it, but they're not gonna let me have it again."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year or the next week or whatever."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "You lose at Big Ten, you go to nationals two weeks later."}, {"time": 1905,

definitely would have been a lot of time spent getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?"}, {"time": 1921, "text": "Which I already spent time there, and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip, the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do, was preventing me from doing some things, and it's why, if you look at the fight, I'm bent over as I go for the double leg."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So what happened for people who don't know, you went in for a double leg, and he went."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "Flying knee."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "He did a flying knee, and it caught you well."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "Specifically the way he did that knee was kind of different than the way anyone had thrown flying knees before."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical, whereas he took a few like running steps and went more, you know, the trajectory of the angle was different."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So I think that's kind of probably why it caught, you know, I think a lot of things in combat, well, probably everything, but I focus specifically on combat, happen subconsciously."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Like our brain is reading what's coming at us, and lots of times it's stuff we've seen before so we can judge how to move correctly."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And you misread because it's something you haven't seen before."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "So that loss was really hard."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "With the Burroughs one, I told you, I knew I was gonna lose."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So it was like, whatever, you know?"}, {"time": 1985, "text": "I'm taking this because I want to put the sport of wrestling out there in a big way."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "I wanna help them raise a lot of money."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "We sold at Madison Square Garden, Hulu Theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money."}, {"time":

"Absolutely, but like I told everyone, whether I win or lose on Saturday night, I'm gonna be back coaching wrestling on Monday, because that's what I enjoy doing, and I was back coaching wrestling on Monday."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "And once I'm out, these middle school kids give me a little bit of shit about it."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "But where were you in terms of your shape and how you felt in the Mazodal fight?"}, {"time": 2024, "text": "Would you say you're on the, I mean, it's a difficult question to ask of a world class athlete, but like, were you past peak?"}, {"time": 2034,

supplements, I don't know."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "But for me, that was evident."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "But you get this, so you get this crosshair where if you're smart, like I mentioned John Burrows was, you're still gaining wisdom, you're gaining strategy, you're gaining a lot of things, right?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "And so while your physicality may go down, your overall skill level still may be rising, especially in MMA because people usually start later because they're gaining wisdom, strategy, all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?"}, {"time": 2072, "text": "They're getting all these things."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So their actual competitive peak, despite their athletic peak going down, might still be a few years past that, right?"}, {"time": 2079,

because I knew I had a lot of pain here, and I knew it was because of this."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done, I'll just get it taken care of, whatever."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "But every time I train, I have pain kind of like all up my back, and the day after the surgery, I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my, the surgery was on the left side."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "There was no pain on the right side of my back."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "I'm like, that's fucking weird."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "Like every morning I wake up, there's a lot of pain there, you know?"}, {"time": 2112, "text": "I'm like, okay, well I'm on pain pills."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "Maybe it'll come back tomorrow."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And that's because I'd never been back since my hip surgery."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "So it was weird, because it was like this, I thought this was affecting this, but it was affecting all the way across my whole back."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "So if I get to get a new hip, honestly, if I, I don't know if this is gonna change the competitive outcome whatsoever."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "If I

time there."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "So I was around, Tyron was a champion, Anthony was a champion at lightweight."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "I was, you know, same gym as him, and we had a lot of

was still the champion when I came into the UFC and we said, no, we're not gonna fight."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Hey, so he can't change history, right?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So once something

Keegan O'Toole."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "He just won a junior world title this year."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And so when I'm doing private lessons, I have such think about the development of the athletes."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time it's like, I'm just gonna help them with whatever they need help with."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "And it's still

to be able to just shake hands sometimes and say like, I'm gonna try to kick your ass."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Should you try to kick my ass?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "You know, like just to go, like."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Yeah, it's a good feeling."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "It's so much fun."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And I don't get to do that very much."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And the answer is yeah."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "The problem, unfortunately for me, and maybe you could talk me off a

blow up and it's just like, I just want to wrestle just to wrestle."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "I'd rather just like go in a room where no one can watch and just wrestle."}, {"time": 2341, "text":

joking around a little bit, even when you're going super hard."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "So I feel like, especially in the modern day with the internet, that's a compelling way to do."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "So I've thought about, this is the one thing I've thought about doing."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Cause I told you about my buddy was the content thing."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "It's called Rockfin."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "Thought about doing, you know, the old really famous Gracie challenge."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Okay, so I've thought about doing the aspirin challenge."},

I pin you."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "No points, no nothing."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "We just wrestle."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Camera, that's it, right?"}, {"time": 2420, "text": "It's camera in the room."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Maybe there's a referee cause we don't want there to be contention over the pin."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "Just one pin."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?"}, {"time": 2428, "text": "If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars."}, {"time": 2433,

you?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "Cause the jackpot."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Well, cause obviously I would put the content somewhere where people would watch it, right?"}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Oh, so you're gonna make money."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "Yeah, so you'd make money that way."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "But it's not exponentially growing, right?"}, {"time": 2462, "text": "It's just going up by like."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people that could pin me."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "So I would either just not choose those people or wait till I get a really large audience and people get really excited and in that case, I'm making a lot of money."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "What do you think, how many matches would go with you, like Khaldech shows up?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "I don't think he could pin me."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "I mean like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me, but he can't pin me."}, {"time": 2485,

last two years."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So you think you can be done on points and just pin them?"}, {"time": 2501, "text": "This is actually one of the issues I have with Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of, people get so mad at me."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Sorry, Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?"}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass and the score is 16 to two, but he can't pin me."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "I'm probably going to pin him."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So I'm better than Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Nah, that ain't right."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "He just whooped my ass."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Like if we can go the whole, cause they do submission only."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for, what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?"}, {"time": 2536, "text": "What's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "Something like that, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "He's gonna outscore me significantly."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "He will not pin me, I promise you that."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "So now we go to the overtime."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Strong words, but yeah."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "He won't, Jordan Burrows is not gonna, he's gonna beat me."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I will give you that."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Kyle Dake won't pin you either."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Now David Taylor, he might pin me cause he's a very good pinner also."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "They'll beat me very badly, they will not pin me."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like, right, so in Eddie Bravo you get a rear naked choke or an armbar."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Okay, give me a cradle, I'll probably pin him."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Okay, a good cradle."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "You can say cradle or maybe give them, then they're probably not gonna pin me, right?"}, {"time": 2578, "text": "Maybe, maybe there's a chance, but probably not."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Cause that's just not their specialty."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So for people who don't know, the Eddie Bravo thing is when it goes into overtime, you get a dominance position on a person and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "This is the wrestling equivalent."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "But you take their back or mount."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "Maybe an armbar, yeah, like a wrestling armbar."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So, and I don't think that's very fair."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Cause if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your ass."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And then, you know, and so I think the reason why Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that I don't think, I think they know this, but would admit it."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "I don't think their point scoring system adequately rewards what people value."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So like in wrestling, we value takedowns cause it gets us closer to the pin."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "And the most valuable scoring is a near fall, near to the pin, because that's the ultimate goal to sport."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Whereas in Jiu Jitsu, for example, like if I were to get a takedown, so like if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn't pull guard I would probably get the takedown."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "Now, if somehow he didn't submit me, which he probably would, right?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "But say he got, got close to like 12 submissions, but somehow I slipped out of all of them."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "Now I went to zero, like that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "Like he should very clearly win cause he almost submitted, you know what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "Like there, and I, and I realized the difficulty."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions, but that is the most valuable thing is getting close to finishing the match."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "But okay, so this, this isn't about the sport."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "This is about the Ben Askren challenge that we're talking about."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "What, why 30 minutes?"}, {"time": 2668, "text": "Why not unlimited time?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Why, why go until whenever?"}, {"time": 2673, "text": "Cause then it's just a cardio thing."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Cause at some point then someone would just have to fall over dead, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "There's no more skill level involved."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "It's just who can stand up the longest."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "You honestly don't think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "How do you think that's actually going to look?"}, {"time": 2689, "text": "How are they going against you for 30 minutes?"}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So it's going to be kind of boring for the most part."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "What position are you going to be stuck in?"}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Because you, well, you can't, but you can't, you just can't have a gigantic amount of action for 30 minutes."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So I relate to this because some of my kids, when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like, well, but I can't do that for seven minutes."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "And I'm like, well, you know, like say, say if I had you do hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight, as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "You're going to, your pace will slow down, right?"}, {"time": 2720, "text": "So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step here because in wrestling, you're competing against someone."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "So if you're here at a hundred and you go to 80, but they go to 70, that's great."},

if we get tired, that's fine."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "If they get more tired, that's better."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "So I think most people would know that."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "So they would kind of slow it down."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "But yeah, I think at 30, I mean, I've wrestled 30 minute goes, I've wrestled hour long goes."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "You're not going to get so tired, you're going to fall over in that time period."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "But at some point, if it's unlimited, someone will get so tired or dehydrated that they're just going to freaking fall over."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?"}, {"time": 2766, "text": "You think the other person is always going to be going for the pin and thereby make it dynamic."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Well, if they're working that hard, then they might exhaust themselves, right?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "And obviously then if you're being that dynamic, then you're adding risk to yourself too, because you are doing that."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Well, I love this."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "This is a great idea."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "Well, I figured I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums, or not as great people in the beginning."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "And then I would start bringing in better people because they would be enticed by $20,000, the possibility to win."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "And not much fanfare, just a camera and just local."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "That's it, in my wrestling room."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "And so then maybe you have like, you know, for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds of the most fun things that happen."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes if you want to."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "I mean, I think most people, if they're not really, really elite, I'm probably going to pin them."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "If they're not really elite."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "That's something I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "This has been like fun for me to think about."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "And obviously it plays in my skill sets because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So, like you said, you weren't very good in your early days until 13, 14."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "What was the switch?"}, {"time": 2844, "text": "You started to dominate people in your college career."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "You dominated."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And obviously you stopped losing at some point."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "So, well, I would say, so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition, I would go in the summers and try to make the world team."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "So, I would lose some, not a lot, right?"}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Minimally."}, {"time": 2865,

you, but in America at my age, you usually play like a sport every season, right?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So, that's what I did in the beginning."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "I had minimal success in wrestling."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "I was kind of chunky."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And then in fifth grade, I don't know."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And I can't tell you, I wanted to be better."},

emotional maturity is kind of one of the key indicators of how longterm successful someone's gonna be."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And at age 11, I said, I don't wanna play baseball."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball because I wanna wrestle more because I wanna get better at wrestling."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So, at age 11, I quit baseball so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Because that was all that existed at that point in time."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "You couldn't wrestle in June, July, or any of those other months."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "What was that desire to get better?"}, {"time": 2919, "text": "So, it's not about winning."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I don't know where it came from."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I just wanted to get better."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "I wanna get better."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "I wanna be good at this."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "I wanna be really good at this."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "So, when you're looking at kids now as a coach, you're looking for that."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And I wanna try to also inspire that."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "I mean, honestly, I think as a coach, that's probably my biggest job is to get a kid and get them to believe I can do this."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "Because if I can do this, well, I can do that."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I can do that too, right?"}, {"time": 2948, "text": "And there's so many kids who, unfortunately, have shitty parents or bad teachers that tell them, you suck, you can't be anything, right?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So, I think my biggest goal as a coach is to get someone to believe they can do it."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it, they're the most fun, but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?"}, {"time": 2965, "text": "The ones who think they can are the ones that need me the most."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Because they need someone to, let's go."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "So, I don't know what inspired me."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "At age 11, fifth grade, I quit."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "So, then I started having more success where I'm like, say, placing at the state tournament."},

success."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Seventh grade was the first year I won the youth state tournament."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "So, I'm getting better."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good, but when I went to the national tournaments, I was still having really minimal success."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "My freshman year, I decided to quit football."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Same reason."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "It's like, well, I need to put more time into this."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "My parents, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "So, we have a year round club, and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity to go to a club year round."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "So, we had a mat in my basement."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "I had to go find, hey, you wanna come wrestle?"}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Yeah, to find partners for myself."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "What'd you do?"}, {"time": 3023, "text": "Did you drill?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Did you live wrestle?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "What'd you do in that basement?"}, {"time": 3026, "text": "So, actually, I think, you'll enjoy this."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "I think the start of my scrambling was kind of based around that."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So, I got kind of, I think it's probably my freshman sophomore."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year, I found two kids who were really consistent who would come out, like you would come out on, he would come out on Tuesday, and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?"}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And they would come every week, and they were really consistent partners for me to have in the summer."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "But they weren't nearly as good as me."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "They were way worse."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "So, it's like, okay, how do I, how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling for them to come back?"}, {"time": 3065, "text": "Because if I just whoop their ass, they're not gonna come back, you know?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could, and I thought they could do a takedown before not getting it, and then try to like escape or get out."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So, obviously, if I let them get really close, sometimes they get it, you know?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "So, they're enjoying it."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?"}, {"time": 3085, "text": "And that was kind of like the start, because I had to figure my way out of bad positions, because I had to try to make it entertaining for them, where they still got something out of it, and they wanted to come back the next week."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And I also got something out of it."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Yeah, I love this, yeah."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "Because that relationship is so important, with that, like, that, I've had a few drilling partners, training partners that were really important to my life, and I always wonder why it's difficult, why it's so difficult to find them."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like I, if anyone's listening to this, I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "Getting the reps with people is hard."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "Even in jiu jitsu, that, it's just like, people want to do the fun stuff."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "They don't want to really put in the work, and it takes a certain kind of personality."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And then you also have to make it fun for the other person, just like you said."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "If there's a skill mismatch, but also if you have an interest mismatch, in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do, all that kind of stuff, you have to figure out ways to make it fun."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "So you did."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So, yeah, I think I did that, and no one told me."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "As I get some, I get frustrated, because now we have, just in my academy, we probably have 50, 60 high school kids only that are year round."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "They're year round."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Maybe they're not consistent in the summer or whatever, but they're there."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "So when they don't have a great partner, they start whining, and it's like, you little bitches, like, you know."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Some days they get really mad about it, because it's like, I had no partners."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "You guys, there's still 22 people in the room."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you, but like, go work out with that dude."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So what was the switch, the change?"}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Was it gradual, or?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "Gradual."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Yeah, so I was in ninth grade."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "I quit football, because I wanted to get really serious."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "What position in football were you in?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "I was actually a nose tackle."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "But at that point, so, okay, so I was also, the other thing I kind of left out here, I was really fat growing up."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat, and if I want to be a competitive wrestler, I shouldn't be fat, because weight matters."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So I was pretty small, too, but I was also slow, unfortunately."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So they put me a nose tackle."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "So that's where you wrestled, 119?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "My freshman year, yeah."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success state wise, but not nationally."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "It's my national success, didn't come to my junior year in high school."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And then senior year, I started having a lot of success nationally, and I got recruited."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "But then even when my freshman year of college, this is where I loved competing, I would go every weekend."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "Because I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition, all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them, and then figuring out what you need to work on."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman, which is incredibly rare."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "I had 10 losses."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "So it's not, and like to not so great guys, you know?"}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So like my skill level still at that point was not that great."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And then the next year I came out and I made it into the finals."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "So my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year to the real freshman year."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So a few questions."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "Where did the funk style of wrestling, the creative stuff get developed, at which stage?"}, {"time": 3284, "text": "So I think like looking retroactively, there was no intention to start when I was in high school with those kids, but I think that's kind of like, well, what was happening, right?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So what I would really say is, I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college named Mike Ironman, great guy."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "I had this burning desire to be the best."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room, cause we had, you know, Tyron was there, we had All American 157, we had All American 184."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "So I wasn't having a ton of success."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And very quickly I realized from like a more traditional athletic perspective, strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with anyone."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "I was way worse."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?"}, {"time": 3327, "text": "You know, I want to do this."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "How do I do this?"}, {"time": 3329, "text": "There's gotta be a way, you know?"}, {"time": 3331, "text": "So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things, but then it was just like this creative expansion for the next, you know, say three to five years."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And then even now it's like, I don't know, there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo, or there's something that's like fun about the way the body moves and works and exploring something new and thinking about, hey, wrestling's been happening at a relatively high level for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "And there's still new things being developed."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "And so when you see something new, you're like, oh damn, like, that's great."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Or like Jason Knowles may have to win Dixie."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "I'm like, how did I not think of that shit?"}, {"time": 3367, "text": "Like, why did I think of that?"}, {"time": 3368, "text": "So easy, I should have thought of that, you know?"}, {"time": 3371, "text": "So there's this like obsession with the sport of wrestling and positions where I actually think sometimes, thank God we didn't have smartphones because I may have been distracted by my smartphone."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Maybe I wouldn't have been because I was so obsessed, but maybe, but you know, some days I had, couldn't finish the single leg on a specific person or maybe they were finishing on me and it was like, go home and I was just fucking obsessed about that one position."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Like, okay, what am I missing here?"}, {"time": 3398, "text": "And not just accepting like that whatever the coach says is the answer, but like, what am I missing?"}, {"time": 3403, "text": "What ways can my body move that no one's told me it can move yet?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Where can my arms go, right?"}, {"time": 3410, "text": "Where can I do all these things?"}, {"time": 3411, "text": "And so I would just obsess about these things."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day and you say, oh, well maybe this, you know, and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, maybe it works twice and it doesn't work the next time."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And so you kind of like have this creative process and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things that are on the cutting room floor that never made it to the light because you thought they'd be good and they failed and they sucked."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "And then, you know, to the point where, like my senior year, I got to this point where the people, then they were just figures."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Figures would wrestle in my head about positions I was thinking about."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "I wouldn't tell them what to do."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "They would just, they'd just go in my head."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "And then like, oh fuck, wait, that's it."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "That's it, like that just happened."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "That's the move and then I'd go try to practice and sure enough, boom, that's the move."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "That's exactly what you have Alpha Zero playing, learning chess."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "You have, it's called Self Plays."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "You have, did the figures have like a clear?"}, {"time": 3463, "text": "No faces, they were just like."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Did they have a human form or is it just like stick figures essentially?"}, {"time": 3468, "text": "Yeah, it was not like humans."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "It was more like stick figures."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "They weren't stick figures exactly like they were."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "They had some volume?"}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Yeah, it was like a gray person and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially so I had to see how the things moved and yeah."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind at Google are, I don't know if you've seen, but there's something called reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence where you have like, they've done it for like sumo wrestling."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "You have like, you have these two stick figures that don't even know how to get up at first and they figure out how to stand on their two feet and then they figure out how to push the other person off of the pedestal."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Wait, so, but what about like when you look at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "So are they doing that same program or no?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded so it's not learning the, all of the sophisticated movements and strategies like high level strategies and movement, that's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do and if it does it, like the parkour stuff, that's all hard coded in."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "People like project and think like these robots have like discovered like how to move in sophisticated ways they haven't."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "Well, that's what, when you and John were talking about the grappling robot."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chess, right?"}, {"time": 3566, "text": "If a chess piece moves, right?"}, {"time": 3568, "text": "The horse can move like an L, right?"}, {"time": 3571, "text": "It can only move like an L. It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second or seven meters per second."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "It can only move there, right?"}, {"time": 3578, "text": "Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "I can shoot at different angles."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?"}, {"time": 3588, "text": "I can shoot with my head up versus my head, I mean, right?"}, {"time": 3591, "text": "All these things are gonna matter."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "We're talking about a human being defending the single leg."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "All of those things are gonna matter and that's where human beings who wrestle are calculating those things subconsciously."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head, oh, the force is coming at me at this, so I need to do that, right?"}, {"time": 3607, "text": "They're just doing it because."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely, if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling, you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves and the power that it's able to deliver."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "So that presumably, that'll be the limitation."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "But then, so if we go human, max force, we're Jordan Burrows double, max force, right?"}, {"time": 3630, "text": "That's the highest, that's the highest we get and then we go down from there."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "Even within that, it's like sometimes, I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of, I don't know, we'll just say 20 is the number, right?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "I don't know, I'll shoot it at 20 because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15, sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Because you feel something in your opponent that makes you do it differently."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So they would have to learn how, and then all of these different things and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "So the robot would have to learn all of these different incoming inputs to the system and then create this reaction."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "Oh no, no, no, 100%."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "So this would be all continuous."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "So unlike chess, it would not be, it's just chess is discrete, there's, it's."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "One and then."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "You move, it's a very specific set of moves."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Now here you would, those are all variables you control and they're continuous variables."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So the speed, the force, there's actuators, so there's all these joints, right?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "But you can move."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "I mean, it's just an optimization problem."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "It's kind of, and it's fascinating."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So I've been fascinated thinking about it since you guys talked about it."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "It was a long time ago, I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago and I've kind of been like obsessing about it ever since."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "Yeah, it just changes when, so unlike boxing, for example, or striking, once you grab a hold of somebody, it changes, you're now one body, right?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So it's very complicated."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "I think that's the really interesting thing about humans is we're able to do all of this calculation."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Subconsciously."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Yeah, subconsciously."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of for a robot, it's just there's so many things."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "The big problem is ethically, I don't know how many people are willing to train with a robot because you're gonna get hurt."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Well, couldn't you make a robot train as a robot or no?"}, {"time": 3816, "text": "Yes, but then it's expensive."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "So, because they're gonna get."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "Put the padding on that thing."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "I know, but then it's not, you know, it's, then you're not capturing the full."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them, you know, something for that effect?"}, {"time": 3834, "text": "You could, I mean, you could, you could."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "I mean, you're talking about robots that are, these are humanoid robots, so we're talking about $500,000 million robots."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "So, you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money because you have to have them wrestle for like a lot."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "To get better."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "Yeah, to get better."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "And then, the open question is how long does it take to get good enough to be a human?"}, {"time": 3872, "text": "I don't think we understand, I don't know, I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "Like, is it a really hard problem?"}, {"time": 3879, "text": "Like, what's harder, chess or wrestling?"}, {"time": 3881, "text": "Wrestling, by far."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "That's, yeah, that's the sense I have."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And possibilities, so once I shoot the same leg, now you have X amount of choices."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Once you make your choice, now I have a choice, X amount of choices."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "Now you have X amount of choices on the defense, and we can just keep going back and forth, right?"}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And this number becomes."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "Yeah, but the same happens with chess."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Correct, but then in wrestling, you have to make these movements very instantaneously, right, because if I shoot a single leg, I'm not gonna wait and say, what's your defense?"}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Right, you have to be instantaneously."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And then, also, again, based on the force and the vectors and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "So really, you know, if you're saying, well, I can shoot a single leg, it's not like moving the chess, it's not one move, right?"}, {"time": 3924, "text": "If you want to talk about different forces and stuff, it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves based on how hard I shoot it, the angle, the direction, all of those things."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Yeah, but wait a minute."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "People probably know the physiology of this, but the reaction speed for a human is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that, I don't know, from sensation to, like, from the signal traveling up to your brain and down, I don't know what that number is, but robots certainly could do it way faster."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "You would actually have to, like, constrain the speed."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people, right, so, yeah, theoretically, they could eventually beat wrestlers, but you asked what was harder, wrestling or chess."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Yeah, and I think wrestling is, because of the time component in it and the physicality of, you know, is it this force or that force, you know?"}, {"time": 3978, "text": "Because if I'm gonna say we're in a seatbelt side by side, right, a wrestling seatbelt, not in Jiu Jitsu, based on the pressure you're giving me, I might do a bunch of different things, right?"}, {"time": 3987, "text": "And so, like, to an untrained eye, they might both look like the same thing from you."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "To a trained feel, it's like, well, in one case, it's really evident I should go this way, in another case, it's really evident I should go that way."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "So the other thing to consider, just like with chess, the AI systems, so human versus human play a certain way together."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "They actually haven't considered a really large number of strategies that AI systems discover."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "So one possibility with a robot, they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "That, like, will dominate no matter what the human does."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "You think that, so you think there's that, so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking about with the wrestling, so fun is there's, even after 80, 90 years, there's this continuous evolution."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "So you think."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "There'll be some, like, low single type thing, like John Smith type of situation."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "Well, like a down block go behind is something that has really, I would say really in the last fiveish years has really been evolved."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "What's a go behind?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "Down block go behind, so when you shoot, well, they just, head inside or head outside matters, but there's one for both."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "And then, so that was kind of in existence when I was in college, right?"}, {"time": 4054, "text": "You down block them and you stop, but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "And now, immediately, you shoot and I attack that shoulder and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?"}, {"time": 4063, "text": "And so, like, that in its current incarnation, it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "I would say it probably became popular five to seven years ago."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "So yeah, there's these big things that are happening."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "Now I really wanna roll back because I wanna be ahead of the game."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "I wanna know what I'm missing."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces much more than humans do."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "So it'll give you a piece."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And not only does it give you a piece, it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Because it knows that that's better for the long term."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "So like humans rarely sacrifice without getting the piece back, like two or three moves after."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "Alpha Zero can wait like five moves."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "So basically you'll have, potentially with wrestling, you might have a robot that like puts itself in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way then that will actually turn out."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Lures the opponent in to trap."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "That's what my style is based on."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "You basically narrow, one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "You put yourself in a bad position, but it narrows the set of choices."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "For them, because they're not used to it."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "Yeah, they're not used to it."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And then you drag them into your, yeah."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "So, but there's also, the problem is there's mechanical issues."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Like it's actually just difficult to build robots that are able to sense, because we have sensation throughout our body, yeah."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "It's just difficult to build that kind of robot."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "It's expensive."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "You start talking about multimillion dollars, and then people start asking you questions."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "Why did you invest all of this money?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "They wanna see what moves they do, duh, hello."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "It could be a better investment."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "So I mentioned John Smith."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "He is, if people don't know, one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "He's also creative like you."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "He spoke really highly of you."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "Did you guys ever work together?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So you know what, when I was a senior, and I had the people wrestling in my head, I was lucky enough to be doing, I was pretty much a graduate, so I did an independent study with the sports psychology."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I was potentially going to go to grad school for sports psychology."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "Well, I actually did nine credits, and then I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "I continued learning on my own."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "But I had an independent study with the guy who's the head of USA Track and Field Sports Psych."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "So here was the class was, I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour, and he was like fascinated by me."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So he didn't let me do homework."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "It was like the greatest three credits ever."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "We just talked."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "I learned so much."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "But so I started, so one time it came up, I had these robot, or people wrestling in my head, and he said, well, who else do you think, but John Smith happened."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "So I went and got John Smith's number, and I called him and said, hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?"}, {"time": 4232, "text": "And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching, they went away."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Same thing happened to me."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "As soon as I started coaching, they went away."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "So if I really force myself now, and I'm like, I see something in practice, and it's really higher level, because high school wrestling, I don't want to, maybe I feel bad, but it's a little bit lower level, right?"}, {"time": 4248, "text": "So if Keegan, for example, who won the tournament, if he's struggling with a problem or asks me a question, and I can force myself to see the bodies moving and think about it again, kind of like I was in early age, but it won't just flow there anymore."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head, how are they generating new ideas?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "Are they just kind of?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "You tell me."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "So it's just, they're just scrambling in your head?"}, {"time": 4284, "text": "It would be specifically based on a problem I was struggling with, or a specific position, you know?"}, {"time": 4290, "text": "It goes in for a single, and then go from there."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class, and I don't have to work that hard, because it's easy, right?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And yeah, I'm just sitting there acting like I'm looking at the board, and these guys are wrestling, and I'm watching them wrestle, and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "Is there somebody you look up to style wise?"}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "Probably Gable, or it's a Gable."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "John Smith, but after the fact."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So the problem with wrestling in my era was you couldn't watch it."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "There was no access, right?"}, {"time": 4326, "text": "It wasn't really available."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith, man, they're kind of hard to find, right?"}, {"time": 4331, "text": "There's a couple of them on YouTube, but I've obviously seen all of those, but in my era, there really wasn't any of it."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So it was hard to be a fan of something, and that's why wrestling has, the fans are going like this, because now you can flip on the Flow app, and you can watch something that's happening in Europe, right?"}, {"time": 4349, "text": "We can do this easily, so we can be a fan of people."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then, because there just was no access."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "So now I can watch someone I like, and say, oh shit, that guy's wrestling."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "That type of thing."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "You know, and a quick rant."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "It's really frustrating that you can't watch the Olympics."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Oh my god, it's so frustrating."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on this point."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "Go to NBC's headquarters, I'll go with you."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "You got a soldier here."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro, he was surprised by this, too."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "Most matches, you can't see, even, you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steelers, and you can't see the full match."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "You get like a crappy highlight."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "So the two biggest things, and really the three, the NCAA championships on ESPN, the Olympic trials are on NBC, and the Olympics are on NBC."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "And these companies are so big, they don't have a department dedicated to selling the rights to that footage, right?"}, {"time": 4411, "text": "So the rights to wrestling footage, which no one really cares all that much about, except a niche, are the exact same as track and field, or basketball in the Olympics."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics, you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Yeah, old, the current film."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So you can't even watch the Gable match?"}, {"time": 4434, "text": "The Gable Steelers, no."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "They did a, you know, they do something that annoys the fuck out of me."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "So it's like they capture the most important thing, but it's all about the buildup."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat, and the nerves, and you walk out, and like that, I mean, I don't know, you miss, then when the triumph happens, or the heartbreak happens, it has that much more power."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN, I'm happy to join that."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "I think I'm fortunate it's the IOC."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?"}, {"time": 4477, "text": "IOC is selling, for the Olympics, is the one that's making."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "Well, so NBC broadcasts, so they obviously have the live rights."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "You would think they would have recorded, if they, I mean, they're the ones recording it, you would think they keep the rights when you think."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "No, no, no, they're getting a license of it."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "They're getting exclusive like license, but like the, you know, for example, I've had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player, and there's a really sort of famous match, just a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics, where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "It's a 20 minute match to go to war, and that's not available anywhere, but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "The reason I know this is on the IOC channel."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "So they've uploaded all of these matches."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "They have it and put it up."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won, got put public, and so I don't know if it was private, it got put up on YouTube."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "I was allergic to it the week of my Jake Paul fight."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "It was so dumb."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "I'm like, why, this is 13 years later, this is bullshit."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Like this should have been up."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So, I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?"}, {"time": 4551, "text": "That has to be the USOC then or NBC?"}, {"time": 4555, "text": "So I know like, okay, so I know Flow, right?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Cause I worked with them."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "They buy the rights, generally in the contract, they'll have rights to both live stream it and then use that footage at any point moving forward."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So those matches live on Flow's website."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "That's why I would be surprised if NBC didn't have something similar."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "Flow does a pretty good job of providing like a place where you can watch all these matches."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "NBC does not."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Does not, yeah."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And also there's an argument with Flow as well, but certainly with Olympics."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "There's a difference between what Flow does and what the Olympics represent."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "Like it feels like the Olympics, which is what the charter says, should be as accessible as possible."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "Like you should really lower the barrier for entry for the Olympics."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "You know that's what the charter says, but those people in the IOC, these are the worst people ever."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "They're very bad."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "Well, they're not bad."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "They just lost touch of the dream they once had when they joined the IOC."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "Well, I would argue all the way back that these are rich fat cats who, like I get so mad about the NCAA, which finally now got rid of this bullshit term amateurism."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "It's like, well, there's some holy grail where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete, but the people who own the IOC or the people who own the institutions, college institutions are making boatloads of money off of you, that's crap."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "Did you believe you can win gold?"}, {"time": 4647, "text": "So your mental game was on point."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "Yeah, I was ready."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "This wasn't good enough."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "That was what I said."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time, it was my first year of international competition."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "So when I came out in 2007, it was my first time making 74 kilograms, which is pretty small for me."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around

my other guy that you asked earlier who I enjoyed watching, and that was a guy I, again, it was kind of after the fact because it was hard to access footage, but he was a lot of fun to watch."},

won six and three, six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total, which there's only one or two people above that."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him, but from what I've seen, his feel is different."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "He was just ahead of his time, and the feel and the touch he had for certain moves and different things, because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "He's taller than skinnier, which it can work in wrestling, but it is by less represented."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "So yeah, he was special, so

something specific about wrestling that can create so many great champions?"}, {"time": 4854, "text": "From that area?"}, {"time": 4855, "text": "So obviously they all love the big deal."}, {"time":

them, it is a way out right there."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "The elite level athletes in that part of the world, from my understanding, are really well compensated compared to what the average person makes and they're treated really well."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So people see it as a way out."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Whereas like, and then honestly, if America is getting better, but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA was because I didn't want to be poor my whole life."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "It sucked."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000 for the next 48 years."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "So I'm going to go do something else."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?"}, {"time": 4901, "text": "If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling, I probably would have kept wrestling."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "So I think there's factors and obviously now they have a really like, a bunch of really good people in one area."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So there's probably, and it's been going on for a long time."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "So there's probably been a bunch of like adults and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So yeah, a lot of those things that happen."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "So I'm definitely going to travel there to talk to them because I can speak Russian."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "It makes it very, makes me uniquely qualified to."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "My brother can speak a little bit of Russian."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Your brother can?"}, {"time": 4936, "text": "Okay, like a little bit like he swears and."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me oversell."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "I think he would be able to have a conversation with you."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Probably not like you."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "What's the, what's the reason he knows Russian?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "I don't know why he got obsessed with languages."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And so his college degree is actually, what are they called?"}, {"time": 4957, "text": "Interdis, where you have three minors."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish and maybe Japanese, I'm messing up."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "I don't know what the third one is."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling, like they don't really go super hard."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "Yeah, and I only spent a couple, so I was there, I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "That was where the World Cup was."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "We had to train there for like two days afterwards."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "So I didn't get to dig deep, dig deep into what was going on or anything."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe it to be really simple."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "If we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "If we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "There's all this gray area in the middle that's sparring, right?"}, {"time": 5017, "text": "So if you have a good relationship, like college me and my brother, we could just go and we know where each other's at."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "We don't even have to talk about it, right?"}, {"time": 5026, "text": "But like in my wrestling club, I'll say, okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot and this is for him, so I want him to go 70."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "So you're not supposed to be trying to win here."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "You're gonna go a little later."},

beneficial for success."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And I think that's, I mean, America's doing better than we've ever done historically."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "Well, that 70 and 40, that's like an art form to find that right place, because the really good people I've trained with, they go much closer to 100% speed wise, but without forcing things the way you would when you're going."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "It's some weird combination of things that, like if you truly earn a technique, then you're given that technique."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "But if you don't, you don't."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And then it becomes much less injury prone."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "You don't get stuck in positions."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "It's just a lot of movement."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about, like different ways to learn and get better."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "And so I think John obviously innovated within the sport of jiu jitsu."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "I think about it like."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "You have this academy and you sent me this plan."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "They have like a really well thought through plan for how to develop a good wrestler."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So I think it's, for me there's four categories, right?"}, {"time": 5116, "text": "There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "You're coming in and I'm showing you the move and you're literally going out there and you're trying."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "To me, that's not even drilling."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "That's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So obviously in someone's earlier periods, they're spending a lot of time in that phase because they literally don't even know how to move their bodies the right way."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling because you absolutely have to get those reps to become really proficient in that movement and then the sparring and then the live, right?"}, {"time": 5148, "text": "And so like, I think obviously by the time you get to the kind of, I don't wanna say end point, right?"}, {"time": 5153, "text": "But further on, the time you spend teaching is so, I don't wanna say, I'm sorry, in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant, but it's so much smaller because to someone who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years, I don't have to give this big long drawn out explanation."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently or just do this, right?"}, {"time": 5173, "text": "We don't have to spend any time there."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "So I think that's like something that consumes for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13, we're consuming a massive amount of time there on that teaching learning phase."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "But that makes total sense, right?"}, {"time": 5191, "text": "It's funny because when you look at like jiu jitsu schools, they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning and then the live, like there's not enough drilling."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "I like how you draw a distinction there because it feels like you're always starting from scratch."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "Like people have like very crappy short term memory."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "Like they're not, like the way teaching is done is you show a technique from scratch and it seems disjoint."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "It is for sure, especially if you have a class that's been with you for a while, you don't have to start from scratch."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "You can say, hey, let's focus on this one little thing here or let's, after we do this, let's do that, and you kind of put, start putting it all together."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "And then with jiu jitsu, the thing that I really struggled with was a couple of things."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu jitians, my personal experience through the sport."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And I actually found my, so when I unretired, I found someone really great that I loved and I really wish it was Mark Lehman."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "I don't know if you know him at all."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "I wish I would have found him earlier because he was just tremendous."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "But number one, there's no drilling."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "So it's like, in wrestling, I can boil down to, I can probably name you the best six moves, right?"}, {"time": 5260, "text": "So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "It always has been, I don't know, probably always will be, unless they figure out something different."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "The robot."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "The robot figures out something different."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "Because everyone's gonna do that, right?"}, {"time": 5278, "text": "So just like, say, an armbar or some type of sweep, right?"}, {"time": 5282, "text": "Why can't we go get 50 reps there?"}, {"time": 5283, "text": "Hey, by the time I've been in your jiu jitsu school for two years, I better know a fucking armbar."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "I better know it."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "Just tell me to go hit 50 reps. And then if, when I'm hitting my reps, if there's something I'm doing wrong, then just say, hey, Ben, move your leg a little bit that way or raise your hips up a little more, right?"}, {"time": 5301, "text": "Like, correct as you're drilling so you're getting all these reps at it so you're becoming more proficient."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "And then the other thing I really struggled with was, to your point during live, so many times it's just this five minute go, go, go."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "And that's not the most efficient way to learn because when you have two people, especially when they're focused on winning, and you say go, they're gonna go to wherever they do best."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something, I don't want you doing what you do best all the time."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "I need you doing some other things, right?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "If you have a great single leg but you can't shoot to the other side of the body, we need to work on that, right?"}, {"time": 5332, "text": "You need to start shooting the other side."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "There's some sense that you, it's not like you should be told what to work on but you should be told to work on the thing that you wanna work on."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "Meaning, I don't know, maybe you can comment on this, but everybody develops a different game as you get better and better."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "There's a set of things you need to be working on."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So I actually have, like when I, especially when I'm training very seriously, I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind and I have a sheet of paper on the side where I literally, my head keep counting off how many times I put myself in that position and pulled off the technique."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And that's all I care about in like training."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "So I'll just, whatever it is, if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine, arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don't, I love numbers, so I'll say like, I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags and I'm not getting off the mat until I do."}, {"time": 5389, "text": "And that, you know, if it takes."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "Any thrilling or live contest?"}, {"time": 5393, "text": "So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now is the live contest."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "But drilling, obviously, drilling."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "So I feel like I can't find a drilling part, like it's so hard to find drilling partners, even."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "It's annoying to me that this is boring."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "And there's nothing more annoying to me than the look of boredom on another person's face when we're drilling."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "It's like, don't you."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?"}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Cause you said it's a job."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "And he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "Why am I, am I an idiot?"}, {"time": 5421, "text": "Or why is this drilling beneficial?"}, {"time": 5423, "text": "Well, let's go with two trick questions."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "Why is it so beneficial?"}, {"time": 5428, "text": "I think for me, it's, there's a meditative aspect to it where the more you drill, the more you start noticing the details."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "Let me push back a little bit here."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "I'm not going to push back all the way."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "Cause every time, if I was wrestling, I'll warm up my head, crotch, shin, leg, whatever, right?"}, {"time": 5449, "text": "But even, so say like at a high level when I'm really wrestling, say 10 years ago, even during that drill portion, if we talk about the resistance of our opponent from zero to 100, it's very likely that my partner at that point, and this is people I'm really comfortable with, they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?"}, {"time": 5467, "text": "They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl or, you know, I got to get through their hands."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "If I don't set it up right, they might put their arm down, right?"}, {"time": 5474, "text": "So it's like, we are drilling cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level, but there's a little bit of sparring."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "Yeah, so that's not really drilling."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "Cause I think it's drilling."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "I think literally you're shooting and I'm just going boom, I'm like, show me your dummy, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "No, but it's very hard to be a dummy that doesn't do 20%, so you're going to do 20%."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "Yeah, that's so, so yes, that's 20%."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "So that's like sparring a little bit then."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "No, but they're not really resisting."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "They're just giving you the right frame."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "They're giving you the right like movement and they're being an intelligent dummy, essentially."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "I mean, but also like the really important component of this is you pick the techniques for which is beneficial."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it, you don't want to be doing that with, I'm saying like there's certain moves and I like those moves and I select the game base in those moves."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "So are you drilling to get better or are you drilling just to work out?"}, {"time": 5532, "text": "No, to get better."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "That's what I'm trying to tell you."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "I believe you can become like exceptionally good very fast by drilling."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "But how?"}, {"time": 5542, "text": "First of all, let me ask you an empirical question."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times a particular move?"}, {"time": 5551, "text": "You haven't drilled millions."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I think you're just saying numbers."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "I don't think you know what 100,000."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "The numbers are freaking astronomical."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "It's way more than 10,000."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "Dude, there was a 10 year period where I wrestled every single day."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "That's 3,000 days, so you're telling me 10,000, that's only three of them a day."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "I do way more than that."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Three of them."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "Probably 30 of them a day."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "That's 100,000."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "Yeah, hundreds of thousands."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "I did, for sure, 100%."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Because some days I might do 100, right?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "So 30 of 30 is not very many."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "Especially if we count all reps, if we're counting drilling and live."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot and I just hated it."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "You shoot a high crotch, we'll start."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Coach wants to drill a high crotch."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "Okay, we'll start."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "You shoot the high crotch, that's great."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "Then I'm gonna sit the corner or I'm gonna give you my hip or I'm gonna try something."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "So then you have to react."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And I would argue that all skill level past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5616, "text": "It's back and forth."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5618, "text": "I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5619, "text": "And you have to start unconsciously programming these things in your head."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "Because if you're too conscious to think about it, it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it at math."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "But the drilling is the unconscious programming."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "But the simple movement, the first simple movement, the first simple movement, that single leg or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "Like I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain at doing other things around it."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "No, but that's the key word, you feel."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "That's your opinion."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "If we did a study on it, then I would be proven correct."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "No, perhaps."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "So first of all, your brain, as an exceptionally creative combat athlete, it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Like it's obvious that you have like, you're such a creative energy that you're just not going to be somebody who's going to enjoy that."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So enjoyment is probably having an active mind is really important."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And I have that mind."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "Like I can."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "But do you really think, okay, so if you're, let's pick a technique."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "What technique do you want to drill on?"}, {"time": 5693, "text": "Are we doing jiu jitsu or wrestling?"}, {"time": 5696, "text": "It's hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "Let me think, just guard pass."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Okay, so you have a guard pass and you get it to be, I'd say nine and a half out of 10, right, just from a technical standpoint."}, {"time": 5709, "text": "Don't you think you need some resistance to feel?"}, {"time": 5712, "text": "Because essentially all benefit after that is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?"}, {"time": 5718, "text": "And if they shift that way, do I need to sink here or move there?"}, {"time": 5721, "text": "So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing, but maybe terminology wise."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "Well, the split is the important thing."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "Like how much of each?"}, {"time": 5730, "text": "So I think it is spar."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "Like I think it's a very light touch spar is what you're talking about, which is in my opinion, really isn't drilling."}, {"time": 5738, "text": "And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency, I don't think brings much value."}, {"time": 5743, "text": "But that's what I'm trying to tell you is I think it does."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "I think doing that same movement, I think you begin to learn more over time."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "Like you're saying like once you get the basic proficiency, then there's a diminishing returns."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "I think everything has diminishing returns when you're learning a technique."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling, if you can have way more gains over here, why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?"}, {"time": 5776, "text": "If this other area, if you're spending so much time here that this other area is left unexplored, you can make gigantic gains over there."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "No, but you're gonna lose."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "I think a lot depends on your style."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "I think a lot is determined by how good you are at one thing."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing and then make your whole game where it's all pulled into that system, then I don't know."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "I think one is too small of a number."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "Yeah, it's small."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I feel like you can't be easily this, like I've."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "Funnels."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "Funnels, right?"}, {"time": 5811, "text": "Where everything goes into a few positions."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And then it's all field."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "Where I feel you win 100%."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy 80% of the time and 20% of the time live rolling with people worse than you."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Like a little bit worse than you."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "Or a lot worse than you."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Yeah, so I think, I definitely think."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "So my buildup would be teach."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "So we're talking a complex technique, right?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "So by the time we're talking about, we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient, he's probably done the drilling part."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So then now it's like, okay, if I wanna get something new to you, I'll probably tell you, you'll probably be able to do the basic premise within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?"}, {"time": 5855, "text": "Do this, okay, they do it."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "Then it's like, okay, so now here from here, what we're gonna do, we're gonna go light sparring."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So I know you have success."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "Cause I need you to complete the task in order to get better at it."}, {"time": 5864, "text": "That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up, is they just wanna go with the toughest person."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "But if you go with the toughest person, you're not gonna actually execute on any skills."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "You're gonna get a workout and I need you to execute cause I need you to get good at this."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "In order to get good at it, you have to get all the way through the technique."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "Why do you need them to complete?"}, {"time": 5878, "text": "Just so they gain confidence in the technique or they go through all this stuff?"}, {"time": 5881, "text": "They have to feel all the way through."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "Like if I said, learn a high crotch when you're drilling but stop halfway every time."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "But you're not actually gonna be able to do it cause you're gonna stop, you're not gonna feel."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "So, you know, try it on someone, spar lightly, get it."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Do it on someone who's not as good as you, get it."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Then kind of work your way up the ladder so you can get it on someone your own skill level or maybe better than you, right, in a live competition."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So it's like, I don't know, I feel like that basic drilling, so a kid like Keegan who I've brought up a few times, I feel like if there's something new, I could literally tell him, this is what I want you to do and he's such a great feeler, he could go drill it proficiently within probably a minute or two."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "But then to hit it on someone high level, that's gonna take quite a while longer."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "And that's a mix of drilling and sparring on people a little bit worse than you."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "Yeah, and then equal and then better, yeah."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Yeah, because there's this, with grappling, there's such like a feel component to the pressure, the movement, all these things."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And there's still, like I said, there's so many things you can throw at someone out of one position, not just moves, but moves at a different level of force or whatever."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Are you and these kids developing like a big picture strategy of like, what are the main setups and take downs and just like a whole system?"}, {"time": 5961, "text": "So I kind of sent you our technique book, right, how we kind of go at approach it."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "So I think in wrestling, you're going to need, you're gonna need a handful of things just off the word go, right?"}, {"time": 5974, "text": "You're going to, so I think on our feet, I need to be able to take this out of the body."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "I need to be able to take that out of the body."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "I need to be able to bring you underneath me."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "I need to be able to go around you, right?"}, {"time": 5984, "text": "Now we can accomplish those different ways, but we should have all of those weapons if we wanna be really good some way, right?"}, {"time": 5991, "text": "So if I neglect one of those, so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down, right?"}, {"time": 5994, "text": "Front lock you."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "Now, if I have a good shot and you're smart, you're just gonna lower your stance."}, {"time": 5999, "text": "So my shot is not gonna be as successful and I have the inability to pull you down, right?"}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So I kind of need all of those so I can, as they get better, I can point those things out."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "On bottom, my folks at bottom, there's certain things like you have to be good at leg right defense, right?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "You have to, I mean, at a high level or you're just gonna, when you get it in, you're just getting stuck there."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "Not gonna be able to escape."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things that you can choose from and I'm gonna, depending on your body style and what you're good and bad at, I'm gonna probably develop something a little different."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod, you'd be better at the knee slide, whatever."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "Yeah, top, kind of same thing."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "I have to ask you about Khabib."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "So I remember a while ago Rogan said that that's the perfect fight for Khabib, you are."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "So let me ask two questions."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match when you're at your peak?"}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Yeah, I don't like, yeah, I mean, it's one of those people where people will get really mad at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, I think."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "But how would you do it?"}, {"time": 6063, "text": "How would you solve that puzzle?"}, {"time": 6065, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we would grapple and I think I would be better than him."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "But you know, sometimes I feel weird saying this, people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And, but that's no one out grappled him, right?"}, {"time": 6078, "text": "I mean, nobody did."}, {"time": 6078, "text": "And maybe I'm wrong on this, but if we look at the best possible candidates, I'm definitely one of them."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "And then obviously I have a small size advantage too."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "So in a wrestling match, so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "What do you think is the right strategy on him?"}, {"time": 6095, "text": "Like, do you understand his style, his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?"}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?"}, {"time": 6104, "text": "Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately, fought any real, who I would say, really, really high level wrestlers."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "I was actually really disappointed how bad Justin Gaethje's wrestling was, because Justin Gaethje had some solid success, but his wrestling was really bad in that fight."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "Gaethje had success in the NCAA?"}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Yeah, I think he was seventh place, maybe, or somewhere."}, {"time": 6123, "text": "He was definitely all American."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "It was lower though."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt with someone who was like, who I think, oh man, this guy's a really high level wrestler."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "Because we saw, and this is early in his career, but Gleason Tebow did give him some issues earlier in his career."}, {"time": 6141, "text": "So I would like to see him in that situation and see how he does."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "I would love to, I just love wrestling and grappling."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "Yeah, I'd love this."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "Someone said, hey, Ben, Khabib wants to roll with you."}, {"time": 6150, "text": "Okay, I'm there tomorrow."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "It sounds like a blast."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "He's probably competitive as hell."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "You're still competitive?"}, {"time": 6157, "text": "I know when to be and when not to be."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Say if I'm going to high school kids, or I'm not going to be competitive because then I'm just being a dick."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "How would you take him down?"}, {"time": 6169, "text": "What are we talking about, real wrestling?"}, {"time": 6169, "text": "Like wrestling, wrestling?"}, {"time": 6170, "text": "Wrestling, wrestling."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "I would probably try to take single legs and stuff."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "Single legs?"}, {"time": 6175, "text": "I haven't, okay."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "None, none."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "No, honestly, I don't have the slightest clue."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "I'd have to feel, I'd feel him out."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "But single legs is my best take on it."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "People talk about his wrestling being really good."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "People that train with him."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "So, okay, so I grilled someone, I will not say who, on the Ed Ruth thing, because Ed Ruth is very elite at folk style wrestling."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?"}, {"time": 6199, "text": "They were on the same team for a while, yeah."}, {"time": 6201, "text": "And there was rumors that Khabib beat him up."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "And I said, I sure can't believe that."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And I've heard that that was, if they were just straight wrestling, Ed would get slightly the better of it."}, {"time": 6213, "text": "Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "He's great."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "So that was what I heard."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "But in an MMA setting, because of all the tools that Khabib would get him."}, {"time": 6227, "text": "But I agree."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "I agree with Rogan on this one."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "That would have been good to see."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "Yeah, I'm fine."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I'd love it."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "I love wrestling and grappling."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "I don't do much Jiu Jitsu because I just don't have time for it anymore."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "I'm at the Wrestling Academy like every single day."},

style?"}, {"time": 6255, "text": "Oh, wrestling."}, {"time": 6255, "text": "Wrestling."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "Well, I will say my knowledge past like the year 2000 is really not that great."},

anything, you know?"}, {"time": 6270, "text": "And so you hear of all these."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "So you need evidence?"}, {"time": 6272, "text": "You need direct evidence?"}, {"time": 6273, "text": "I want to be able to watch them and see them and feel the times and feel their opponents and all those things to really like, I hate giving bad answers, you know?"}, {"time": 6280, "text":

footage."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "You can't find anything on him, you know?"}, {"time": 6290, "text": "It's like, who is the wrestler?"}, {"time": 6293, "text": "So post 2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "Americans, Russians?"}, {"time": 6301, "text": "Oh, it's just that T.F."}, {"time": 6301, "text": "has probably the best argument post 2000."}, {"time": 6304, "text": "Yeah, the Russian tank, that guy is, yeah."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "So who's better, Snyder or Sajilov?"}, {"time": 6311, "text": "So Sajilov just won at the Olympics."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "Now, I understand this."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "I don't understand how that works, but it's pretty close, right?"}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Not that match, but in general, the matchup."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "Sajilov pinned him the following year."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "But then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19."}, {"time": 6328, "text": "And then just lost."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "I don't want to say fairly decisively, but it was six to three and it was a late take down."}, {"time": 6335,

enough people talk about Sajilov."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?"}, {"time": 6357, "text": "You think Kyle should go to MMA?"}, {"time": 6359, "text": "Some of these guys."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "Yeah, they're making enough money in wrestling where they don't really feel the need to."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "It's terrifying though."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "It's a heavyweight, Sajilov would probably, it's like Khabib, but heavyweight."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "Well, I don't know if you remember, do you remember Bilal Makov?"}, {"time": 6372, "text": "So Bilal Makov actually was the Russian representative in both styles in 2016, Greco and freestyle."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "And he was, to my knowledge, the only person the UFC has ever signed that was zero and zero, in modern era, signed that was zero and zero."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "And then he actually never ended up fighting."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "But weird, right?"}, {"time": 6389, "text": "No motivation."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "I don't know what the story is."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "Cause sometimes out of Russia, I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "Like they're a world champ or a little big champ and then all of a sudden you're like, wait, where'd he go?"}, {"time": 6402, "text": "You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "Oh, what'd I say?"}, {"time": 6406, "text": "I forgot, but I think."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Steroids."}, {"time": 6409, "text": "I think somebody's gonna show up to your door."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "I'm worried."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "I honestly, I've said enough bad things where I would be a kind of looking over my shoulder if I wanted to do something."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "I, for one, love the Russians."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "What about Icarus?"}, {"time": 6424, "text": "It's fake news."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "It's propaganda?"}, {"time": 6429, "text": "I don't know what it is anymore."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "You know, it's troublesome, man."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "I hate cheating in all of its forms."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo that stood out to you?"},

point where we're gonna compete with Russia every single year in wrestling, which obviously, you know, long, long time ago, many, many years ago we were great."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "And then kind of after that Soviet Union period, I think there was a lot of poverty in that area."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "And that kind of led the wrestling team going down a little bit."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And then obviously a lot of those regions, the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea, I believe."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "And they've been really kind of on the upswing for the last 20 years."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "And now America really, since 2012, has been on the upswing in wrestling."}, {"time": 6479, "text": "And we're kind of really competing with them."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And they're not sending a couple of their best guys."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "So for those who don't know, the Olympics moved back a year."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "So they are hosting the 2021 World Championships, despite the fact that we just had the Olympics two months ago."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "So it's happening next week in Oslo, Norway."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "So like Russia's not sending their number one at 57 and their number one at 65."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "So it's like, America's probably gonna win, I think."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I don't wanna guarantee anything, but there's a really good chance of it."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "Is Dave Taylor, all of those guys, competing?"}, {"time": 6508, "text": "America gave any of the Olympians that medaled the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off."}, {"time": 6513, "text": "They just got to keep the spot since it was two months later if they medaled."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "So the only one who's not is Gable."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "Gable's moving on."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "We have a pretty good guy behind him."}, {"time": 6521, "text": "Nick Wisniewski is a world medalist."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "But then he's, so Burrell's filled in the 79 spot."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot, who's a world champion also."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "So we have a pretty good squad."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "A hell of a team."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "Pretty good squad, yeah."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "Pretty good squad."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "Pretty happy."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "So given your run in Bellator in one championship, that was like one of the most dominant runs in MMA."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "What would you say was like key to your dominance in that long undefeated streak?"}, {"time": 6548, "text": "Huh, probably consistency would be one."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "The fact that I just, I lived and trained the same way no matter where my life was, whereas a lot of fighters, once they start making money for the first time, they have all these obligations and they travel and they really enjoy making money."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And that's kind of why some of them fall off."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "So you had like the same process, like the same camp."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "Yeah, I stayed at my house."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "I didn't vacation, yeah, everything."}, {"time": 6573, "text": "Just, you know, and so that was a big part of it."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "Obviously the style thing is like, no one could, there was only a few people who could stop my style."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "And I think I continue to get better as a mixed martial artist."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "And I wasn't as innovative in mixed martial arts, but there was a handful of things that I innovated, you know, specifically in the top position where I spent a lot of time where it was just like, there was just, once I got on top of you, it was like in a spider web and there was just kind of no way out."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "You know, you never felt the certain things I was doing."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "And so people just, they gave up eventually."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "How's the level of wrestling in MMA would you say?"}, {"time": 6614, "text": "So I saw somewhere like champions, the most popular martial art for current UFC champions are all wrestling."}, {"time": 6624, "text": "So we just lost a bunch of the belts."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "Wrestling is a sport, right?"}, {"time": 6629, "text": "But yeah, at one point we had, I think it was eight of nine maybe or something to that effect."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "And I think it's not just wrestling, not just the actual martial art of wrestling that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts, but other things like the way we're systemized."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "So most kids who have all this have went through the high school program and the college program and they know how to show up on time and they know how to work hard."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever, they know how to show up on time and they know how to work hard and that's gonna get you a really long way."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "Just those two things, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "Those things."}, {"time": 6664, "text": "Then I think you throw on top of that the fact that most of us have competed 1500 to 2000 times, probably by the time we get to 20 something, like that's a huge advantage too."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Most of these other people from other disciplines maybe have competed 100, if that, right?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So we have this competitive process down really, really, really, really well."}, {"time": 6683, "text": "Plus the weight cut."},

you would, I don't wanna pick on jiu jitsu again, but how many jiu jitsu guys have became highly proficient in wrestling versus how many wrestling guys have became highly proficient in jiu jitsu?"}, {"time": 6699, "text": "I think that number swings one way and not that much the other way, you know?"}, {"time": 6704, "text": "So we're open to adapting and learning and for some reason, like jiu jitsu people, how many of them have got high level wrestling?"}, {"time": 6714, "text": "Or even mediocre wrestling, the number's really small."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "They refuse to, it's really frustrating."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "Why won't they do this?"}, {"time": 6721, "text": "This is obviously a part of it."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "I don't wanna pick on specific guys, but there's certain guys in the history of MMA where you're like, listen, man."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight, is a great example of somebody who actually did get proficient in wrestling, right?"}, {"time": 6735, "text": "But there's some of these jiu jitsu guys who's like, if you just got on top, you would submit him."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "Why can't you learn a

that you mentioned, Craig Jones, they're big on wrestling as part of jiu jitsu now."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "Like wrestling, not just on the feet, but wrestling from the bottom coming up and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say, for a jiu jitsu person to learn?"}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Not that hard."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "If they really put their mind to it."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "Cause they already like, when you grapple, and this is any grappling art, like there's a certain part of it that you kind of get and it can, it might not be the exact same thing, but you understand how your body moves and how to feel certain pressures and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?"}, {"time": 6784, "text": "So I don't think, I think there's a certain level of stubbornness where they didn't want to, certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the I'm so macho, I can stand and bang thing, you know, where they want to show how macho they are."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they, there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient in jiu jitsu and really adapted and it doesn't go the other way."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "And then I guess the other thing there too is they can both steal from each other, right?"}, {"time": 6815, "text": "As any martial art can steal from another."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "And like, I feel like jiu jitsu didn't do enough stealing from wrestling."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possible and said, well, why don't we steal that and that and that?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "You know, and like, hey, let's take that over."}, {"time": 6828, "text": "And maybe we'd make a little tweak because it's different, but there's something we can definitely use there."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "So like in wrestling, for example, you know there's a one arm guillotine in jiu jitsu, right?"}, {"time": 6839, "text": "Okay, so there's a move called, well, it's got a hundred, I mean, it's like the oldest move in wrestling because it's what they did, the cows, where they go around the chin and they throw them on the back, how do we call that one?"}, {"time": 6848, "text": "Okay, sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?"}, {"time": 6852, "text": "Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck, throw it to the side?"}, {"time": 6855, "text": "No, but in wrestling, in wrestling."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "Okay, we call it that."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "Are you putting it under?"}, {"time": 6860, "text": "Yeah, so you can grab their chin and then you go under their arm and then throw them on their back."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "Yeah, so we call that the honey badger, but it's got different names, wherever you go, it's got different names."}, {"time": 6870, "text": "So I would always, I would say like pre Jiu Jitsu, I was average at it, like I could do it, but against good people, you'd never get it for, because they would get the back of their head up and they were too strong where you couldn't collapse them by going over their neck, right?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "Because the forces weren't right."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "So then in Jiu Jitsu, you learn the one arm gi team where you grab their chin and this is more of running along the side of their head and then you go here and you choke them, right?"}, {"time": 6895, "text": "Much more efficient way to move their head because the fulcrum is way down here and their head can move into that, right?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "So once I learned that in Jiu Jitsu, I'm like, wait, I can do this in wrestling."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "So now once I learn how to grab their chin the right way and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "I just had to steal that Jiu Jitsu, put it in wrestling and boom, there we go."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "But very few people steal any direction, that takes creativity."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "And open mindedness."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "It's so easy because it's already done, you just gotta steal it."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "I mean, same with Judo, if you're a gi Jiu Jitsu person, there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing because Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves on the transition, which is something Jiu Jitsu does not do."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "Because you have some."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "You mean from the take down to."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "From the take down, but also just in general, just in the transition, the concept of transition, the Jiu Jitsu is very much about we're in this position, then we're in this position, then we're in this position."}, {"time": 6956, "text": "The Judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "That's when you need to strike."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "And to learn that, I mean, that's why people like Travis Stevens and Judoka, when they go to Jiu Jitsu, they can dominate."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "But Jiu Jitsu people should steal that."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "They're too stubborn."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too."}, {"time": 6977, "text": "No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers."}, {"time": 6981, "text": "Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches, John Smith, Dan Gabel, they don't really have interest in MMA or Jiu Jitsu and so on."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "But you would think somebody like a John Smith would like put on a white belt and roll around."}, {"time": 6996, "text": "Yeah, I think he's just too focused on, you know."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "Well, he's a coach."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "Well, he's a coach and what he's doing."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger, he would have a lot of fun."}, {"time": 7006, "text": "We actually have a really good wrestler making his MMA debut tomorrow."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "I don't know if you, Bo Nickel, I'm sure you've heard of him, very high level."}, {"time": 7011, "text": "I think he's gonna have a lot of success."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "I mean, some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu makes you a little comfortable being in your back and for a wrestler, that could be like really bad."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "I hate that take."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "Yeah, but that's the Dan Gabel take."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "It's so stupid, it's so stupid."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "For God's sakes, we know the fucking rules."}, {"time": 7032, "text": "Just, in wrestling, you don't go to your back."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "In Jiu Jitsu, you can, it's like, whatever."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "But like, so Jiu Jitsu, for example, so I coached, when I was at Rufus, I coached the wrestling for a long, I don't know, three, four, five years."}, {"time": 7045, "text": "So I've been taking a Jiu Jitsu guy and teaching them a wrestling technique where you needed to use your feet."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "To teach a Jiu Jitsu guy, so easy, so simple, because they already understand the concept, butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?"}, {"time": 7059, "text": "To take a wrestler who's never done any of it and teach him how to use his feet, oh my God, it's such a beast, it's so hard, because that's not a weapon they're thinking about using."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "So it's like, we understand the rules."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "It's like freestyle folks are wrestling."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "Freestyle, if I'm on the mat, I can lock my hands."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "You don't see people locking their hands all the time in folk style just because they did freestyle."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "It's like, they get it."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "There's a rule, they understand it."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "So the notion that somehow you come from on your back."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "But pinning, that's like a, it has a special meaning."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "Yeah, but I actually think, so Jiu Jitsu, you don't actually wanna be flat, flat very often, right?"}, {"time": 7096, "text": "You don't wanna be."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "I always wondered this, because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments, and I did, I would put myself in butterfly guard, and I wasn't going against good people, so which is why I was doing all these things."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling where you're butterfly guard."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "So I think that there's a few places where I use it."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "But so specifically the Elevator Series, which my main series up bottom, it is, it's not butterfly guard."}, {"time": 7125, "text": "It's a butterfly guard grip with your foot."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot, boom, and I elevate you over, right?"}, {"time": 7133, "text": "And then also sometimes, I think Keegan does this too from watching me, but if I get double leg, sometimes if I'm accepting, so freestyle, obviously you're gonna give him points, you're gonna focus on accepting that you've already got me, and as I go down, I'm just gonna butterfly guard you up, and then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat, and end up in a wizard position."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "I've used that quite a few times, where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism that gets me back to maybe not a great position, but obviously much better than being taken down."}, {"time": 7164, "text": "Let me ask you quickly about crypto, because you're also, you have a show."}, {"time": 7170, "text": "You have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 7173, "text": "Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 7176, "text": "Is it just a financial investment, or is there a philosophy that

"text": "I fought in one championship, and he told me, and the second he told me, I'm like, oh, I'm so in, because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed."}, {"time": 7196, "text": "I had read, I kind of had an understanding how the Fed is unfair, and so when he told me about crypto, this decentralized system that no one has control over, it just made sense, and so we've had the podcast, to say Michael

engineers?"}, {"time": 7216, "text": "I think that's an easy choice."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "I don't even think, I don't even think I have to think about that."}, {"time": 7220, "text": "I don't trust politicians, no matter what country they come from, China, America, wherever, I don't trust them."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 7233, "text": "Are you, what do you find, which ones do you find interesting?"}, {"time": 7238, "text": "There's all kinds of ideas, there's the more sort of primal mechanism of proof of work and Bitcoin,

components of a lot of them."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "I understand what Bitcoin can do for people, and so that's probably the one I've focused the most on."}, {"time": 7263, "text": "And I actually, I think I was talking about, I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin because he hates it also, what he did last night."}, {"time": 7269, "text": "And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves, people in America are so American centric, they don't understand it."}, {"time": 7276, "text": "So like high levels of inflation, that hasn't happened in, it's starting to happen, it hasn't happened in America in a long time, right?"}, {"time": 7281, "text": "But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that, you know, or remittance payments, right?"}, {"time": 7287, "text": "Remittance payments to, you see it."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "So I saw this in, when I was spending all the time in Singapore, Singapore is obviously a really wealthy country, and so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino, and they would all go on Sundays, they would go to these places to ship stuff back to their families and through Western Union, Western Union gouges the shit out of these people."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "I mean, they're taking eight, 10, 12% of whatever they're sending, then it takes five days and the person's gonna go pick it up, whereas Bitcoin, I could send you Bitcoin person to person, right?"}, {"time": 7316, "text": "So like American people don't understand that."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "American people don't really understand the unbanked, right?"}, {"time": 7321, "text": "A decent portion of the world is unbanked, they don't have access to it."}, {"time": 7324, "text": "And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world doesn't have access to internet."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone, and we can send money person to person."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "So there's a whole bunch of those problems where Americans don't really think about that are really obvious that this solves."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "So I think that's a key one, obviously the fact that the value goes up is really outstanding also, but if you look at it, I got in in 2017, so I got to watch it go up."}, {"time": 7351, "text": "I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid."}, {"time": 7354, "text": "And then the majority of my time was spent through the bear market."}, {"time": 7357, "text": "And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided, not the fact that I actually lost money in the beginning and now I'm way up, but yeah."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "So I think that."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "And you're just holding."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "Just holding."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "I think at the top of this bull market, I'll probably sell a very small portion, just to."}, {"time": 7373, "text": "So you mean like right now there's a bull market?"}, {"time": 7376, "text": "Yeah, most people think say in the next three to six months we'll be at the top of the market."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "And so probably when that happens, I'll probably sell a little bit."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "You gotta hodl it, Ben."}, {"time": 7386, "text": "You gotta hodl."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "So here's what I am."}, {"time": 7388, "text": "So one of my podcast cohosts, he's like super rich, like super rich."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "So he has lost touch with the every man."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "So here's my argument to him, it's really simple."}, {"time": 7399, "text": "And listen, I'm doing well for myself in life, but if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right?"}, {"time": 7404, "text": "One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year."}, {"time": 7407, "text": "And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000, which is right around what a lot of people think the peak is going to be."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "They bought one Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "And they're living in a $200,000 house."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "So to take half of that, right?"}, {"time": 7422, "text": "You started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin, to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000 and pay off your house, your remaining house payment, that's life changing to someone."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "And so you still have a Bitcoin, so if Bitcoin goes to a million, you're still gonna have half a million, and you're gonna feel really, really rich with that half a million dollars because you bought it for effing $2,500, you know?"}, {"time": 7442, "text": "So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them because it could change your life."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And if you hold it and it goes down, you're going to feel the pain of that."}, {"time": 7456, "text": "Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially, it's much more psychologically difficult to ride the ups and downs."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "Yeah, it is for sure."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "So they have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "Actually, one of the main guys on our podcast, it's called Onchain Metrics."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "So all wallet transactions are visible, you know?"}, {"time": 7474, "text": "And so they have all these fun categories."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "So I think you said you don't like numbers, but."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "I like numbers."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "Oh, you love numbers."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "So I love numbers also."}, {"time": 7482, "text": "So they have all these different categories."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "Like you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin, or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "And so what they've seen during the downturn, so April it kind of peaked and went down, is that the whales are still buying."}, {"time": 7498, "text": "So whales, people of a thousand or more are still buying."}, {"time": 7501, "text": "They've said the main group of sellers is the ones who held it from zero to three months."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "So like they don't have money."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "They bought it because they thought it was going up."}, {"time": 7509, "text": "And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it, right?"}, {"time": 7511, "text": "Whereas anyone who's held it for a long time is generally still holding on to it."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "That's a good indicator, right, for the whole space."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "Well, let me ask you for some advice."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "You've been through one heck of a career, one heck of a life."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling's really a microcosm of what your life's going to be."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "And that's why one of the things I stress to kids is like, if we can go through this now and figure, I have a couple of kids who are struggling with certain things right now."}, {"time": 7540, "text": "If you can figure it out this now in wrestling, it's going to be a lot better to figure it out now and get over this mental hump than when you're 32 and you have two kids, right, and your job's not going well."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "It's going to be a lot worse."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "It's going to be a lot more painful then."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "Let's fucking figure it out now."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons we can learn from wrestling, whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic, or, you know what I said, wrestlers show up on time and they work hard, right?"}, {"time": 7563, "text": "These things, if we can learn these things at an early age, those are general, those characteristics will generally carry on throughout our life."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And those are the things that are going to make us really successful."}, {"time": 7572,

you can from them."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "And then if you can be successful at one thing, generally whatever that recipe was that took you to be successful at that, apply it to everything else,

want to live, doing a job you want to do, right?"}, {"time": 7600, "text": "There's so many possibilities and you just have to be bold enough to go take those chances."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "It's interesting because early on in life is when you have much more time."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "People don't realize it's time to learn the lessons."}, {"time": 7613, "text": "Like somehow later in life, you get busier, responsibilities and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "Like high school is a magical time."}, {"time": 7620, "text": "You're in college."}, {"time": 7621,

"Yeah, I don't have kids, but that still fills up."}, {"time": 7629, "text": "Well, no, I'm purpose."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "And I did something that many people don't seem to be able to do."}, {"time": 7633, "text": "I walked away from a lot of responsibilities."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "By saying goodbye."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "But meetings, everybody around me at MIT was like meetings fill the day."}, {"time": 7645, "text": "And then you have more projects and you do a great job and you become successful."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "And then the more meetings fill the day and more responsibilities as opposed to like, wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things?"}, {"time": 7658, "text": "And instead, do I want to find one or two things to really focus on?"}, {"time": 7663, "text": "And that's what I choose."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "But that becomes harder and harder and harder as you get older."}, {"time": 7670, "text": "No, I mean, I'm sure, and also the more success you have, you become sought after other places too."}, {"time": 7676, "text": "I'm sure that's happening with you."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "Saying no is hard."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "You're known for roasting people with a single boom roasted line."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "So any ideas, maybe you want

money."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And our capacity to do that is very much, is limited, first of all, because when there's a sale of a bond, when the government borrows more than it borrows money,

presented, we should be thinking like the higher, the better, the lower, the worse, I mean, of course, depending on the measure."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Well, in many cases, the conflict that

interest is education and innovation."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Yes, the classic cycle, the most important leading indicator is the quality of education."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Most importantly, broad based education drawn from the largest population because you can never tell who the talent is going to be."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So where are they gonna come from?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties, the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach, it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams and so on broad base of drawing in the populations."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And you see that if you go across societies because that draws on the largest number of population to get education."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And it also, that creates a reality and a perception that the system is fair, equal opportunity, not just one of privilege."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And that helps to create social stability."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "But education is not just education in understanding facts and so on, it is education in civility of how to behave together."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And so if they're smart, they understand how to be productive because they work well together and they're productive."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And then that leads to the next stage."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "You could see in the lines in the charts, I plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle, you could see that education is the long leading indicator."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And then you could see, as you mentioned, that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures then follow and you see then also competitiveness and world markets follows."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "For example, in the early stages of a cycle, the industries that they go into tend to be very basic industry because they have cheap labor, something like textiles and simple manufactured goods and so on."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But as the education rises, then they move up the value chain to greater technologies and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "So yes, those and as you say, there are 18 different measures like that, but education and then civility and the inventiveness."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So you see it reflected in who's inventing what."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And that corresponds then who's trading with, who's a big trading country and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes."}, {"time": 1427, "text":

your own insights along with the numbers."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "If you were to look at the American nation, the American empire and the trajectories looking into the future given these measures,

does that look like?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Well, all of those indicators are concerning, maybe except for one, which is technology, the technology niche, although even in that area, the United States is improving at a slower rate than is China for various advantages that they have there."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "They put out about eight times as many computer engineers they have free data and so on, but if you look at them, so the financial is a concern."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "The internal order, disorder is a concern."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Then if you look at education levels, the United States is in many ways is losing its educational advantage."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "If you were to look at, compare it with China, if you take general public education in the United States, it's deteriorated tremendously even in comparison to developed countries."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "There are scores, PISA scores and so on, and it's something like 38th in the world

universities in the world, so there are these privileged universities in the world, so there are these privileged spots that are, you know, excellent, uniquely excellent."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So when you look at the comparison, education in China is improving rapidly and the quantity is a quantity of educated people in the areas that they're moving in is greater and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater and so you see the results are greater, but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions, I think you know in terms of technologies, there are some areas that the United States is in a lead at the moment, there's some areas that China's in a lead, but China's gaining very

more than you spend and be strong in these ways and pretty much everything will take care of itself."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "But you make it sound simple of course because there's a momentum when things degrade, when the education system degrades, when you start borrowing, when I mean, all of these indicators, once they're going down, there's a momentum to it, right?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So it's hard to reverse it."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Right and there are circumstances that you're then in."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "For example, indebtedness."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "You know, it's politically desirable for those to borrow money and spend because their constituencies only look at what they get and when they get a lot, they don't pay attention to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "So it's always better to borrow, spend and then leave the cleanup to the next guy."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "And so you inherit a lot."},

more?"}, {"time": 1782, "text": "I mean, okay, that's not so easy."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "Spend less?"}, {"time": 1787, "text": "That isn't gonna work."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So now what do you do?"}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize and that's why it's classic."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So yes, that's why these cycles occur because what has created before, what happened before created the lay of the land that is then increasingly difficult to deal with."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So what can great leaders do in this moment?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "So for example, to do very large projects and invest in the education system that sort of try to fix the fundamentals or maybe invest more and more into the innovation and the development of new technologies and so on."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "It feels like that just doesn't happen organically."},

you?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "I think that that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 870, "text": "And then with VR today, even without eye tracking and knowing what your eyes are actually looking at, you can fake it reasonably well, right?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "So you can look at where the head pose is."}, {"time": 882, "text": "And if it looks like I'm kind of looking in your general

meeting friends or getting excited about stuff that is happening on the 2D digital plane."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "When do you think the Metaverse will provide those experiences for a large number, like a majority of the population?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Yeah, I think it's a really good question."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "There was someone, I read this piece that framed this as a lot of people think that the Metaverse is about a place, but one definition of this is it's about a time when basically immersive digital worlds become the primary way that we live our lives and spend our time."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "I think that that's a reasonable construct."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "And from that perspective, I think you also just wanna look at this as a continuation because it's not like, okay, we are building digital worlds, but we don't have that today."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I think you and I probably already live a very large part of our life in digital worlds."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "They're just not 3D immersive virtual reality, but I do a lot of meetings over video or I spend a lot of time writing things over email or WhatsApp or whatever."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "So what is it gonna take to get there for kind of the immersive presence version of this, which I think is what you're asking."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And for that, I think that there's just a bunch of different use cases."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And I think when you're building technology, I think a lot of it is just you're managing this duality where on the one hand, you wanna build these elegant things that can scale and have billions of people use them and get value from them."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And then on the other hand, you're fighting this kind of ground game where there are just a lot of different use cases and people do different things and you wanna be able to unlock them."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So the first ones that we basically went after were gaming with Quest and social experiences."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And it goes back to when we started working on virtual reality."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "My theory at the time was basically people thought about it as gaming, but if you look at all computing platforms up to that point, gaming is a huge part, it was a huge part of PCs, it was a huge part of mobile, but it was also very decentralized."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "There wasn't, for the most part, one or two gaming companies."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "There were a lot of gaming companies and gaming is somewhat hits based."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "I mean, we're getting some games that have more longevity, but in general, there were a lot of different games out there."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "But on PC and on mobile, the companies that focused on communication and social interaction, there tended to be a smaller number of those and that ended up being just as important of a thing as all of the games that you did combined."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "I think productivity is another area."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "That's obviously something that we've historically been less focused on, but I think it's gonna be really important for us."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "With workroom, do you mean productivity in the collaborative aspect?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Yeah, I think that there's a workroom's aspect of this, like a meeting aspect, and then I think that there's like a Word, Excel, productivity, either you're working or coding or knowledge work as opposed to just meetings."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "So you can kind of go through all these different use cases."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Gaming, I think we're well on our way."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Social, I think we're just the kind of preeminent company that focuses on this."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "And I think that that's already on Quest becoming the, if you look at the list of what are the top apps, social apps are already number one, two, three."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So that's kind of becoming a critical thing, but I don't know."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "I would imagine for someone like you, it'll be until we get a lot of the work things dialed in."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "When this is just like much more adopted and clearly better than Zoom for VC, when if you're doing your coding or your writing or whatever it is in VR, which it's not that far off to imagine that because pretty soon you're just gonna be able to have a screen that's bigger than, it'll be your ideal setup and you can bring it with you and put it on anywhere and have your kind of ideal workstation."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So I think that there are a few things to work out on that, but I don't think that that's more than five years off."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then you'll get a bunch of other things that like aren't even possible or you don't even think about using a phone or PC for today, like fitness, right?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So, I mean, I know you're, we were talking before about how you're into running and like I'm really into a lot of things around fitness as well, different things in different places."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "I got really into hydrofoiling recently and surfing and I used to fence competitively."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I like run."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So, and you were saying that you were thinking about trying different martial arts and I tried to trick you and convince you into doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Or you actually mentioned that that was one you're curious about and I don't know."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Is that a trick?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "We're in the metaverse now."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Yeah, no, I took that seriously."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "I thought that that was a real suggestion."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "That would be an amazing chance if we ever step on the mat together and just like roll around."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "I'll show you some moves."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Well, give me a year to train and then we can do it."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "You know, you've seen Rocky IV where the Russian faces off the American."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "I'm the Russian in this picture."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And then you're the Rocky, the underdog that gets to win in the end."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "The idea of me as Rocky and like fighting is..."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "If he dies, he dies."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Sorry, I just had to."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "But I mean, a lot of aspects of fitness."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "You know, I don't know if you've tried supernatural on Quest or..."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So first of all, can I just comment on the fact every time I played around with Quest 2, I just, I get giddy every time I step into virtual reality."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So you mentioned productivity and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "That's definitely something I'm excited about, but really I just love the possibilities of stepping into that world."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Maybe it's the introvert in me, but it just feels like the most convenient way to travel into worlds, into worlds that are similar to the real world or totally different."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "It's like Alice in Wonderland."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Just try out crazy stuff."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "The possibilities are endless."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And I just, I personally am just love, get excited for stepping in those virtual worlds."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "So I'm a huge fan."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "In terms of the productivity as a programmer, I spend most of my day programming."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "That's really interesting also, but then you have to develop the right IDEs."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "You have to develop, like there has to be a threshold where a large amount of the programming community moves there, but the collaborative aspects that are possible in terms of meetings, in terms of when two coders are working together, I mean, the possibilities there are super, super exciting."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I think that in building this, we sort of need to balance."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "There are gonna be some new things that you just couldn't do before."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And those are gonna be the amazing experiences."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "So teleporting to any place, right?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Whether it's a real place or something that people made."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And I mean, some of the experiences around how we can build stuff in new ways, where a lot of the stuff that, when I'm coding stuff, it's like, all right, you code it and then you build it and then you see it afterwards."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But increasingly it's gonna be possible to, you're in a world and you're building the world as you are in it and kind of manipulating it."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "One of the things that we showed at our Inside the Lab for recent artificial intelligence progress is this Builder Bot program, where now you can just talk to it and say, hey, okay, I'm in this world, like put some trees over there and it'll do that."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And like, all right, put some bottles of water on our picnic blanket and it'll do that and you're in the world."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "And I think there are gonna be new paradigms for coding."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So yeah, there are gonna be some things that I think are just pretty amazing, especially the first few times that you do them, but that you're like, whoa, like I've never had an experience like this."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "But most of your life, I would imagine, is not doing things that are amazing for the first time."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "A lot of this in terms of, I mean, just answering your question from before around, what is it gonna take before you're spending most of your time in this?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Well, first of all, let me just say it as an aside, the goal isn't to have people spend a lot more time in computing."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "It's to make it so that."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I'm asking for myself."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Yeah, it's to make it."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "When will I spend all my time in?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Yeah, it's to make computing more natural."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "But I think you will spend most of your computing time in this when it does the things that you use computing for somewhat better."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "So maybe having your perfect workstation is a 5% improvement on your coding productivity."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Maybe it's not like a completely new thing."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "But I mean, look, if I could increase the productivity of every engineer at Meta by 5%, we'd buy those devices for everyone."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And I imagine a lot of other companies would too."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And that's how you start getting to the scale that I think makes this rival some of the bigger computing platforms that exist today."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Let me ask you about identity."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "We talked about the avatar."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "How do you see identity in the Metaverse?"}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Should the avatar be tied to your identity or can I be anything in the Metaverse?"}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Like, can I be whatever the heck I want?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Can I even be a troll?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So there's exciting freeing possibilities and there's the darker possibilities too."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think that there's gonna be a range, right?"}, {"time": 1563, "text": "So we're working on, for expression and avatars, on one end of the spectrum are kind of expressive and cartoonish avatars."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And then on the other end of the spectrum are photorealistic avatars."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And I just think the reality is that there are gonna be different use cases for different things."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And I guess there's another axis."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So if you're going from photorealistic to expressive, there's also like representing you directly versus like some fantasy identity."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And I think that there are gonna be things on all ends of that spectrum too, right?"}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So you'll want photo, like in some experience, you might wanna be like a photorealistic dragon, right?"}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Or if I'm playing Onward, or just this military simulator game, I think getting to be more photorealistic as a soldier in that could enhance the experience."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "There are times when I'm hanging out with friends where I want them to know it's me."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So a kind of cartoonish or expressive version of me is good."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But there are also experiences like, VRChat does this well today, where a lot of the experience is kind of dressing up and wearing a fantastical avatar that's almost like a meme or is humorous."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So you come into an experience and it's almost like you have like a built in icebreaker because like you see people and you're just like, all right, I'm cracking up at what you're wearing because that's funny."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "And it's just like, where'd you get that?"}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Or, oh, you made that?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "That's, it's awesome."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "Whereas, okay, if you're going into a work meeting, maybe a photorealistic version of your real self is gonna be the most appropriate thing for that."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So I think the reality is there aren't going to be, it's not just gonna be one thing."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "You know, my own sense of kind of how you wanna express identity online has sort of evolved over time."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And that, you know, early days in Facebook, I thought, okay, people are gonna have one identity."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And now I think that's clearly not gonna be the case."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I think you're gonna have all these different things and there's utility in being able to do different things."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So some of the technical challenges that I'm really interested in around it are how do you build the software to allow people to seamlessly go between them?"}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So say, so you could view them as just completely discrete points on a spectrum, but let's talk about the metaverse economy for a second."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Let's say I buy a digital shirt for my photorealistic avatar, which by the way, I think at the time where we're spending a lot of time in the metaverse doing a lot of our work meetings in the metaverse and et cetera, I would imagine that the economy around virtual clothing as an example is going to be quite as big."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Why wouldn't I spend almost as much money in investing in my appearance or expression for my photorealistic avatar for meetings as I would for whatever I'm gonna wear in my video chat."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "But the question is, okay, so you, let's say you buy some shirt for your photorealistic avatar."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to basically translate that into a more expressive thing for your kind of cartoonish or expressive avatar?"}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And there are multiple ways to do that."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "You can view them as two discrete points and okay, maybe if a designer sells one thing, then it actually comes in a pack and there's two and you can use either one on that, but I actually think this stuff might exist more as a spectrum in the future."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "And that's what I do think the direction on some of the AI advances that is happening to be able to, especially stuff around like style transfer, being able to take a piece of art or express something and say, okay, paint me this photo in the style of Gauguin or whoever it is that you're interested in."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Take this shirt and put it in the style of what I've designed for my expressive avatar."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "I think that's gonna be pretty compelling."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "And so the fashion, you might be buying like a generator, like a closet that generates a style."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And then like with the GANs, you'll be able to infinitely generate outfits thereby making it, so the reason I wear the same thing all the time is I don't like choice."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "You've talked about the same thing, but now you don't even have to choose."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Your closet generates your outfit for you every time."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So you have to live with the outfit it generates."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I mean, you could do that, although, no, I think that that's, I think some people will, but I think like, I think there's going to be a huge aspect of just people doing creative commerce here."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "So I think that there is going to be a big market around people designing digital clothing."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "But the question is, if you're designing digital clothing, do you need to design, if you're the designer, do you need to make it for each kind of specific discrete point along a spectrum, or are you just designing it for kind of a photo realistic case or an expressive case, or can you design one and have it translate across these things?"}, {"time": 1857, "text": "If I buy a style from a designer who I care about, and now I'm a dragon, is there a way to morph that so it goes on the dragon in a way that makes sense?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "And that I think is an interesting AI problem because you're probably not going to make it so that designers have to go design for all those things."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "But the more useful the digital content is that you buy in a lot of uses, in a lot of use cases, the more that economy will just explode."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And that's a lot of what all of the, we were joking about NFTs before, but I think a lot of the promise here is that if the digital goods that you buy are not just tied to one platform or one use case, they end up being more valuable, which means that people are more willing and more likely to invest in them, and that just spurs the whole economy."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "But the question is, that's a fascinating positive aspect, but the potential negative aspect is that you can have people concealing their identity in order to troll or even not people, bots."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So how do you know in the metaverse that you're talking to a real human or an AI or a well intentioned human?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Is that something you think about, something you're concerned about?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Well, let's break that down into a few different cases."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "I mean, because knowing that you're talking to someone who has good intentions is something that I think is not even solved in pretty much anywhere."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "But I mean, if you're talking to someone who's a dragon, I think it's pretty clear that they're not representing themselves as a person."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I think probably the most pernicious thing that you want to solve for is, I think probably one of the scariest ones is how do you make sure that someone isn't impersonating you?"}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So, okay, you're in a future version of this conversation, and we have photorealistic avatars, and we're doing this in work rooms or whatever the future version of that is, and someone walks in who looks like me."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "How do you know that that's me?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "And one of the things that we're thinking about is it's still a pretty big AI project to be able to generate photorealistic avatars that basically can like, they work like these codecs of you, right?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So you kind of have a map from your headset and whatever sensors of what your body's actually doing, and it takes the model and it kind of displays it in VR."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "But there's a question, which is, should there be some sort of biometric security so that when I put on my VR headset or I'm going to go use that avatar, I need to first prove that I am that?"}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And I think you probably are gonna want something like that."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So as we're developing these technologies, we're also thinking about the security for things like that because people aren't gonna wanna be impersonated."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "That's a huge security issue."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Then you just get the question of people hiding behind fake accounts to do malicious things, which is not gonna be unique to the metaverse, although certainly in a environment where it's more immersive and you have more of a sense of presence, it could be more painful."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "But this is obviously something that we've just dealt with for years in social media and the internet more broadly."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "And there, I think there have been a bunch of tactics that I think we've just evolved to, we've built up these different AI systems to basically get a sense of, is this account behaving in the way that a person would?"}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And it turns out, so in all of the work that we've done around, we call it community integrity and it's basically like policing harmful content and trying to figure out where to draw the line."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And there are all these like really hard and philosophical questions around like, where do you draw the line on some of this stuff?"}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And the thing that I've kind of found the most effective is as much as possible trying to figure out who are the inauthentic accounts or where are the accounts that are behaving in an overall harmful way at the account level, rather than trying to get into like policing what they're saying, right?"}, {"time": 2101, "text": "Which I think the metaverse is gonna be even harder because the metaverse I think will have more properties of, it's almost more like a phone call, right?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Or it's not like I post a piece of content and is that piece of content good or bad?"}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So I think more of this stuff will have to be done at the level of the account."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "But this is the area where, between the kind of counter intelligence teams that we built up inside the company and like years of building just different AI systems to basically detect what is a real account and what isn't."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "I'm not saying we're perfect, but like this is an area where I just think we are like years ahead of basically anyone else in the industry in terms of having built those capabilities."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "And I think that that just is gonna be incredibly important for this next wave of things."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And like you said, on a technical level, on a philosophical level, it's an incredibly difficult problem to solve."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "By the way, I would probably like to open source my avatar so there could be like millions of Lexis walking around just like an army."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Like Agent Smith?"}, {"time": 2168, "text": "Agent Smith, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So the Unity ML folks built a copy of me and they sent it to me."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "So there's a person running around and I've just been doing reinforcement learning on it."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "I was gonna release it because just to have sort of like thousands of Lexis doing reinforcement."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "So they fall over naturally, they have to learn how to like walk around and stuff."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "So I love that idea, this tension between biometric security, you want to have one identity, but then certain avatars, you might have to have many."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "I don't know which is better security, sort of flooding the world with Lexis and thereby achieving security or really being protective of your identity."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "I have to ask you a security question actually."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "Well, how does flooding the world with Lexis help me know in our conversation that I'm talking to the real Lex?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "I completely destroy the trust in all my relationships then, right?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "If I flood, cause then it's, yeah, that."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "I think that one's not gonna work that well for you."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "It's not gonna work that well for the original copy."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "It probably fits some things."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Like if you're a public figure and you're trying to have a bunch of, if you're trying to show up in a bunch of different places in the future, you'll be able to do that in the metaverse."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So that kind of replication I think will be useful."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But I do think that you're gonna want a notion of like, I am talking to the real one."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Yeah, especially if the fake ones start outperforming you and all your private relationships and then you're left behind."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "I mean, that's a serious concern I have with clones."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "Again, the things I think about."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "Okay, so I recently got, I use QNAP NAS storage."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "So just storage for video and stuff."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And I recently got hacked."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "This is the first time for me with ransomware."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "It's not me personally, it's all QNAP devices."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "So the question that people have is about security in general."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Because I was doing a lot of the right things in terms of security and nevertheless, ransomware basically disabled my device."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "What are the different steps you could take to protect people's data on the security front?"}, {"time": 2296, "text": "I think that there's different solutions for, and strategies where it makes sense to have stuff kind of put behind a fortress, right?"}, {"time": 2305, "text": "So the centralized model versus the decentralizing."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "Then I think both have strengths and weaknesses."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So I think anyone who says, okay, just decentralize everything, that'll make it more secure."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "I think that that's tough because, I mean, the advantage of something like encryption is that we run the largest encrypted service in the world with WhatsApp."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And we're one of the first to roll out a multi platform encryption service."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And that's something that I think was a big advance for the industry."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And one of the promises that we can basically make because of that, our company doesn't see when you're sending an encrypted message and to an encrypted message, what the content is of what you're sharing."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "So that way, if someone hacks Meta servers, they're not gonna be able to access the WhatsApp message that you're sending to your friend."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "And that I think matters a lot to people because obviously if someone is able to compromise a company's servers and that company has hundreds of millions or billions of people, then that ends up being a very big deal."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "The flip side of that is, okay, all the content is on your phone."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "Are you following security best practices on your phone?"}, {"time": 2375, "text": "If you lose your phone, all your content is gone."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "Maybe you go back up your content from WhatsApp or some other service in an iCloud or something, but then you're just at Apple's whims about, are they gonna go turn over the data to some government or are they gonna get hacked?"}, {"time": 2393, "text": "So a lot of the time it is useful to have data in a centralized place too because then you can train systems that can just do much better personalization."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I think that in a lot of cases, centralized systems can offer, especially if you're a serious company, you're running the state of the art stuff and you have red teams attacking your own stuff and you're putting out bounty programs and trying to attract some of the best hackers in the world to go break into your stuff all the time."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "So I think you want to adopt that approach as a company and just constantly be hardening yourself."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Trying to stay one step ahead of the attackers."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "It's an inherently adversarial space."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "I think it's an interesting security is interesting because of the different kind of threats that we've managed over the last five years, there are ones where basically the adversaries keep on getting better and better."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So trying to kind of interfere with security is certainly one area of this."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "If you have nation states that are trying to interfere in elections or something, they're kind of evolving their tactics."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Whereas on the other hand, I don't want to be too simplistic about it, but if someone is saying something hateful, people usually aren't getting smarter and smarter about how they say hateful things."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "So maybe there's some element of that, but it's a very small dynamic compared to how advanced attackers and some of these other places get over time."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "I believe most people are good, so they actually get better over time and not being less hateful because they realize it's not fun being hateful."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "That's at least the belief I have."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "But first, bathroom break."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Sure, okay."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "So we'll come back to AI, but let me ask some difficult questions now."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Social Dilemma is a popular documentary that raised concerns about the effects of social media on society."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "You responded with a point by point rebuttal titled, What the Social Dilemma Gets Wrong."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "People should read that."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "I would say the key point they make is because social media is funded by ads, algorithms want to maximize attention and engagement and an effective way to do so is to get people angry at each other, increase division and so on."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "Can you steel man their criticisms and arguments that they make in the documentary as a way to understand the concern and as a way to respond to it?"}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Well, yeah, I think that's a good conversation to have."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I don't happen to agree with the conclusions and I think that they make a few assumptions that are just very big jumps that I don't think are reasonable to make."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "But I understand overall why people would be concerned that our business model and ads in general, we do make more money as people use the service more in general, right?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "So as a kind of basic assumption, okay, do we have an incentive for people to build a service that people use more?"}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Yes, on a lot of levels."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "I mean, we think what we're doing is good."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So we think that if people are finding it useful, they'll use it more."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "Or if you just look at it as this sort of, if the only thing we cared about is money, which is not for anyone who knows me, but okay, we're a company."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "So let's say you just kind of simplified it down to that, then would we want people to use the services more?"}, {"time": 2633, "text": "Yes, and then you get to the second question, which is does kind of getting people agitated make them more likely to use the services more?"}, {"time": 2647, "text": "And I think from looking at other media in the world, especially TV, and there's the old news adage, if it bleeds, it leads."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Like I think that this is, there are a bunch of reasons why someone might think that that kind of provocative content would be the most engaging."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "Now, what I've always found is two things."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "One is that what grabs someone's attention in the near term is not necessarily something that they're going to appreciate having seen or going to be the best over the long term."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "So I think what a lot of people get wrong is that I'm not building this company to make the most money or get people to spend the most time on this in the next quarter or the next year."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "I've been doing this for 17 years at this point, and I'm still relatively young, and I have a lot more that I wanna do over the coming decades."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "So I think that it's too simplistic to say, hey, this might increase time in the near term, therefore, it's what you're gonna do."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "Because I actually think a deeper look at kind of what my incentives are, the incentives of a company that are focused on the long term, is to basically do what people are gonna find valuable over time, not what is gonna draw people's attention today."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "The other thing that I'd say is that, I think a lot of times people look at this from the perspective of media or kind of information or civic discourse, but one other way of looking at this is just that, okay, I'm a product designer, right?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Our company, we build products, and a big part of building a product is not just the function and utility of what you're delivering, but the feeling of how it feels, right?"}, {"time": 2752, "text": "And we spend a lot of time talking about virtual reality and how the kind of key aspect of that experience is the feeling of presence, which it's a visceral thing."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "It's not just about the utility that you're delivering, it's about like the sensation."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And similarly, I care a lot about how people feel when they use our products, and I don't want to build products that make people angry."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I mean, that's like not, I think, what we're here on this earth to do, is to build something that people spend a bunch of time doing and it just kind of makes them angrier at other people."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "I mean, I think that that's not good."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "That's not what I think would be sort of a good use of our time or a good contribution to the world."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So, okay, it's like people, they tell us on a per content basis, does this thing, do I like it?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "Do I love it?"}, {"time": 2800, "text": "Does it make me angry?"}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Does it make me sad?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And based on that, we choose to basically show content that makes people angry less, because of course, if you're designing a product and you want people to be able to connect and feel good over a long period of time, then that's naturally what you're gonna do."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "So, I don't know, I think overall, I understand at a high level, if you're not thinking too deeply about it, why that argument might be appealing."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "But I just think if you actually look at what our real incentives are, not just like if we were trying to optimize for the next week, but like as people working on this, like why are we here?"}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And I think it's pretty clear that that's not actually how you would wanna design the system."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "I guess one other thing that I'd say is that, while we're focused on the ads business model, I do think it's important to note that a lot of these issues are not unique to ads."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "I mean, so take like a subscription news business model, for example, I think that has just as many potential pitfalls."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Maybe if someone's paying for a subscription, you don't get paid per piece of content that they look at, but say for example, I think like a bunch of the partisanship that we see could potentially be made worse by you have these kind of partisan news organizations that basically sell subscriptions and they're only gonna get people on one side to basically subscribe to them."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "So their incentive is not to print content or produce content that's kind of centrist or down the line either."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "I bet that what a lot of them find is that if they produce stuff that's kind of more polarizing or more partisan, then that is what gets the more subscribers."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So I think that this stuff is all, there's no perfect business model."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Everything has pitfalls."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "The thing that I think is great about advertising is it makes it so the consumer service is free, which if you believe that everyone should have a voice and everyone should be able to connect, then that's a great thing, as opposed to building a luxury service that not everyone can afford."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "But look, every business model, you have to be careful about how you're implementing what you're doing."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "You responded to a few things there."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "You spoke to the fact that there is a narrative of malevolence, like you're leaning into them, making people angry just because it makes more money in the short term, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So you responded to that."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "But there's also kind of reality of human nature."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "Just like you spoke about, there's fights, arguments we get in and we don't like ourselves afterwards, but we got into them anyway."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So our longterm growth is, I believe for most of us, has to do with learning, challenging yourself, improving, being kind to each other, finding a community of people that you connect with on a real human level, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "But it does seem when you look at social media that a lot of fights break out, a lot of arguments break out, a lot of viral content ends up being sort of outrage in one direction or the other."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "And so it's easy from that to infer the narrative that social media companies are letting this outrage become viral."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And so they're increasing the division in the world."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "I mean, perhaps you can comment on that or further, how can you be, how can you push back on this narrative?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "How can you be transparent about this battle?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Because I think it's not just motivation or financials, it's a technical problem too, which is how do you improve longterm wellbeing of human beings?"}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I think that going through some of the design decisions would be a good conversation."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "But first, I actually think, I think you acknowledged that, that narrative is somewhat anecdotal."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And I think it's worth grounding this conversation in the actual research that has been done on this, which by and large finds that social media is not a large driver of polarization, right?"}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And, I mean, there's been a number of economists and social scientists and folks who have studied this."}, {"time": 3078, "text": "In a lot of polarization, it varies around the world."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "If social media is basically in every country, Facebook's in pretty much every country except for China and maybe North Korea."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And you see different trends in different places where in a lot of countries polarization is declining, in some it's flat, in the US it's risen sharply."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "So the question is, what are the unique phenomenon in the different places?"}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And I think for the people who are trying to say, hey, social media is the thing that's doing this."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I think that that clearly doesn't hold up because social media is a phenomenon that is pretty much equivalent in all of these different countries."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And you have researchers like this economist at Stanford, Matthew Genskow, who has just written at length about this."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "And it's a bunch of books by political scientists, Ezra Klein and folks, why we're polarized, basically goes through this decades long analysis in the US."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "Before I was born, basically talking about some of the forces in kind of partisan politics and Fox News and different things that predate the internet in a lot of ways that I think are likely larger contributors."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "So to the contrary on this, not only is it pretty clear that social media is not a major contributor, but most of the academic studies that I've seen actually show that social media use is correlated with lower polarization."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And Genskow, the same person who just did the study that I cited about longitudinal polarization across different countries, also did a study that basically showed that if you looked after the 2016 election in the US, the voters who were the most polarized were actually the ones who were not on the internet."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "So, and there have been recent other studies, I think in Europe and around the world, basically showing that as people stop using social media, they tend to get more polarized."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Then there's a deeper analysis around, okay, well, polarization actually isn't even one thing."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Cause you know, having different opinions on something isn't, I don't think that that's by itself bad."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "What people who study this say is most problematic is what they call affective polarization, which is basically are you, do you have negative feelings towards people of another group?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "And the way that a lot of scholars study this is they basically ask a group, would you let your kids marry someone of group X?"}, {"time": 3230, "text": "Whatever the groups are that you're worried that someone might have negative feelings towards."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And in general, use of social media has corresponded to decreases in that kind of affective polarization."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "So I just wanna, I think we should talk through the design decisions and how we handle the kind of specific pieces of content, but overall, I think it's just worth grounding that discussion in the research that's existed that I think overwhelmingly shows that the mainstream narrative around this is just not right."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But the narrative does take hold and it's compelling to a lot of people."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "There's another question I'd like to ask you on this."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "I was looking at various polls and saw that you're one of the most disliked tech leaders today, 54% unfavorable rating."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "Elon Musk is 23%."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "It's basically everybody has a very high unfavorable rating that are tech leaders."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "Maybe you can help me understand that."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "Why do you think so many people dislike you?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Some even hate you."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "And how do you regain their trust and support?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "Given everything you just said, why are you losing the battle in explaining to people what actual impact social media has on society?"}, {"time": 3312, "text": "Well, I'm curious if that's a US survey or world."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "It is US, yeah."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "So I think that there's a few dynamics."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "One is that our brand has been somewhat uniquely challenged in the US compared to other places."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "It's not that there are."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "I mean, other countries, we have issues too, but I think in the US, there was this dynamic where if you look at like the next sentiment of kind of coverage or attitude towards us, before 2016, I think that there were probably very few months, if any, where it was negative."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And since 2016, I think that there probably been very few months, if any, then it's been positive."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "But I think it's a specific thing."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And this is very different from other places."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So I think in a lot of other countries in the world, the sentiment towards meta and our services is extremely positive."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "In the US, we have more challenges."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "And I think compared to other companies, you can look at certain industries, I think if you look at it from like a partisan perspective, not from like a political perspective, but just kind of culturally, it's like there are people who are probably more left of center and there are people who are more right of center, and there's kind of blue America and red America."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "There are certain industries that I think maybe one half of the country has a more positive view towards than another."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "The net effect of that is that we're kind of constantly making decisions that piss off people in both camps."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "They're just like, ah, you didn't mess that one up."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "But their opinion doesn't tend to go up by that much."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "Whereas the people who kind of are on the other side of it are like, God, how could you mess that up?"}, {"time": 3475, "text": "How could you possibly think that that piece of content is okay and should be up and should not be censored?"}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Or, and so I think the, whereas if you leave it up and, you know, it's, or if you take it down, the people who thought it should be taken down or, you know, it's like, all right, fine, great."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "You didn't mess that one up."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So our internal assessment of, and the kind of analytics on our brand are basically anytime one of these big controversial things comes up in society, our brand goes down with half of the country."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "And then like, if you, and then if you just kind of extrapolate that out, it's just been very challenging for us to try to navigate what is a polarizing country in a principled way, where we're not trying to kind of hew to one side or the other, we're trying to do what we think is the right thing."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "But that's what I think is the right thing for us to do though."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "So, I mean, that's what we'll try to keep doing."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Just as a human being, how does it feel though, when you're giving so much of your day to day life to try to heal division, to try to do good in the world, as we've talked about, that so many people in the US, the place you call home have a negative view of you as a leader, as a human being and the company you love?"}, {"time": 3554, "text": "Well, I mean, it's not great, but I mean, look, if I wanted people to think positively about me as a person, I don't know, I'm not sure if you go build a company."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "I mean, it's like."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Or a social media company."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "It seems exceptionally difficult to do with a social media company."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, I don't know, there is a dynamic where a lot of the other people running these companies, internet companies, have sort of stepped back and they just do things that are sort of, I don't know, less controversial."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "And some of it may be that they just get tired over time."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "But, you know, it's, so I don't know."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "I think that, you know, running a company is hard, building something at scale is hard."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "You only really do it for a long period of time if you really care about what you're doing."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And yeah, so, I mean, it's not great, but like, but look, I think that at some level, whether 25% of people dislike you or 75% of people dislike you, your experience as a public figure is gonna be that there's a lot of people who dislike you, right?"}, {"time": 3623, "text": "So, I actually am not sure how different it is."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "You know, certainly, you know, the country's gotten more polarized and we in particular have gotten, you know, more controversial over the last five or years or so."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "But, I don't know, I kind of think like as a public figure and leader of one of these enterprises."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Comes with the job."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "Yeah, part of what you do is like, and look, the answer can't just be ignore it, right?"}, {"time": 3654, "text": "Because like a huge part of the job is like you need to be getting feedback and internalizing feedback on how you can do better."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "But I think increasingly what you need to do is be able to figure out, you know, who are the kind of good faith critics who are criticizing you because they're trying to help you do a better job rather than tear you down."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "So I think that that's just kind of a dance that people have to do."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "But I mean, I, you know, so you kind of develop more of a feel for like, who actually is trying to accomplish the same types of things in the world and who has different ideas about how to do that and how can I learn from those people?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "And like, yeah, we get stuff wrong."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "And when the people whose opinions I respect call me out on getting stuff wrong, that hurts and makes me wanna do better."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "But I think at this point, I'm pretty tuned to just, all right, if someone, if I know they're, they're kind of like operating in bad faith and they're not really trying to help, then, you know, I don't know, it's not, it's, it doesn't, you know, I think over time, it just doesn't bother you that much."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "But you are surrounded by people that believe in the mission that love you."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "Are there friends or colleagues in your inner circle you trust that call you out on your bullshit whenever your thinking may be misguided as it is for leaders at times?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "I think we have a famously open company culture where we sort of encourage that kind of dissent internally, which is, you know, why there's so much material internally that can leak out with people sort of disagreeing is because that's sort of the culture."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "You know, our management team, I think it's a lot of people, you know, there are some newer folks who come in, there are some folks who've kind of been there for a while, but there's a very high level of trust."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And I would say it is a relatively confrontational group of people."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "And my friends and family, I think, will push me on this."}, {"time":

criticism and the painful experiences."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "So let me ask you another difficult question."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower, leaked the internal Instagram research into teenagers and wellbeing."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "Her claim is that Instagram is choosing profit over wellbeing of teenage girls."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So Instagram is quote, toxic for them."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "Your response titled, what our research really says about teen wellbeing and Instagram says, no, Instagram research shows that 11 of 12 wellbeing issues, teenage girls who said they struggle with those difficult issues also said that Instagram made them better rather than worse."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "Again, can you steal man and defend the point and Frances Haugen's characterization of the study and then help me understand the positive and negative effects of Instagram and Facebook on young people?"}, {"time": 3920, "text":

right?"}, {"time": 3940, "text": "Which is why we dedicate teams to studying them."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "I don't think the internet or social media are unique in having these questions."},

3961, "text": "So we wanted to study it."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "And of course, we didn't expect that everything was gonna be positive all the time."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So, I mean, the reason why you study this stuff is to try to improve and get better."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So, I mean, look, the place where I disagree with the characterization first, I thought some of the reporting and coverage of it just took the whole thing out of proportion and that it focused on, as you said, I think there were like 20 metrics in there and on 18 or 19, the effect of using Instagram was neutral or positive on the teen's wellbeing."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "And there was one area where I think it showed that we needed to improve and we took some steps to try to do that after doing the research."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "But I think having the coverage just focus on that one without focusing on the, I mean, I think an accurate characterization would have been that kids using Instagram or not kids, teens is generally positive for their mental health."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "But of course, that was not the narrative that came out."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "So I think it's hard to, that's not a kind of logical thing to straw man, but I sort of disagree or steel man, but I sort of disagree with that overall characterization."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "I think anyone sort of looking at this objectively would, but then, I mean, there is this sort of intent critique that I think you were getting at before, which says, it assumes some sort of malevolence, right?"}, {"time": 4039, "text": "It's like, which it's really hard for me to really wrap my head around this because as far as I know, it's not clear that any of the other tech companies are doing this kind of research."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "So why the narrative should form that we did research because we were studying an issue because we wanted to understand it to improve and took steps after that to try to improve it, that your interpretation of that would be that we did the research and tried to sweep it under the rug."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "It just, it sort of is like, I don't know, it's beyond credibility to me that like that's the accurate description of the actions that we've taken compared to the others in the industry."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "So I don't know, that's kind of, that's my view on it."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "These are really important issues and there's a lot of stuff that I think we're gonna be working on related to teen mental health for a long time, including trying to understand this better."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "And I would encourage everyone else in the industry to do this too."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Yeah, I would love there to be open conversations and a lot of great research being released internally and then also externally."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "It doesn't make me feel good to see press obviously get way more clicks when they say negative things about social media."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "Objectively speaking, I can just tell that there's hunger to say negative things about social media."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "And I don't understand how that's supposed to lead to an open conversation about the positives and the negatives, the concerns about social media, especially when you're doing that kind of research."}, {"time": 4139, "text": "I mean, I don't know what to do with that, but let me ask you as a father, there's a weight heavy on you that people get bullied on social networks."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "So people get bullied in their private life."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "But now because so much of our life is in the digital world, the bullying moves from the physical world to the digital world."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "So you're now creating a platform on which bullying happens."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And some of that bullying can lead to damage to mental health."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And some of that bullying can lead to depression, even suicide."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "There's a weight heavy on you that people have committed suicide or will commit suicide based on the bullying that happens on social media."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a set of harms that we basically track and build systems to fight against."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And bullying and self harm are, these are some of the biggest things that we are most focused on."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "For bullying, like you say, it's gonna be, while this predates the internet, then it's probably impossible to get rid of all of it."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "You wanna give people tools to fight it and you wanna fight it yourself."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And you also wanna make sure that people have the tools to get help when they need it."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So I think this isn't like a question of, can you get rid of all bullying?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "I mean, it's like, all right, I mean, I have two daughters and they fight and push each other around and stuff too."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "And the question is just, how do you handle that situation?"}, {"time": 4247, "text": "And there's a handful of things that I think you can do."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "We talked a little bit before around some of the AI tools that you can build to identify when something harmful is happening."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "It's actually, it's very hard in bullying because a lot of bullying is very context specific."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "It's not like you're trying to fit a formula of like, if like looking at the different harms, someone promoting a terrorist group is like, probably one of the simpler things to generally find because things promoting that group are gonna look at a certain way or feel a certain way."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "Bullying could just be, you know, someone making some subtle comment about someone's appearance that's idiosyncratic to them."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "And it could look at just like humor."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "So humor to one person can be destructive to another human being, yeah."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "So with bullying, I think there are certain things that you can find through AI systems, but I think it is increasingly important to just give people more agency themselves."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "So we've done things like making it so people can turn off comments or take a break from hearing from a specific person without having to signal at all that they're gonna stop following them or kind of make some stand that, okay, I'm not friends with you anymore."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "I'm not following you."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "I just like, I just don't wanna hear about this, but I also don't wanna signal at all publicly that or to them that there's been an issue."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And then you get to some of the more extreme cases like you're talking about where someone is thinking about self harm or suicide."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And there we've found that that is a place where AI can identify a lot as well as people flagging things."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "If people are expressing something that is potentially they're thinking of hurting themselves, those are cues that you can build systems and hundreds of languages around the world to be able to identify that."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "We're rolling that out in more places around the world."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "And I think the team that worked on that just did awesome stuff."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "So I think that that's a long way of saying, yeah, I mean, this is a heavy topic and you want to attack it in a bunch of different ways and also kind of understand that some of nature is for people to do this to each other, which is unfortunate, but you can give people tools and build things that help."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "It's still one hell of a burden though."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "A platform that allows people to fall in love with each other is also by nature going to be a platform that allows people to hurt each other."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "And when you're managing such a platform, it's difficult."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "And I think you spoke to it, but the psychology of that, of being a leader in that space, of creating technology that's playing in this space, like you mentioned, psychology is really damn difficult."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "And I mean, the burden of that is just great."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "I just wanted to hear you speak to that point."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "I have to ask about the thing you've brought up a few times, which is making controversial decisions."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "Let's talk about free speech and censorship."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So there are two groups of people pressuring Meta on this."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "One group is upset that Facebook, the social network, allows misinformation in quotes to be spread on the platform."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "The other group are concerned that Facebook censors speech by calling it misinformation."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "So you're getting it from both sides."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "You, in 2019, October at Georgetown University, eloquently defended the importance of free speech, but then COVID came and the 2020 election came."}, {"time": 4504, "text": "Do you worry that outside pressures from advertisers, politicians, the public, have forced Meta to damage the ideal of free speech that you spoke highly of?"}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Just to say some obvious things upfront, I don't think pressure from advertisers or politicians directly in any way affects how we think about this."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "I think these are just hard topics."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "So let me just take you through our evolution from kind of the beginning of the company to where we are now."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "You don't build a company like this unless you believe that people expressing themselves is a good thing, right?"}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So that's sort of the foundational thing."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "You can kind of think about our company as a formula where we think giving people voice and helping people connect creates opportunity, right?"}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So those are the two things that we're always focused on are sort of helping people connect."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "We talked about that a lot, but also giving people voice and ability to express themselves."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "Then by the way, most of the time when people express themselves, that's not like politically controversial content."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "It's like expressing something about their identity that's more related to the avatar conversation we had earlier in terms of expressing some facet, but that's what's important to people on a day to day basis."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And sometimes when people feel strongly enough about something, it kind of becomes a political topic."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "That's sort of always been a thing that we've focused on."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "There's always been the question of safety in this, which if you're building a community, I think you have to focus on safety."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "We've had these community standards from early on, and there are about 20 different kinds of harm that we track and try to fight actively."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "We've talked about some of them already."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "So it includes things like bullying and harassment."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "It includes things like terrorism or promoting terrorism, inciting violence, intellectual property theft."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And in general, I think call it about 18 out of 20 of those."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "There's not really a particularly polarized definition of that."}, {"time": 4619, "text": "I think you're not really gonna find many people in the country or in the world who are trying to say we should be fighting terrorist content less."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "I think the content where there are a couple of areas where I think that this has gotten more controversial recently, which I'll talk about."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "And you're right, the misinformation is basically is up there."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And I think sometimes the definition of hate speech is up there too."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "But I think in general, most of the content that I think we're working on for safety is not actually, people don't kind of have these questions."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "So it's sort of this subset."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "But if you go back to the beginning of the company, this was sort of pre deep learning days."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "And therefore, it was me and my roommate Dustin join me."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "And if someone posted something bad, it was the AI technology did not exist yet to be able to go basically look at all the content."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "And we were a small enough outfit that no one would expect that we could review it all."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "Even if someone reported it to us, we basically did our best, right?"}, {"time": 4691, "text": "It's like someone would report it and we try to look at stuff and deal with stuff."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "And for call it the first seven or eight years of the company, we weren't that big of a company."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "For a lot of that period, we weren't even really profitable."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "The AI didn't really exist to be able to do the kind of moderation that we do today."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And then at some point in kind of the middle of the last decade, that started to flip."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "And we got to the point where we were sort of a larger and more profitable company."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "And the AI was starting to come online to be able to proactively detect some of the simpler forms of this."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "So things like pornography, you could train an image classifier to identify what a nipple was, or you can fight against terrorist content."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "You still could."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "There's actually papers on this, it's great."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "Oh, of course there are."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "Technical papers."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "Those are relatively easier things to train AI to do than for example, understand the nuances of what is inciting violence in a hundred languages around the world and not have the false positives of like, okay, are you posting about this thing that might be inciting violence because you're actually trying to denounce it?"}, {"time": 4766, "text": "In which case we probably shouldn't take that down."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "Where if you're trying to denounce something that's inciting violence in some kind of dialect in a corner of India, as opposed to, okay, actually you're posting this thing because you're trying to incite violence."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Okay, building an AI that can basically get to that level of nuance and all the languages that we serve is something that I think is only really becoming possible now, not towards the middle of the last decade."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "But there's been this evolution, and I think what happened, people sort of woke up after 2016 and a lot of people are like, okay, the country is a lot more polarized and there's a lot more stuff here than we realized."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "Why weren't these internet companies on top of this?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And I think at that point it was reasonable feedback that some of this technology had started becoming possible."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "And at that point, I really did feel like we needed to make a substantially larger investment."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "We'd already worked on this stuff a lot, on AI and on these integrity problems, but that we should basically invest, have a thousand or more engineers basically work on building these AI systems to be able to go and proactively identify the stuff across all these different areas."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "Okay, so we went and did that."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Now we've built the tools to be able to do that."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And now I think it's actually a much more complicated set of philosophical rather than technical questions, which is the exact policies, which are okay."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Now, the way that we basically hold ourselves accountable is we issue these transparency reports every quarter and the metric that we track is for each of these 20 types of harmful content."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "How much of that content are we taking down before someone even has to report it to us?"}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So how effective is our AI at doing this?"}, {"time": 4877, "text": "But that basically creates this big question, which is okay, now we need to really be careful about how proactive we set the AI and where the exact policy lines are around what we're taking down."}, {"time": 4890, "text": "It's certainly at a point now where I felt like at the beginning of that journey of building those AI systems, there was a lot of push."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "There's saying, okay, you've got to do more."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "There's clearly a lot more bad content that people aren't reporting or that you're not getting to and you need to get more effective at that."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "And I was pretty sympathetic to that."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "But then I think at some point along the way, there started to be almost equal issues on both sides of, okay, actually you're kind of taking down too much stuff, right?"}, {"time": 4922, "text": "Or some of the stuff is borderline and it wasn't really bothering anyone and they didn't report it."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "So is that really an issue that you need to take down?"}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Whereas we still have the critique on the other side too where a lot of people think we're not doing enough."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So it's become, as we built the technical capacity, I think it becomes more philosophically interesting almost where you wanna be on the line."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And I just think you don't want one person making those decisions."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "So we've also tried to innovate in terms of building out this independent oversight board, which has people who are dedicated to free expression but from around the world who people can appeal cases to."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So a lot of the most controversial cases basically go to them and they make the final binding decision on how we should handle that."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "And then of course, their decisions, we then try to figure out what the principles are behind those and encode them into the algorithms."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "And how are those people chosen, which, you know, you're outsourcing a difficult decision."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Yeah, the initial people, we chose a handful of chairs for the group and we basically chose the people for a commitment to free expression and like a broad understanding of human rights and the trade offs around free expression."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So they fundamentally people who are gonna lean towards free expression."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Towards freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "Okay, so there's also this idea of fact checkers."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "So jumping around to the misinformation questions, especially during COVID, which is an exceptionally speaking of polarization."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "Can I speak to the COVID thing?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "I mean, I think one of the hardest set of questions around free expression, because you asked about Georgetown has my stance fundamentally changed?"}, {"time": 5023, "text": "And the answer to that is no, my stance has not changed."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "It is fundamentally the same as when I was talking at Georgetown from a philosophical perspective."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "The challenge with free speech is that everyone agrees that there is a line where if you're actually about to do physical harm to people that there should be restrictions."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "So, I mean, there's the famous Supreme Court historical example of like, you can't yell fire in a crowded theater."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "The thing that everyone disagrees on is what is the definition of real harm?"}, {"time": 5062, "text": "Where I think some people think, okay, this should only be a very literal, I mean, take it back to the bullying conversation we were just having, where is it just harm if the person is about to hurt themselves because they've been bullied so hard?"}, {"time": 5076, "text": "Or is it actually harm like as they're being bullied?"}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And kind of at what point in the spectrum is that?"}, {"time": 5082, "text": "And that's the part that there's not agreement on."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "But I think what people agree on pretty broadly is that when there is an acute threat that it does make sense from a societal perspective to tolerate less speech."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "That could be potentially harmful in that acute situation."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So I think where COVID got very difficult is, I don't think anyone expected this to be going on for years."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But if you'd kind of asked now a priori, would a global pandemic where a lot of people are dying and catching this, is that an emergency that where you'd kind of consider it that it's problematic to basically yell fire in a crowded theater?"}, {"time": 5126, "text": "I think that that probably passes that test."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So I think that it's a very tricky situation, but I think the fundamental commitment to free expression is there."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And that's what I believe."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "And again, I don't think you start this company unless you care about people being able to express themselves as much as possible."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "But I think that that's the question, is how do you define what the harm is and how acute that is?"}, {"time": 5152, "text": "And what are the institutions that define that harm?"}, {"time": 5155, "text": "A lot of the criticism is that the CDC, the WHO, the institutions we've come to trust as a civilization to give the line of what is and isn't harm in terms of health policy have failed in many ways, in small ways and in big ways, depending on who you ask."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And then the perspective of meta and Facebook is like, well, where the hell do I get the information of what is and isn't misinformation?"}, {"time": 5182, "text": "So it's a really difficult place to be in, but it's great to hear that you're leaning towards freedom of speech on this aspect."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And again, I think this actually calls to the fact that we need to reform institutions that help keep an open mind of what is and isn't misinformation."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "And misinformation has been used to bully on the internet."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "I mean, I just have, I'm friends with Joe Rogan and he is called as a, I remember hanging out with him in Vegas and somebody yelled, stop spreading misinformation."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "I mean, and there's a lot of people that follow him that believe he's not spreading misinformation."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "Like you can't just not acknowledge the fact that there's a large number of people that have a different definition of misinformation."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And that's such a tough place to be."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "Like who do you listen to?"}, {"time": 5231, "text": "Do you listen to quote unquote experts who gets, as a person who has a PhD, I gotta say, I mean, I'm not sure I know what defines an expert, especially in a new, in a totally new pandemic or a new catastrophic event, especially when politics is involved and especially when the news are, the media involved that can propagate sort of outrageous narratives and thereby make a lot of money."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "Like what the hell?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "Where's the source of truth?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And then everybody turns to Facebook."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "It's like, please tell me what the source of truth is."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "Well, I mean, well, how would you handle this if you were in my position?"}, {"time": 5272, "text": "Is very, very, very, very difficult."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "I would say, I would more speak about how difficult the choices are and be transparent about like, what the hell do you do with this?"}, {"time": 5285, "text": "Like here, you got exactly, ask the exact question you just asked me, but to the broader public, like, okay, yeah, you guys tell me what to do."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So like crowdsource it."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "And then the other aspect is when you spoke really eloquently about the fact that there's this going back and forth and now there's a feeling like you're censoring a little bit too much."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "So I would lean, I would try to be ahead of that feeling."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "I would now lean towards freedom of speech and say, we're not the ones that are going to define misinformation."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "Let it be a public debate, let the idea stand."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "And I actually place, this idea of misinformation, I place the responsibility on the poor communication skills of scientists."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "They should be in the battlefield of ideas and everybody who is spreading information against the vaccine, they should not be censored."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "They should be talked with and you should show the data, you should have open discussion as opposed to rolling your eyes and saying, I'm the expert, I know what I'm talking about."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "No, you need to convince people, it's a battle of ideas."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "So that's the whole point of freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "It's the way to defeat bad ideas is with good ideas, with speech."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "So like the responsibility here falls on the poor communication skills of scientists."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "Thanks to social media, scientists are not communicators."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "They have the power to communicate."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "Some of the best stuff I've seen about COVID from doctors is on social media."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "It's a way to learn to respond really quickly, to go faster than the peer review process."}, {"time": 5383, "text": "And so they just need to get way better at that communication."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "And also by better, I don't mean just convincing, I also mean speak with humility, don't talk down to people, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And as a platform, I would say, I would step back a little bit."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "Not all the way, of course, because there's a lot of stuff that can cause real harm as we've talked about, but you lean more towards freedom of speech because then people from a brand perspective wouldn't be blaming you for the other ills of society, which there are many."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "The institutions have flaws, the political divide, obviously politicians

being asked of human civilization."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "So I don't know, maybe this is an American answer though, to lean towards freedom of speech."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "I don't know if that applies globally."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "So yeah, I don't know."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "But transparency and saying, I think as a technologist, one of the things I sense about Facebook and meta when people talk about this company is they don't necessarily understand fully how difficult the problem is."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "You talked about AI has to catch a bunch of harmful stuff really quickly."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "Just the sea of data you have to deal with."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "It's a really difficult problem."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "So like any of the critics, if you just hand them the helm for a week, let's see how well you can do."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Like that, to me, that's definitely something that would wake people up to how difficult this problem is if there's more transparency of saying how difficult this problem is."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "Let me ask you about, on the AI front, just because you mentioned language and my ineloquence."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Translation is something I wanted to ask you about."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And first, just to give a shout out to the supercomputer."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "You've recently announced the AI research supercluster, RSC."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Obviously, I'm somebody who loves the GPUs."}, {"time": 5514, "text": "It currently has 6,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "NVIDIA DGX A100 is the systems that have in total 6,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "And it will eventually, maybe this year, maybe soon, will have 16,000 GPUs."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "So it can do a bunch of different kinds of machine learning applications."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "There's a cool thing on the distributed storage aspect and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So one of the applications that I think is super exciting is translation, real time translation."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "I mentioned to you that having a conversation, I speak Russian fluently, I speak English somewhat fluently, and having a conversation with Vladimir Putin, say, as a use case."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "Me, as a user, coming to you as a use case."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "We both speak each other's language."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "I speak Russian, he speaks English."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "How can we have that communication go well with the help of AI?"}, {"time": 5569, "text": "I think it's such a beautiful and a powerful application of AI to connect the world, that bridge the gap, not necessarily between me and Putin, but people that don't have that shared language."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "Can you just speak about your vision with translation?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "Because I think that's a really exciting application."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "If you're trying to help people connect all around the world, a lot of content is produced in one language and people in all these other places are interested in it."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "So being able to translate that just unlocks a lot of value on a day to day basis."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "I mean, so the kind of AI around translation is interesting because it's gone through a bunch of iterations."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "But the basic state of the art is that you don't wanna go through different kind of intermediate symbolic representations of language or something like that."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "You basically wanna be able to map the concepts and basically go directly from one language to another."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "And you just can train bigger and bigger models in order to be able to do that."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "And that's where the research supercluster comes in is basically a lot of the trend in machine learning is just you're building bigger and bigger models and you just need a lot of computation to train them."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "So it's not that like the translation would run on the supercomputer, the training of the model, which could have billions or trillions of examples of just basically that."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "You're training models on this supercluster in days or weeks that might take a much longer period of time on a smaller cluster."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "So it just wouldn't be practical for most teams to do."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "But the translation work, we're basically getting from being able to go between about a hundred languages seamlessly today to being able to go to about 300 languages in the near term."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "So from any language to any other language."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "And part of the issue when you get closer to more languages is some of these get to be pretty, not very popular languages, right?"}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Where there isn't that much content in them."}, {"time": 5704, "text": "So you end up having less data and you need to kind of use a model that you've built up around other examples."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "And this is one of the big questions around AI is like how generalizable can things be?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "And that I think is one of the things that's just kind of exciting here from a technical perspective."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "But capturing, we talked about this with the metaverse, capturing the magic of human to human interaction."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "So me and Putin, okay."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "Again, this is therapy session."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "I mean, it's a tough example because you actually both speak Russian and English."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "No, but that's."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "But in the future."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "I see it as a touring test of a kind because we would both like to have an AI that improves because I don't speak Russian that well."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "He doesn't speak English that well."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "It would be nice to outperform our abilities and it sets a really nice bar because I think AI can really help in translation for people that don't speak the language at all, but to actually capture the magic of the chemistry, the translation, which would make the metaverse super immersive."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "I mean, that's exciting."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "You remove the barrier of language, period."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "Yeah, so when people think about translation, I think a lot of that is they're thinking about text to text, but speech to speech, I think is a whole nother thing."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And I mean, one of the big lessons on that, which I was referring to before is I think early models, it's like, all right, they take speech, they translate it to text, translate the text to another language and then kind of output that as speech in that language."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "And you don't wanna do that."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "You just wanna be able to go directly from speech in one language to speech in another language and build up the models to do that."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "And I mean, I think one of the, there have been, when you look at the progress in machine learning, there have been big advances in the techniques, some of the advances in self supervised learning, which I know you talked to Jan about and he's like one of the leading thinkers in this area."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "I just think that that stuff is really exciting, but then you couple that with the ability to just throw larger and larger amounts of compute at training these models."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And you can just do a lot of things that were harder to do before."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "But we're asking more of our systems too, right?"}, {"time": 5832, "text": "So if you think about the applications that we're gonna need for the metaverse, or think about it, okay, so let's talk about AR here for a second."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "You're gonna have these glasses, they're gonna look hopefully like a normal ish looking pair of glasses, but they're gonna be able to put holograms in the world and intermix virtual and physical objects in your scene."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "And one of the things that's gonna be unique about this compared to every other computing device that you've had before, is that this is gonna be the first computing device that has all the same signals about what's going on around you that you have."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "Right, so your phone, you can have it take a photo or a video, but I mean, these glasses are gonna, whenever you activate them, they're gonna be able to see what you see from your perspective, they're gonna be able to hear what you hear because the microphones and all that are gonna be right around where your ears are."}, {"time": 5885, "text": "So you're gonna want an AI assistant, that's a new kind of AI assistant that can basically help you process the world from this first person perspective or from the perspective that you have."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And the utility of that is gonna be huge, but the kinds of AI models that we're gonna need are going to be just, I don't know, there's a lot that we're gonna need to basically make advances in."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "But I mean, but that's why I think these concepts of the metaverse and the advances in AI are so fundamentally interlinked that I mean, they're kind of enabling each other."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "Yeah, like the world builder is a really cool idea."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "Like you can be like a Bob Ross, like I'm gonna put a little tree right here."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "I need a little tree, it's missing a little tree."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "And then, but at scale, like enriching your experience in all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "You mentioned the assistant too, that's really interesting how you can have AI assistants helping you out on different levels of sort of intimacy of communication."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "It could be just like scheduling or it could be like almost like therapy."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "Clearly I need some."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "So let me ask you, you're one of the most successful people ever."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "You've built an incredible company that has a lot of impact."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "How to live a life they can be proud of?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "How to build something that can have a big positive impact on the world?"}, {"time": 5971, "text": "Well, let's break that down."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "Cause I think you proud of, have a big positive impact."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Well, you're actually listening."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "And how to live your life are actually three different things that I think, I mean, they could line up, but, and also like what age of people are you talking to?"}, {"time": 5992, "text": "Cause I mean, I can like."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "High school and college."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "So you don't really know what you're doing, but your dream big."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "And you really have a chance to do something unprecedented."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "So I guess just to."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "Also for people my age."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "Okay, so let's maybe start with the kind of most philosophical and abstract version of this."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "Every night when I put my daughters to bed, we go through this thing and like, they call it the good night things."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "Cause we're basically what we talk about at night."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "And I just, I go through them."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "Sounds like a good show."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "The good night things."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "Priscilla's always asking, she's like, can I get good night things?"}, {"time": 6036, "text": "You go to bed too early."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "But it's, but I basically go through with Max and Augie, what are the things that are most important in life?"}, {"time": 6049, "text": "That I just, it's like, what do I want them to remember and just have like really ingrained in them as they grow up?"}, {"time": 6053, "text": "And it's health, right?"}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Making sure that you take care of yourself and keep yourself in good shape, loving friends and family, right?"}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Because having the relationships, the family and making time for friends, I think is perhaps one of the most important things."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And then the third is maybe a little more amorphous, but it is something that you're excited about for the future."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And when I'm talking to a four year old, often I'll ask her what she's excited about for tomorrow or the week ahead."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "But I think for most people, it's really hard."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "I mean, the world is a heavy place."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "And I think like the way that we navigate it is that we have things that we're looking forward to."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "So whether it is building AR glasses for the future or being able to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary with my wife that's coming up, it's like, I think people, you know, you have things that you're looking forward to."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "Or for the girls, it's often I want to see mom in the morning, right?"}, {"time": 6114, "text": "It's just, but it's like that's a really critical thing."}, {"time": 6117, "text": "And then the last thing is I ask them every day, what did you do today to help someone?"}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Because I just think that that's a really critical thing is like, it's easy to kind of get caught up in yourself and kind of stuff that's really far down the road, but like, did you do something just concrete today to help someone?"}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And, you know, it can just be as simple as, okay, yeah, I helped set the table for lunch, right?"}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Or, you know, this other kid in our school was having a hard time with something and I like helped explain it to him."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "But in that those are, that's sort of like, if you were to boil down my overall life philosophy into what I try to impart to my kids, those are the things that I think are really important."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "So, okay, so let's say college."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "So if you're a graduate in college, probably more practical advice, I'm always very focused on people."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "And I think the most important decision you're probably gonna make if you're in college is who you surround yourself with, because you become like the people you surround yourself with."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "And I sort of have this hiring heuristic at Metta, which is that I will only hire someone to work for me if I could see myself working for them."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "Not necessarily that I want them to run the company because I like my job, but in an alternate universe, if it was their company and I was looking to go work somewhere, would I be happy to work for them?"}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And I think that that's a helpful heuristic to help balance, you know, when you're building something like this, there's a lot of pressure to, you know, you wanna build out your team, because there's a lot of stuff that you need to get done."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "And everyone always says, don't compromise on quality, but there's this question of, okay, well, how do you know that someone is good enough?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "And I think my answer is, I would want someone to be on my team if I would work for them."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "But I think it's actually a pretty similar answer to like, if you were choosing friends or a partner or something like that."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "So when you're kind of in college, trying to figure out what your circle is gonna be, trying to figure out, you know, you're evaluating data, your circle is gonna be trying to figure out, you know, you're evaluating different job opportunities."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "But I don't know, I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they're basically building relationships with."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "I don't know what it says about me, but my place in Austin now has seven legged robots."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "So I'm surrounded myself by robots, which is probably something I should look into."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "What kind of world would you like to see your daughters grow up in, even after you're gone?"}, {"time": 6309, "text": "Well, I think one of the promises of all the stuff that is getting built now is that it can be a world where more people can just live out their imagination."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "One of my favorite quotes, I think it was attributed to Picasso, it's that all children are artists, and the challenge is how do you remain one when you grow up?"}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And if you have kids, this is pretty clear, I mean, they just have wonderful imaginations."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And part of what I think is gonna be great about the creator economy and the metaverse and all this stuff is this notion around that a lot more people in the future are gonna get to work doing creative stuff than what I think today we would just consider traditional labor or service."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "And I think that that's awesome."}, {"time": 6356, "text": "And that's a lot of what people are here to do is collaborate together, work together, think of things that you wanna build and go do it."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "And I don't know, one of the things that I just think is striking, so I teach my daughters some basic coding with Scratch."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "I mean, they're still obviously really young, but I think of coding as building, where it's like when I'm coding, I'm building something that I want to exist."}, {"time": 6382, "text": "But my youngest daughter, she's very musical and pretty artistic and she thinks about coding as art."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "She calls it code art, not the code, but the output of what she is making."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "It's like, she's just very interesting visually in what she can kind of output and how it can move around."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "And do we need to fix that?"}, {"time": 6407, "text": "Do we have to clap, Alexa?"}, {"time": 6409, "text": "Yeah, so I was just talking about Augie and her code art, but I mean, to me, this is like a beautiful thing, right?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "The notion that like for me, coding was this functional thing and I enjoyed it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it like helped build something utilitarian, but that for the next generation of people, it will be even more an expression of their kind of imagination and artistic sense for what they want to exist."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "So I don't know if that happens, if we can help bring about this world where a lot more people can, that that's like their existence going forward is being able to basically create and live out all these different kinds of art."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "I just think that that's like a beautiful and wonderful thing and will be very freeing for humanity to spend more of our time on the things that matter to us."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "Yeah, allow more and more people to express their art in the full meaning of that word."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "That's a beautiful vision."}, {"time": 6466, "text": "We mentioned that you are mortal."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "And are you afraid of it?"}, {"time": 6481, "text": "You didn't sign up for this on a podcast, did you?"}, {"time": 6483, "text": "No, I mean, it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "I mean, I'm definitely aware of it."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "I do a fair amount of like extreme sport type stuff."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "So like, so I'm definitely aware of it."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "And you're flirting with it a bit."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "I train hard."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I mean, so it's like, if I'm gonna go out in like a 15 foot wave."}, {"time": 6507, "text": "Go out big."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "Well, then it's like, all right, I'll make sure we have the right safety gear and like make sure that I'm like used to that spot and all that stuff."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But like, but you know, I mean, you."}, {"time": 6517,

of, as you go through different waves of technology, I think a lot of what is interesting is what becomes in practice infinite or kind of there can be many, many of a thing and then what ends up still being constrained."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "So the metaverse should hopefully allow a very large number or maybe in practice, hopefully close to an infinite amount of expression and worlds, but

I certainly think people kind of getting sick and dying is a bad thing because, and I'm dedicating almost all of my capital towards advancing research in that area to push on that, which I mean, we could do a whole, another one of these podcasts about that because that's a fascinating topic."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "I mean, this is with your wife Priscilla Chan, you formed the Chan Zuckerberg

on there, including the sort of moonshot of eradicating disease by the mid century marker."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "I don't actually know if you're gonna ever eradicate it, but I think you can get to a point where you can either cure things that happened, right?"}, {"time": 6680, "text": "So people get diseases, but you can cure them."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "Prevent is probably closest to eradication or just be able to manage as sort of like ongoing things that are not gonna ruin your life."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "And I think that that's possible."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "I think saying that there's gonna be no disease at all probably is not possible within the next several decades."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "Basic thing is increase the quality of life and maybe keep the finiteness because it makes everything taste more delicious."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "Maybe that's just being a romantic 20th century human."}, {"time": 6714, "text": "Maybe, but I mean, but it was

I would just wanna know that Priscilla and my family, like if they were gonna be okay."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "That might depend on the circumstances of my death."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "But I think that in most circumstances that I can think of, that's probably the main thing that I would care about."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "Yeah, I think God will hear that question and be like, all right, fine, you get in."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "That's the right question to ask."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "The humility and selfishness."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "All right, you're in."},

many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn't give a single answer to even simple questions."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer."}, {"time": 508, "text": "Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn't mean that it's one idea."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So if you take

line about North Korea."}, {"time": 889, "text": "He was full of incredibly good lines."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens."}, {"time": 894, "text": "One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready wit that you can't triumph over laughter."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It doesn't matter if your argument is better, if your quip is better, you win."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe in

debate to another, from LA to San Diego."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And the entire time he said, we just can't talk about religion."}, {"time": 953, "text": "So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about scotch."}, {"time": 959, "text": "He was inexhaustible."}, {"time": 962, "text": "I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one I began

"What are you crazy?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And he said, just have a beer, it's water."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "So he was, he really was a constant, inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit, to have him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So I think, unrelated to Scotch, yeah, unrelated to Scotch."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "He convinced me that the idea, I mean, I had my doubts about it and have

he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all, but I almost feel as though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely upset by the forms that religion took in this world."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes by his own eloquence and intellectual range."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything, I think he did that deliberately provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "So I don't know, I think he

with."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "In fact, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein, and then Sam did one."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make those unfounded assertions without challenging them, and you just let them go."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And I think that there was something to that was like, he finds it hard to have a conversation about religion that doesn't arouse his real ire about the harm that he thinks religion does in the world."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So it's more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the really fundamental..."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "I think he also thinks

approach."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "They believe that myth is the way the world works."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And so it's not that big a leap to God, but there's still a distance there."},

it's different than Christianity."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "I've had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts about theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion, it's a religious family."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And so you're born Jewish."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, oh, I believe in

recording things."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors."}, {"time":

like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity."}, {"time": 967, "text": "But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a

stuff."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I think it's better that there's more artists."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation

this."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard."},

millions of dollars."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "Yeah, that's really hard to argue with."}, {"time":

it."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So you can get."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So automate the manager?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's

"Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the,

think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music."}, {"time": 1490, "text":

this."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "That's really brilliant actually."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band

money."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into."},

capitalism."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "Like, I don't think we should not have private

capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're

like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like,

like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that

listen to a few songs?"}, {"time": 678, "text": "Because you mentioned Harry Nelson, and I was actually, yesterday and the day before, listening to a lot of his stuff, and it's just like, damn, he's good."}, {"time": 688, "text": "And not as known as he should be."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Like, I was getting, do you mind if I play?"}, {"time": 695, "text": "No, please, yeah."}, {"time": 697,

730, "text": "And just the sadness of, like, there's something, I don't even wanna talk over him, because this is one of my favorite songs, too, but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator."}, {"time": 750, "text": "And music, in my opinion, whenever I meet a young artist and say, well, I'm trying to make a new band, and I wanna do something like how to be successful, I really think understanding that people have a really good bullshit indicator is the most important part of being an artist."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And I'll explain what that means, at least to me."},

me."}, {"time": 868, "text": "It's like a song or even a painting, like, it's just the truthfulness of it."}, {"time": 876, "text": "Yeah, the truly great art goes, has to go to that place where you really are feeling it."}, {"time": 884, "text": "Like, you forget that you're being recorded."}, {"time": 886, "text": "You forget there's an audience."}, {"time": 887, "text": "You really are feeling

song."}, {"time": 915, "text": "But I was a little bit, maybe a lot, since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken that to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs."}, {"time": 924, "text": "But I like, for example, Rocketman, Elton John, like, to find out that Elton John didn't really know where the words of Rocketman came from, meaning, like, the depths of it, it's interesting."}, {"time":

in his mind and goes to that place emotionally."}, {"time": 961, "text": "Yeah, and that's what I think it is."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And that's why an actor, like I said, can be completely honest to me."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Maybe they didn't write the script."}, {"time": 968, "text": "But I write, like, I've always written all my own lyrics."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It's a really personal thing to me."}, {"time": 974, "text": "But I will say, I see people all the time who are performers like Elton John, for instance, who didn't write the lyrics that I believe that it means just as much to them as what I wrote, because they find the meaning in it for themself."}, {"time": 993, "text": "At least the greats do."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And I think that's the difference maker."}, {"time": 997, "text": "And I think you can perceive, and I'm sure you've seen art that doesn't move you, and maybe it moves someone else."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "But for you, for some reason, you perceive it to be uninteresting to you."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And I feel like a lot of the time, I'm saying that it's, of course, sonically, maybe it's uninteresting to you."},

it, right?"}, {"time": 1055, "text": "It's like, it's the feeling of exactly, and the same person could say that word 10 other ways and you don't care."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "But someone says

him."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "She went to."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "When I think of all my sorrow, and I had you there, but then I let you go."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "And then the chorus says, I can't live if

seen about his life too, but he was a real alcoholic at the end of his life and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "And so when I hear that, I perceive it as someone who is destructive and in a destructive place in life and can't love someone properly."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And so they can't live with them, but they can't live without them type thing, which is really something that I really identify with and I think is one of the struggles of life is loving yourself enough, forgiving yourself for things and letting yourself love someone else."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And at least when I listened out, I hear Harry being like, and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I perceive it at least is not loving himself and feeling like he's

quite a bit of it because my wife really loves it and she watches it in bed at night."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "So it's raw, to me it's really, because you've mentioned how complicated love can be and it's, I've never seen, I don't care about the celebrity nature of it."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "I don't care if it was, I don't care who it is, but it's just laid out in such raw form."},

after it's all over, many, many decades after it's all over."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "That book in particular written by the person that was actually there and so here we're seeing two people in the context of the courtroom analyzing this rise and fall of a love affair."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "You know the truth is, I was telling my wife this actually just the other day because she was asking me what I thought about it."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "It makes me really sad."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "It's humorous, don't get me wrong."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "There's a lot of parts in it

charismatic and you love him and he's funny and the way he does things and he looks certain ways and he says things."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "You really love him and I feel like, and maybe I'm wrong on this but it looks like the internet is really, Johnny is the winner, Amber is the villain and I kind of look at it and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom?"}, {"time": 1396, "text": "Were any of you there for these things?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And I'm not saying one way or the other."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "All I see when I look at that is two people with a lot of deep seeded hurt, anger and that anger is so poisonous to both of them and they're getting through it in the way that they only know how and I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to look at parts of it and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something but just that there's not a hero."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, I think unless you've been living with Amber and Johnny, you don't know and just because one seems more charismatic in the moment or funnier or more believable even, doesn't mean that their truth is the truth."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And I feel like there's still love there too, which makes the whole thing."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Oh, that's the hardest part."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "He won't even look at her."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "He looks down the whole time

love laid out in this raw kind of way."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "It makes me feel better about, it almost gives you, seeing people have gone through a struggle in this sort of mundane kind of way, gives you room to struggle yourself about the messiness of love."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Like you're supposed to, like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever but this like, oh, man, this."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "It's like art."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And for the record, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "I think it's actually really beautiful art and I agree there's gonna be a lot of people who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways or look at things different."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "I'm not saying it's changed in the whole world, the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "It's just like you would look at a painting and it might affect you."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "My only commentary is more that there's not, I think it's silly when people say who's right and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and who's the, like we love as human, we have to have an answer for every, we have to put everything in a box."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And it's like, well, we're looking at this and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And I just think it's silly

that correlation out to me personally a long time ago."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized by certain movies."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "The lows define the beauty of this town."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And certain movies, so to me, Casino with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone, leaving Las Vegas with Nicolas Cage, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with the Johnny Depp play, Hunter S. Thompson."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "First of all, what's your favorite representation of Vegas from a darker side?"}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And do you draw any wisdom insight from the darkness, the lows and the highs in those movies?"}, {"time": 1609, "text": "Or is it over romanticized?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Those were like the two very different worlds that created what Vegas is."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways because Vegas has the strip and the parties and the craziness."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "But it also has very neighborhoods and big families and conservative people and liberal people living together in a really interesting way."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And for me, growing up here, for instance, was a lot of driving on the freeway, my mom being like, children, close your eyes."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "There's a naked woman on that billboard and everything."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Okay, mom, on our way to church."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "It was like, but also being like, whoa, this is crazy."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "Like taking in whatever I could when I could."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So I saw, and I'm grateful for that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Like, I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon in for instance, like Utah or something, like the typical place, because I saw both sides and I appreciated something from both sides."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "And now as a person now who's not religious, but just spiritually minded, you know, I'm grateful for that divergent character, that juxtaposition, dual edged sword that Vegas is."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And I try to apply that to everything in life, which is like Johnny Depp and Amber."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "It's like, there's two sides to every story."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "There's always two sides to every coin."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "There's always, and there's something to be said for both."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Like I try to see people and even if, you know, it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "As far as a movie that personifies Vegas or something in that medium that personifies Vegas in a way that resonates with me."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Don't say Hangover."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "No, no, yeah."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I also like, I wasn't even allowed to watch PG 13 movies growing up."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So a lot of the movies that you're saying, like I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "You know, I wasn't like a pilgrim, but I had a really, really conservative upbringing."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "So it didn't define your intellectual like development."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie that comes to mind where I'm like, that's my Vegas movie."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Like, I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said now, but I don't, I can't think of one that I'm like, actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels honest to me."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Like, or like, wasn't there a Chevy, was there a Chevy Chase?"}, {"time": 1770, "text": "I think that's maybe the only one I thought of that came to mind where I was like, cause I love Chevy Chase so much that maybe it's one of his Vegas vacation or something."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "Yeah, so, but that's more like lighthearted surge, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Right, it's not like, I guess what I would say is there's no truth that has been, that I've seen of Vegas."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "Cause what I see of Vegas is, there's obviously like the parties and stuff and the nightlife, which I'm not big party person."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So it's, I haven't really experienced much of that, but there's also drugs and I have a strange relationship with drugs because I've lost a few friends to drug overdoses."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And so I don't, that's not romantic to me, but there's also like, yeah, I mean, you asked for a dark reflection of it."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "I guess I certainly see a dark reflection to Vegas."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "And I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified as like at the tables and everything."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "But it's also like, I have like friends who've lost all their money to gambling addiction."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "And so it's like, what I guess the whole thing."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "Yeah, somebody maybe needs to make, maybe that's an open spot."},

vicious cycle, like you could never be famous enough."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "You're always going to get like, there's just so much to it that I've just, and again, like I've lost friends in this career to do that for sure."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "And there's a certain element to sort of just on the losing fame of interacting with a lot of folks, especially young folks like on YouTube."},

it doesn't matter how famous you are, you're always trying to chase more."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "And when you start to lose it, interesting things can happen if you're not self aware, which is like, like you mentioned, you might be trying to grasp back at where you were by leaning into the formula that got you there."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned becomes the thing that you're now trying to lean into."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And that's actually walking away from who you really are."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "Like you lean further into being that person."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "That's true for acting."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "That's true for even on like YouTube, which is people acting, they have a role."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "They got them to the table somehow."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "Yeah, it's dark, but I think those are, that's just put for everybody to see, but that's a very human struggle even when you're not famous."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "Finding yourself, being yourself, of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale and being trapped by that."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Yeah, and also feeling like it's never enough."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "I think that's something all, like it's not just a famous thing, but it's like in the whole, like everybody deals with feeling like when I'm here, I'll be happy."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "When I get that job, I'll be happy."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "When I have that money, then I'll be happy."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "When I get that

going to find it."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "You're never gonna arrive and you're just gonna live your life and then you're gonna be on your death bed and be like, I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "So for me personally, because you just talk a lot, you can't, people that meet you, they know you and they know the evolution of you."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And that's the same thing for like you right now, Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast like long form reveals a side that liberates you more to be yourself, to like, people see, oh, there's a human."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "They, cause they, music, they have a deep connection with you, they have experiences with you the way they experienced it and that's who you are with them through the songs."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "But now you get to see, oh, that's a human being."}, {"time": 3566,

get to see, oh, you've lost yourself in the surface."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "That's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "They've left so much of themselves in the roles they've played that they can no longer be the thing they were before, those great roles."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "That's for sure, it's hard, it's hard to see."}, {"time": 3611, "text":

forever, forever that guy."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "But the point is to remember that you're not into your family, which is interesting you said with your family, when I see people close to me, they also, there is an element like that while you're that, they start treating you like the famous person."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Yeah, I'm fortunate to have my manager who's my brother, my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And that's been helpful because it's weird, it gets weird with everyone no matter what."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "One of

with me forever and it's Charlie Sheen, so of course it sticks with you."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen, I'm not Charlie Sheen, it's not gonna get weird, like, you know."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "But it got really, really weird, really quick, because suddenly you've existed your whole life in this way where everybody just, everything you get, you achieved, it was because you got it."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "And every conversation you had, like, if someone liked you at the end of that conversation, well, it's because they liked you."},

whole life."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "I was like, life is a challenge."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "And be myself and I'm gonna go through it and find some people along the way that I connect with and others, no."}, {"time": 3725, "text": "And that social integrity is so important to us."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "And we think it would be nice to have this, and this is going back to the pitfalls of fame."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "We think it would be nice to walk into a room and have everyone be like, and you could be like, dumpster fire."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "And everybody's like, oh my

"text": "And it just breaks everything that you knew about humanness."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "And it sucks."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "So then you're seeking out people who, that it doesn't exist with."}, {"time": 3764, "text": "And family is the closest you can get to that for sure."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "But even your family, it's gonna take a little bit where they're like, oh, this is a little weird."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Like all my friends at work are now asking about you and you're my young, stupid brother."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "But now you're suddenly like the young,

meet people too who know about this whole concept and they're like, well, I'm gonna be an asshole to him to show him that I don't subscribe."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "And you're dealing with like people who are like, dumpster fire, the person who's like, you could say something actually profound and nice and they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "Cause it's like an actual attempt to like show you how much they don't care."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "So you live in this very, like this."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "Still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you, you were seeking for deep human connection with a small number of people."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "And now when a lot of people know you, you're still looking for deep connection with a small number of people."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "The struggle is the same."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Can you speak to, cause you mentioned some of the dark moments."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "What advice would you give to people who are struggling with depression?"}, {"time": 3833, "text": "And maybe for the people who love the people who are struggling with depression."}, {"time": 3840,

you're really depressed, that actually feels like nothing."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Cause the things that brought you joy, don't bring you joy anymore."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "When I'm really in the thick of it."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "But for me, like this is the cycle that I'll go through is I'll look at my life and I'll say, okay, what can I clean up?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "All right, well, for me it was cutting out alcohol actually helped me a lot."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "I know that sounds like a big, I'm not judging anybody for that."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And I still drink on occasion, but I felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful to my mental state."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "Feel less drive and less happiness the next day for things that I wanna do."},

had a lot of, I've seen a lot of therapists and all of them say the same thing, which is like, you have major depressive disorder and this is what it is, but it's certainly worse for me in the winter months."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "So I know there's like, I can't think of the term for it, but there's a term for like seasonal depression."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "So I'll get to the winter and

practice those things."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "Absolutely see a therapist."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "That's my biggest, like my biggest emphasis of life is to like on stage, like my goal, like I have a few things that I really, really care about."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "One is mental health and destigmatizing therapy."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "Cause for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex who doesn't have to go to a therapist because Lex is stronger."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "So be strong like Lex."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "I would like look at all my older brothers and I looked up to them so much and they're all these incredibly successful people, plastic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist, two attorneys, Stanford, NYU, like just like incredible high standards, Eagle Scouts, you know, like they valedictorians, like they just did it all."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit and none of them went to therapy."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "So it was like, what are you going to be?"}, {"time": 4016, "text": "Are you, oh, you're broken."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Are you like the weak one who can't hack life?"}, {"time": 4021, "text": "And I think that's incredibly dangerous."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "And I feel like it almost cost me my life because I took so long to finally go to therapy."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "So I really want kids to know, hey, like the great people that achieve great things that are doing amazing things, they probably have help, almost all of them."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym."},

that's."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "I think you'd be a good one."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "Maybe, I would."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "I think you are a psychiatrist, pretty much, right?"}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Sounds like you're a psychiatrist."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "I think I need more."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "I think actually, to be a good psychiatrist, you also need to be seeking therapy from the, like you also need to be, have some stuff to work through in your mind."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places."}, {"time": 4076, "text":

"text": "What is the process of therapy, if you can just educate a little more?"}, {"time": 4096, "text": "Is it, are you basically bringing to the surface and talking through things that you, because of the momentum of life, you just never allow yourself to speak through, to think through?"}, {"time": 4112, "text": "Is that what therapy is?"}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Or is there some more systematic thing?"}, {"time": 4116, "text": "So I've been to a lot of strange, different kinds of therapy."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "So I'll tell you my first therapist."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "If I could sort of interrupt, how hard is it to find a therapist that connected with you?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "I think, I think it for, well, actually I have a skewed view of that, because going back to the beginning of my therapy was with a Mormon therapist."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "So it was very much like, well, are you reading your book of Mormon?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "And are you praying at night?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "Like, that was a big focus of my therapy to begin with."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And you're having a faith crisis in the distance somewhere."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "Yes, I was like, well, and then."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "You're making it worse."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "Yes, the next therapist I went to was a Scientology therapist."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time, and she's not anymore."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "She's like, it's such a funny thing to look back on, because we met, and I was like this Mormon missionary who had just got home from his mission, and I met her, and she's a Scientologist."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "I was like, wow, that's batshit crazy."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "Like, that stuff's crazy."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "And she's like, what are you talking about?"}, {"time": 4184, "text": "That's your crazy, you're a Mormon."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "That's batshit crazy."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "And the two of us were like, huh, maybe there's something to this, to both of us here."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Yeah, the tension actually forces you to think through, oh, well, what is true?"}, {"time": 4198, "text": "Yeah, and we really fell in love through that, which was like, maybe we're both on the wrong track."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Let's figure this out."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "But before that happened, we went to a Scientologist therapist, who that therapy consisted of, what have you done wrong to Asia?"}, {"time": 4217, "text": "And they would ask me that question over and over and over and over, until I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things that were in the recesses of my mind."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "This was marriage therapy."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "Anyway, I'm not gonna get into that, but it was Scientology therapy."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "So that was a different thing."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And then I went to therapy therapy, like no, not attached to any religion."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "And that was a really great experience for me."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "And since then I've been through a couple of different therapists, but that was more because where I was and moving and things like that."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "So is it that hard to find a great therapist?"}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Probably not, but maybe don't go to your Mormon therapist versus that Scientology therapist."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "Or maybe that's the route for you."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "Maybe it's the route for you, I don't know."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Yeah, but what is, so is it bringing stuff to the surface, basically?"}, {"time": 4262, "text": "Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't even answer your question."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "What's the effect, why is it so effective?"}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Just, is there something you could put words to?"}, {"time": 4270, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's, obviously, there's the common things you would think of, which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in that I don't wanna tell anybody, and then I tell this person, and oh, there's relief in that."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "But that's really not where the real work comes from."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "I think the real work is meeting with someone who is well versed and educated and understands."}, {"time": 4289, "text": "It's like coding."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "You put in work, and you have hard conversations and do difficult things, and if, so if your therapy's not difficult, I actually think that's not good therapy."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Good therapy is, it's gonna be a little difficult, it's work, like."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "During and after."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "Yes, like I had this incredible therapist who was, I told him when I was gonna do ayahuasca, he was like, geez, you know, he had actually was a doctor before and a really well educated studied person who had walked away from brain doctor, what's the word for that, brain doctor?"}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Brain surgeon?"}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Neurologist."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "Oh yeah, neurologist, yep."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "And he said, well basically his belief was that ayahuasca was like basically doing therapy like 50 sessions."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "He was like, it's like really intensive."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "He was like, I don't know if you wanna do that, if you do, you can make some big steps forward, but I prefer just to do one session at a time."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "And so yeah, it's hard work."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And that, I typically like, it's really hard for me to even talk about ayahuasca by the way, going back to that, because I'm not looking to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "It's incredibly hard."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "It was the scariest experience of my entire life."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "It felt like I went to heaven, but it also felt like I went to the darkest, deepest hell that was incredibly scary, incredibly scary, yeah."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So you told the story of how you wrote the song Believer or like your childhood friend, I guess, Donald, like bullying and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "This song, I mean, a lot of your songs are super interesting sort of in terms of percussion, super interesting, super interesting lyrically, just how it flows and also pain is at the center of it."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith, some of these existential questions are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "Maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see, but it's there."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "And this song is really interesting in that way that it puts pain, you made me a believer."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "You break me down, you build me up, Believer."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "Maybe can you tell the story of how the song came to be?"}, {"time": 4462, "text": "I'd love to listen to it too."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "I have some questions musically about it too."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's exactly what we're talking about with therapy."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "I just feel like the greatest things in my life have come from the deepest hurt, like losing someone, that you love is maybe the hardest part of the human path for me, at least thus far."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "There's like, you think of physical pain or maybe like going through financial pain or whatever."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I think losing someone that you really love to death is one of the hardest, for me, I would say it was the hardest."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "But it also makes you look at your life completely differently and alter your life, at least for me in ways that were really healthy."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "Being more present, letting go of things that were meaningless, trying to control what other people think about you, like wasting your time on things like that."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "And you suddenly see like, wow, like time, I got small amount of time, like how do I wanna spend it?"}, {"time": 4531, "text": "I'm gonna spend it in the best way I know how and that's it."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "So, yeah, I mean, it's a basic concept that's been said a million times over in a million different ways."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "But that's pretty much what I was trying to say with Believer which is like, I've lost faith in everything at that time period or previous to that time period."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "And then I was rebuilding my faith or my spiritual thought process."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "And it was after ayahuasca and it was like, finding, being a Believer and that's not necessarily like a Believer in God or a Believer in heaven and hell or anything like that, but a Believer in more."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "Believing in goodness, believing in that there is some light like, and again, those words like, they're just words and I wish there were better words to formulate the thought that I'm trying to express, but just more, like the thought of me dying, for me, I don't fear it, I don't fear it, but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "I'll say that, that is fearful for me."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "I feel like I love so deeply these children that the thought of like leaving them for me is a scary thought or something."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "They're kind of good reminder how much you love life actually."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "And you don't always remember that."},

was right."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you an example."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "There was a song on the record called Number One."}, {"time": 5270, "text":

believe."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "When it's all been said and done, I'm still my number one."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "And he was like, nah, it just makes me cringe when I hear that."}, {"time":

5303, "text": "Like, you know, it's about like self love."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "He's like, yeah, but like, do you need to like talk about self love like that?"}, {"time": 5309, "text": "And I was like, well, I feel like I need to."}, {"time": 5311, "text": "He's like, well, maybe, you know, there's something else we could say there."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "Like we just kept, you know, we kept coming back to this song, okay?"}, {"time": 5318, "text": "I was like, and I changed it."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "I tried changing it."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "What did I change it to?"},

you, it's definitely sounding cringy to other people too."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "And that sucks."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "But I don't know how else to say this in a way that I want to put that song out anymore."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "But there were other songs for sure where Rick was like, that or this, that word feels a little trite."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "You already said that once."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "Can you say it in a different way?"}, {"time": 5354, "text": "It was really helpful."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "It's really interesting because you're trying to say something so simply and yet not make it cringe."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "That's a strange art form because you want to say some of the greatest love songs."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "I mean, we

feels like silky."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "No word catches your mind as cringy."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "But then music, I think great speeches are like that too, or just conveying, communicating ideas simply."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "That's the art form is to not be cringy."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "And then yet, because like when you're raw and real, it might at first feel cringy."},

got open mic, so I just listen to musicians."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "Like when they write songs, like they fail that test."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "They write simple stuff, but it's cringy."},

our circles was the Apple II."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And I was just like, that's it."}, {"time": 548, "text": "So I went, jumped up and down."}, {"time": 551, "text": "It was very expensive."},

was like crazy, right?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money as I can this summer."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And my grandfather said, cause he helped me learn all about tools and build things together."}, {"time": 569, "text": "I will match whatever you make so you can get this computer."}, {"time": 572, "text": "So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy."},

585, "text": "And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And you couldn't tear it away from me."}, {"time": 590, "text": "It was my friend."}, {"time": 591, "text": "It was everything."}, {"time": 592, "text": "From a product perspective, what do you remember that was brilliant?"}, {"time": 596, "text": "The design choices, the ideas behind it, or is it just that it exists?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "Or the very idea of a personal computer is the brilliant design choice."}, {"time": 607, "text": "Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I could program it anyways."}, {"time": 614, "text": "There was no, you know, there was no internet connection."}, {"time": 616,

624, "text": "And then there was the whole other thing which was started happening, which we were doing."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff."}, {"time": 630, "text": "We were sharing software, right?"}, {"time": 632, "text": "So you built this community of sharing software."}, {"time": 634, "text": "You would go and pirate."}, {"time": 635, "text": "That was what it called, pirate all this software."}, {"time": 637, "text": "You'd never use it all, but it was just that fun thing of like, I'm gonna get all this other stuff and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it and see behind the scenes."}, {"time": 645, "text": "So you really had a sense this was your world and you owned it, right?"}, {"time": 650, "text": "And you could like literally go into every register."}, {"time": 652, "text": "We didn't have all those security layers."}, {"time": 653, "text": "Like we do not like, you could really touch bits and you could poke bits and you can make this light turn on."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And the geek assignment just lit up."}, {"time": 661, "text": "Now there's, it's so abstract."}, {"time": 665, "text": "People don't even understand."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Like usually some programs don't even understand memory."}, {"time": 669, "text": "They just think it's unlimited, right?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "And security, it's like, now there's all this security you should have, but it's like the adults all showed up to the party and now you can't have all the fun, right?"}, {"time": 681, "text": "It's like, no, no."}, {"time": 683, "text": "This was the thing where if you, if the power went out, you lost your whole program, you might've worked a whole day on it."}, {"time": 688, "text": "And if you didn't press save at every other line and you were to save, save, save, and it would like, the disk drive or the tape drive."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Like every single step was contemplated because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work."}, {"time": 705, "text": "So a lot of the magic was in the software."}, {"time": 707, "text": "The fact that you could have software, the fact that you could share software, the community around the software, it wasn't necessarily the hardware."}, {"time": 715, "text": "Well, that was the first step."}, {"time": 716, "text": "The second step around the hardware was I got things like the mocking board, which the mocking board paired with the music construction set, you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II."}, {"time": 729, "text": "So you would plug in this card and you go, oh my God, look at this."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And it would, you know, you could start generating cool sounds."}, {"time": 735, "text": "You know, like it was a Moog, you know, like a Moog in a way, early Moog."}, {"time": 740, "text": "What year are we talking about?"}, {"time": 741, "text": "This is 82, I think, 81, 82."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds that are very cool in the 80s."}, {"time": 750, "text": "Yeah, the 8 bit, you know, chip tunes, right?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick, you had to pull a chip out and you had to like plug in a dip socket to put in a joystick."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And then I was like, oh, and then I had to get more memory."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And now I wanted to speed up progress."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So then that turned into a company actually from that, but it was, and a hardware software went at that."}, {"time": 774, "text": "But it was all about, you know, modifying this thing in every way, first with software."}, {"time": 778, "text": "And then you started gaining confidence."}, {"time": 780, "text": "And then I got a little bit more money and stuff."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And then you could get into the hardware and, you know, wire things."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?"}, {"time": 789, "text": "So in the back, in the early Apple IIs, you could open up and all the schematics were there."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So you purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Yeah, it came with it."}, {"time": 799, "text": "That's an interesting choice."}, {"time": 801, "text": "That's an interesting choice from a company perspective."}, {"time": 805, "text": "Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like this is."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Absolutely intentional."}, {"time": 814, "text": "This is for the cutting edge folks too, or especially for the cutting edge."}, {"time": 818, "text": "It was only the cutting edge."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It was geeks for geeks."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So we were like, oh, how did they make it?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "And then we got to learn through that."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Apple I did the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "It just Apple II became more packaged up and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "Came with basic and then, you know, so it was really, it was what we might think of as a raspberry pie today or something like that, but not with so much software."}, {"time": 841, "text": "It was literally, and all the chips were out there so you could inspect the buses and the, right?"}, {"time": 846, "text": "Cause everything was just broken out."}, {"time": 848, "text": "So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects and open source, like on GitHub, that you have the schematics there and it's kind of a product, but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Like we're going to release this to a small set of people, self selected, perhaps that are kind of the makers, the cutting edge folks, the builders, the at home engineers, like in some way, what Tesla is doing with the beta for the full self driving is kind of like that."}, {"time": 887, "text": "It's like selecting a group of people, but that has to do more with you, how safe of a driver you are versus how much of a tinkerer you are because you don't get to tinker."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do for really cutting edge technologies, especially you're interested in like hardware stuff."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Is that crazy?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Why don't more companies do that kind of thing, you think?"}, {"time": 910, "text": "I think back then it was about a community and serving that community of builders."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Now this is about people who want to take, get the experience and want it really simple and easy."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And they're like, and so there's the audience or they believe the audience is small who would value those other things that we're just talking about."}, {"time": 929, "text": "But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi and all of these other little boards, right?"}, {"time": 933, "text": "There's a whole world more than I've seen."}, {"time": 936, "text": "Like it's amazing what you can do now with these little kits and the software that's created."}, {"time": 943, "text": "And so there's a whole nother, I think another batch of makers and builders that are coming up through the ranks."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And if you, we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "They take these little boards, they hack them, then they print out parts on their 3D printer, assemble them and they create robots and what have you."}, {"time": 959, "text": "So I think it's happening."}, {"time": 961, "text": "It's just not as, you know, as, it's just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be, but it's there and it's really expanding around the world."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And that's really nice to see cause you know, it's a whole new generation who can, who are empowered."}, {"time": 977, "text": "I think there's a semi dormant genius amongst millions."}, {"time": 981, "text": "So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit."}, {"time": 983, "text": "It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised if it's several million Raspberry Pis that have been sold."}, {"time": 990, "text": "I think more than that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius, brewing of engineers who don't get to hear because they're not organized."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "I mean, we get to hear their inklings here and there."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities that are local and so on."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "But if they were organized, if a leader would emerge, no."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Okay, so when did you first start to dream about building your own things, designing your own products, designing your own systems and software and hardware?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Well, in high school, there was a company that a friend of mine founded and I was the second employee, it was called Quality Computers."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And it was a mail order, mail order cause there's no eCommerce then, there was no internet again."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "You either mailed in your little coupon and you said, this is what I wanted to order or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Turn around time and this stuff was like, from the time you wanted, the time you bought it was maybe eight to 12 weeks."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "That was just the normal way of getting things."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too and it was software and all kinds of accessories."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So hardware accessories, so hardware, plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "And what we noticed was there were accelerators or memory cards."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And to be able to use those cards, you had to actually go and change the software you use to access this new memory."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So you literally had to go and you took the program that you had, let's say it was Apple works, which was like an early Microsoft office or something like that."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "And you had to literally change the code and you would install all these patches to then take advantage of the hardware."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "So what we started creating was software on top of it to do the automatic installation of all of these patches."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So we made it much easier to take new hardware and the existing software you have and expand it into this new world."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So it was creating tools and the really great customer support."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And we started getting a lot of orders because we had the software make it easier to install, to give them the superpower."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "And at the same time, they would be able to change their software and have a new world that wasn't existing from the companies that were creating the initial products."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And so it was more of that."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And then that happened with hard drives."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II to like read, because you could get really fragmented."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So I wrote that piece of software and we sold that through the company along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So that all happened in 12th grade, freshman year of college."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade for the Apple II."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Between 12th and freshman year."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "What programming language do you remember?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Is it assemblies?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "There were certain inner loops were assembly and other loops actually there were really early Pascal, no C compilers."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "What was the motivation behind these?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "Is it to make people's lives easier?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Is it to create a thing experience that is simpler and simpler and simpler, thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Or did you just like to tinker?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "No, no, no, it was two things really."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware and software."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And then the other thing was, because I was also manning the customer support line, people would call in and go, this doesn't work."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware and the installation process better."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "So my whole world was out of box experience from when I was in high school."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Cause I had to man the customer support line, pack the boxes and write some of the code while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason, who was the founder of Quality Computers, he was off doing the mark, the ads, placing the ads for the mail order, making sure we were running the credit cards, right?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "It was two of us."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And then it turned into a third, and then we hired another person from high school to like pack boxes so I could stay on the customer support line or doing the software, right?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And it was all in his parents basement, right?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "As you were scaling exponentially."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So we'll jump around a little bit, but what were the, you said you love music."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod if we jump forward and how far back do those ideas stretch?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "If you look at the history of technology, there's, I mean, not just the product, but the idea is truly revolutionary."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Maybe it's time has come, but just if you look at the arc of history, sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And to be able to put that in your pocket, make it truly portable is fascinating in a way that's truly portable."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman or something like that."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?"}, {"time": 1309, "text": "You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Just loved music from, I think, second grade when I got my first albums and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "What kind of music are we talking about?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So this was Led Zeppelin."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, Stix, Ted Nugent, just the real American and

grade, fourth grade."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I just fell in love."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And then we moved back to Detroit and I loved listening to the radio station because there was all kinds of crazy music because you'd have an amalgam of rock and then funk and R&B and I loved to listen at night."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "So I had a clock radio."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But if I had the clock radio on, everyone, parents would go, go to sleep."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Turn that stuff off."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it."},

just sit there and, you know."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Just huddling around the radio."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Groove out."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Just listening to Zeppelin."}, {"time": 1395,

oh, okay."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And now if we have enough flash or DRAM, we can put 10, 15, what have you all in that same memory."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And it starts to replicate a CD."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive, you could start to put, you know, thousands of songs."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "Yeah, that's also another brilliant invention."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "But like, people don't realize, I think people would be surprised how big in terms of storage raw audio is."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And the fact that you can compress it, like, I don't know what the compression is, but it's like 10X, it's very significant compression."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "And still it sounds almost lossless."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Much to the chagrin of Neil Young, who does not like that."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about is still tiny files relative to the raw."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more, a little bit more."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "But it's still, that's an invention."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "That's a thing that unlocks your ability to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Because without that, there's no way you can carry on a gigantic hard drive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And so then that, so it was MP3s, the Nino, and my, you know, my hatred of carrying around all this heavy stuff that then spawned, you know, fuse and then ultimately, you know, became a lot of that, the ideas and things of that nature were, and my passions were born into then the iPod."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "You know, it was too, Apple needed something and I wanted to fix something and it all kind of, you know, came together at the right place, right time, plus the right technology came at this."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "It was just like the stars aligned."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So how did it come to life?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "The details of the stars aligning, but the actual design, the actual engineering of getting a device to be small, the storage of the, you know, the interface, how it looks, the storage, the details of the software, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "What are some interesting memories from that design process?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "What are some wisdoms you can impart from that process?"}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Okay, well, you know, how long do you want to go?"}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Cause I have, I can go deep."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "So, let's go at least 20 hours."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "Let's go, this is one of the lengthy documentaries."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Are you going to turn it into episodic binge listening?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "Yeah, it's Game of Thrones."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So let's just start with, you know, after I was asked to be a consultant to put this thing together."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "So I already had knowledge of, you know, the space and the technology and all that stuff, but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers, because of what I was doing at Fuse, trying to create that thing."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "So as a contractor, I was like, okay, what is the first thing they need to do?"}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So after I showed a, you know, different architectures and what three different products could be to Steve about options for storage options, battery options, form factor options, there was three options."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And as I was told, given very good advice, give the two options you really do not like, but they're options, and give the best option last, because Steve will shoot all those down and give the best option last, and then you could talk about that."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive and a small screen, like the screen, you know it, and the original iPod, classic iPod."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "And then I had enough of the idea of the three or three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers and kind of systems that were out there that I had gone and found and put together on power supplies, you know, disk drive interfaces, firewire interface, all that stuff."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "So I put together all of those schematics or, you know, block diagrams."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "They weren't schematics yet, because it was just me."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And coming up with a bill of materials, coming up with what it could look like, what would be the input, output, how we could make a better headphone jack."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "That was also on there."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "So I got all kinds of different battery types."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "I got different types of, you know, in different battery sizes, double A's, triple A's, working through all the different, and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydride."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So I took all the battery types."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "I took all of the memory types, processing types, LCD types, and connectivity and all that stuff, not wireless, but wired, and laid out these things as Lego blocks."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So literally had all of these things as just, and so it made them so I could like, you know, put them together and figure out what the compact form factor would be."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Oh, like how do we shove them together?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "What's the smallest possible box you can get?"}, {"time": 1977, "text": "So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive, batteries, double A, triple A, screens."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "So screen size, and then for that, you're tearing apart calculators."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "Calculators, digital cameras, whatever, and getting little things, right?"}, {"time": 1992, "text": "So you can make it physical, right?"}, {"time": 1994, "text": "If you can make the intangible tangible, like, and so I can say, look, we can make this, and I brought this whole bag of goods, and it was like, right?"}, {"time": 2003, "text": "And like, here's this, here's this, this is why double A's won't work, and because it makes it too fat and everything."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So just educate everybody through, here's the parts that we can use."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "You should not sheet of paper, it's physical."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "You're playing in the physical space."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "Oh, I would go back and forth."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So truth be told, because there weren't a good enough graphical tools on the Mac, I was using a PC with Visio and some 3D tools, and I was doing 3D design at the same time I was taking all these physical parts and going, okay, what feels right?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Because you have to go from, you know, the details and then the rough, and you go back and forth and you iterate, right?"}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And so it was just a lot of fun."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "And then it ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model and printouts that came from Visio that I glued together and put my grandfather's fishing weights in, because I also modeled the weights, right?"}, {"time": 2051, "text": "So I said, oh, this is this many ounces, this is this many ounces and grams."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And then I went and got all that and made the, weighted these styrofoam models to then match that."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "So when you picked it up, it felt more or less form factor, right?"}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And it also, you felt how much, you know, was it gonna be dense enough?"}, {"time": 2069, "text": "Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?"}, {"time": 2074, "text": "Why does it need to feel rigid?"}, {"time": 2076, "text": "Because it has to feel substantial."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "It has to feel like I have like a, like a bar of gold in my hand, right?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "You know, maybe you know this, when you open and close a car door, you know that thunk and you go, bam, and you go, that feels solid, that feels real."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And then you get this tinny car that's like ding, and you're like, does this feel safe?"}, {"time": 2094, "text": "Does this feel like a value?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "And so you, when you have a device like that, and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it, that you distributed the density of the masses in the right way."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So it feels like it's the right thing."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "So you have to model battery life, costs, you know, mass, sizes of different things."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And then you have to also think about what the UI is gonna look like, right?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "You have all of these constraints you're working, variables

was also the buttons too, right?"}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?"}, {"time": 2141, "text": "Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "This was all independent."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "This was me before being able to present to Steve, because I had to feel really confident that if I was gonna put this in front of him, that it could be made, right?"}, {"time": 2155, "text": "So I had to convince myself and go work through all the details, through like the very, very rough mechanical design, electrical design, software things, because I didn't wanna present something that was gonna be fictional, right?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "My credibility would be like trashed, right?"}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So you mentioned convince yourself."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "You're painting this beautiful picture of a driven engineer, designer, futurist."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "How much doubt were you plagued by through that?"}, {"time": 2184, "text": "Like this is even doable, because it's not obvious that this is even doable."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing, to make it sexy, to shovel the screen, the batteries, the storage, to make the interface, the hardware and the software interface work, all of that."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "I would be overwhelmed by the doubt of that, because so many things have to work, plus the supply chain."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "Like at that point, I wasn't getting into any of those details or anything."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "There's the basic stuff that you have to put together."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And then you have to, through my learnings at General Magic and my learnings at Phillips and delivering multiple large scale programs and manufacturing, you kind of get a rule of thumb and you know what to focus on at the beginning and what not to worry about over time."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Like when I was early in my career, I worried about everything on the engineering details so much so that I would be a nervous wreck."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out and figure out what to prioritize."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And so 10 years later, I was able to do a much better job of filtering out the things of like, we'll get to that in weeks to come."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "But right now we gotta solve the very important things, which is could this actually be something real and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?"}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?"}, {"time": 2266, "text": "And the right price point."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "So you were sitting on a track record of successes and failures in your own mind where you had sort of already a confidence, a calmness, but still, was there a doubt that you can get this done?"}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Always, always."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence to a level where you could present it to Steve and actually believe that this is doable?"},

anyone in, right?"}, {"time": 2302, "text": "I couldn't let anyone in on this."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So it was just me."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2307, "text": "No, no, no, no, because I couldn't bring any, when I mean bring anyone in on this, one, it was a highly confidential program inside Apple."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "There was like four people who knew about it, right?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple because I was a contractor."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "I'm working for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?"}, {"time": 2325, "text": "In this contract."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So it was just, so I'm doing this."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Oh, and at the same time, I'm also buying every competitive product, MP3 player and tearing them all apart, right?"}, {"time": 2335, "text": "Tore them all apart and looking at them and trying to learn from those as well."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "So it was all of this stuff in six weeks."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "So I didn't sleep, right?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "But I was like, because I was trying to make this, I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?"}, {"time": 2352, "text": "And I was like, oh my God, right?"}, {"time": 2355, "text": "But there was another doubt that I had and it wasn't just, could you make the product?"}, {"time": 2359, "text": "But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "Because Apple was not the same company that you know it today in 2001."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful?"}, {"time": 2374, "text": "No, no, it was barely break even."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "It was a four or $5 billion company."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "So the guts required there is not necessarily in the innovation."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money and we're gonna potentially lose all of it because it'll be a flop."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "And the Mac wasn't doing very well."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "There was less, it was about a 1% only in the US market share for the Mac, right?"}, {"time": 2401, "text": "The company was in debt."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?"}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Michael Dell at the time was saying, shut down the company and give the money back to the shareholders."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "So this is not the company that people, oh my God, the iPhone came out."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "It's a very different level of confidence and financial situation that the company was in versus the iPod."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "So given that, what was the conversation when you finally presented to Steve?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Steve, what was that conversation like?"}, {"time": 2434, "text": "The conversation was, well, we went through it, the presentation and all that stuff happened."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "And he was just like, and he never, he would flip through it real quick, throw the presentation aside and said, okay, let's talk about this, right?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "And so we went through it all."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "And one was a big conversation about Sony."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And Sony was the number one in all audio categories, home, portable, whatever, in the world, okay?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "I had been already gone through 10 years of failure."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "And I was like, wait a second, how are we gonna compete with Sony?"}, {"time": 2470, "text": "And I was always worried that Sony was gonna come out with whatever it was that they were gonna come out with, their MP3 player."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "And that was it, game over, right?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "And so I was like, Steve, Steve, and this is why it took me four weeks to finally sign on to join Apple after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting, was because I had built other things in the past at Phillips, the Nino and Velo, but they didn't know how to sell it or market it."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "They didn't know how to retail it, right?"}, {"time": 2501, "text": "So I was like, we could build this."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?"}, {"time": 2508, "text": "You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And he looked at me and he goes, you build this with, you know, a team and our team and Apple and this and this and the me, right?"}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And I dedicate that we will make sure that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars will only go to this product and nothing else."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "Right, Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "So Steve saw something special here."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Exactly, and he said, I'm going to commit all the marketing dollars if you can deliver the experience that we're all talking about, if we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well, because iPod would have never happened without iTunes."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "You know, people don't understand that was a bundle."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "So Jeff and I were, you know, if Jeff and you can present and bring that experience to life, I will put all the marketing dollars behind it."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of, what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?"}, {"time": 2573, "text": "iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And so Jeff Robin had his company, oh man, I can't remember the name, but it was bought."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps like Winamp and other things that were on the PC, real player, and Steve saw that going on and saw that Jeff and his small team had this, I can't remember, sound something."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes and then Jeff ran all of iTunes."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "And so what happened specifically there was they were starting to hook up to all these third party MP3 players because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man, like Walkman, but MP man, all these, and they were trying to hook them up and they were like, these are horrible experiences."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And through that, and they said, iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base because we were trying to get more on the Mac."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "So this program would be a great new thing you could add to the Mac."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And there was also internet connectivity at the time for the iMac."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And so they did that and then they're trying to do these hookups."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "They weren't going well."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And that's when they said, we need to build our own."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Or Steve said, we need to build our own since these are such horrible experiences."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "People don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "We need to get that music on the go, but in an Apple fashion."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "That's when I was called to come in to do that, the iPod thing after the six weeks."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "Then he already envisioned, I'm sure he had it envisioned because they were trying to do this thing."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Okay, now that's it."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "iTunes, it wasn't called iPod yet."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "What would become the iPod?"}, {"time": 2673, "text": "That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple into this new thing because you're gonna bring all these music lovers in that are gonna need their next generation or Sony Walkman version 2.0."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod, but it's one of the great inventions in tech history."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "What wisdom do you draw from that whole process about spotting an idea?"}, {"time": 2703, "text": "This is something you talk about in your book, Build."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "How do you know that an idea is brilliant?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "At which stage?"}, {"time": 2712, "text": "When did you know it was a good idea?"}, {"time": 2716, "text": "And maybe is there like some phase shifts?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "First you complete out, then maybe, and then maybe it becomes more than a hmm and becomes like a little more confidence, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And also wisdom about who to talk to so they don't trample the idea in their early stages, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Any thoughts about this?"}, {"time": 2740, "text": "We could go on again."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "How long do you wanna go?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "20, this is a Netflix series, I told you."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "Multi season."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "So a lot of lessons learned over those years of failure and success, but the first thing it starts with, there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You."}, {"time": 2758, "text": "And so it kind of goes into in Build and it goes through kind of chapter and verse about all of those, how Nest became into being."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "But let's talk about it specifically for iPod, right?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "So for me, I always had pain, the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere, right?"}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And I had the joy of music, right?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "If you could say, all of a sudden I could get the music I love all the time in a portable package and I can have all the music I love all the time, I was solving a pain, which was, for me it was thousands of CDs, other people might be 10 or 15 CDs, right?"}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "And then at the end was a superpower, an emotional superpower that said, oh my, this is something different."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "So when you can actually focus on a pain, not and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "So the difference between a painkiller and a vitamin is very clear."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, maybe somebody needs it, maybe not, it's all marketing story, right?"}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller, and hopefully if you can do it in the right way, you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "That is always, and that's the way to know that you're hitting on something that's really powerful."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "The pain and the joy, are you always aware of the pain?"}, {"time": 2851, "text": "So it seems like a lot of great products, it's like we do a lot of painful things and we just kind of assume that's the way it's supposed to be, like with autonomous vehicles, we'll all assume we're supposed to be driving."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "And it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "Right, well, you've habituated it away."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "You've habituated it away."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "For me, when I go to other places, living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever, and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter or what have you, different thing, and you go, oh my God, when you left that environment, because everyone else is driving all the time, you're like, that's what you do."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "And you find out there's other ways of living and there's freedom when you get rid of that, you're like, oh my God, I didn't know that this was so much better."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "So there's something in the book that's called out and I deemed it the virus of doubt."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain and it's been habituated away, you use the right marketing messages to bring people back to that

those two cool things together as an engineer, you go, that's cool."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And then I would talk to the other friends who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that's cool."},

"It's not why?"}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Why are you doing this?"}, {"time": 3066, "text": "We know what we're doing, but we don't know why we're doing it, because we're not articulating it for

3079, "text": "So what normally happens, and this happens because we invest in so many companies around the world, you have these brilliant engineers, designers, scientists, researchers, they put together these what's."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And then they develop it, develop it, develop it."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "And then at the end, they call in marketing and say, now tell a story about this and let's get it out to the world, okay?"}, {"time": 3103, "text": "What happens then is marketing is like, well, why do people need this?"}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Tell us why people need it."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And so they create a story around this product, but the product was born out of what's, not why's."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story and it turns out to be a fictional story usually."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "They say, oh, this is going to do these things."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "The product comes in as

that script is then produced."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "And then you add all the flourishes and what have you music and graphics and what have you, right?"}, {"time": 3194, "text": "And then it comes

"text": "So you can actually look at that press release."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "You know, you change it over time, that draft."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But then when you're done, you know the what's and the whys."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "You have all the things, the audience and everything."}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And then you can give that to marketing and say, well, and marketing has been along the way, let's be clear."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "But then everybody's in sync."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "And that's when you can tell a cohesive, non fictional story about, and the product delivers on that story or hopefully over delivers on that story."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So in the drafting from the beginning to the end of the press release, what does a successful team look like?"}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Who's part of the draft?"}, {"time": 3291, "text": "Is it engineers, designers?"}, {"time": 3293, "text": "What's the purpose of a marketing department in a

questions."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "So, cause you're just like, I'm like, I can't wait to tell you the answer."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "So it's in the book as well, but you have to separate out the various functions of marketing."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "That's what I thought, I was like, marketing's marketing, and it's really not."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "There's so many disciplines,

and you have to honor that."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "And so there is marketing communications like PR, press, there is social marketing, there is a marketing creative, right?"}, {"time": 3360, "text": "There's marketing activation, but there's another thing that also comes out and people confuse it with marketing, which is called product marketing or product management."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And product management or product marketing is the voice of the customer."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "They're the person who sits there and listens to what's going on in the competition, in the marketplace, understanding the needs and those pains of the customer, and they're representing them in every single meeting so things don't get off track, right?"}, {"time": 3394, "text": "So that, and they're creating the messages, not the marketing."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "What happens is there's messages that product marketing creates, like those are the deep messages, like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "And then marketing turns that into something that's with creative and everything and brings that message across."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "Maybe it doesn't say that, but it comes maybe visually or some other way."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "So product management does that and holds that press release along the route and making sure that we're tracking."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And then also marketing is tracking with that press release to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Because they can also add extra adjectives or something, and then the product can't deliver that."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "It's like, no, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Keeps everybody in check."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "Right, to the customer needs, right?"}, {"time": 3444, "text": "Cause they're always representing the customer."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "So you have to have a product manager."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "Typically that's the founder, right?"}, {"time": 3450, "text": "In the beginning."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "And then over time you hire a product management team to then really watch over this the whole way."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "And they are talking to customer support."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "They're talking to engineering, they're talking to design, they're talking to sales and marketing."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "And they are always in the mix."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And it's the hardest thing to hire for."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "Ooh, yeah."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "So they have this very important job of developing and maintaining the why."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "Why is it the hardest to hire for?"}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Because you have to understand, first, nobody reports to you."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "You're alone."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "So you're alone and you have to build great ties with all of these different functions."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "You have to understand what they do, be empathetic with what they do."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "And you have to project the customer's empathy or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And so that they learn more."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "They're not just doing, but they learn about the customer's point of view and sit in there and stand in their shoes to be able to then make better decisions on the engineering details or the operational details, customer support details."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "So they understand that if they're not the customer that it's intended for, they start to live through their eyes and see through their eyes of that customer so they make better decisions."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions between that and sort of the engineers."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "Oh, that's cool."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "Sort of the developing the what."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "Which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question on the one subfield of marketing you mentioned, comms and PR."}, {"time": 3562,

communications is to provide caution."}, {"time": 3598, "text": "It almost works together with legal to say."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "A shield."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "Yeah, we probably should not say this."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "Let's be careful, let's be careful."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "Now, that makes sense except in this modern world, authenticity is extremely valuable and revealing the beauty that is in the engineering, the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas, I think requires throwing caution to the wind to some degree."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "And I just find that, boy, to push back on myself, I think it's an extremely difficult job because people hold you responsible if you're doing communications when you take risks."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And especially when they fail."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "So it's a difficult job, so I understand why people become cautious, but to me, communications is about taking big risks and throwing caution to the wind at its best because your job is to communicate in the long term, communicate the genius, the joy, the genius of the product."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And that sometimes is a tension with caution."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "Sorry, so because I've gotten the chance to meet a lot of very interesting people and interesting engineering teams and so on, I look at what they're doing and I look at what's being communicated and it's just, there's a mismatch because the communication is a lot more boring."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "It's like, there's something very like, just straight up boring about the way they're communicating because of caution."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "Okay, you have just teed me up for another diatribe, okay?"}, {"time": 3714, "text": "I'm gonna get on my podium here."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "Yeah, it all comes out of the leader."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "If the leader doesn't know how to storytell or the leader doesn't know how to do bold

have an even more conservative communications department."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "Because they wanna keep their jobs."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "Okay, it's really simple."}, {"time": 3760, "text":

even more conservative."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "If you have a bold leader, they'll always take a little more conservative bent, but you're still gonna have bold communications."}, {"time": 3777,

these leaders don't tell great stories."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm, is we take those scientists all of, and the great minds and everything, and what

of debt."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "We paid off our debt."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "It was a joyous moment for him, right?"}, {"time": 6822, "text": "And then ultimately for our team because no more debt, wonderful, right?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "So now what you have is you have this successful thing changing the face of Apple and you hear these heavy stomping footsteps of the mobile phone

need music so they can come to the iTunes music store and get that music for those phones because it wasn't just about the hardware player at that point."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "It was about the software that you need on the desktop and the content that you needed to download."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool as Steve would always refer to it."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "So now the mobile phone industry, okay, we're gonna work with them."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically inside of a phone, can have 99 songs

"text": "And he literally threw that phone out of his hand as fast as he could, right?"}, {"time": 6997, "text": "Cause it was horrible."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "So there was the pain of we're not gonna partner."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "So if we can't partner with these guys, we have to become one of them to actually compete, to save the thing that is bringing Apple from that 15 years of malaise, right?"}, {"time": 7014, "text": "So then from that, we were made a prototype of an iPod plus phone, a classic with it was an iPod, but it had a phone inside with all the music and all the other stuff."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "And you use your headset, wired headset to do the audio, right?"}, {"time": 7032, "text": "There was another project at the same time cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store, iTunes video store for music videos and movies."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "And it would be a full screen iPod."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "So instead of the classic, the way

{"time": 7058, "text": "Think of maybe an iPhone, like you knew it, right?"}, {"time": 7061, "text": "And then there was a third project going on, not in, those two were going on in my team, but the third project going on was the multi touchscreen technology to drive a Mac tablet."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology, there was just way too much you had to change on the software and everything to be able to use a tablet, right?"}, {"time": 7086, "text": "We see this all the time."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "Like people are like, there's not enough tablet apps today that are modified for tablet."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?"}, {"time": 7092, "text": "So then they would just be Mac touch stuff."}, {"time": 7095, "text": "So you'd have to have a whole developer community."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "That probably wasn't the best place to take that technology first."}, {"time": 7101, "text": "So you take that technology, marry it with the full screen, that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod and the phone stuff we were working because the iPod phone with a rotary dial was just like a rotary phone."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "We couldn't make that interface work well for data input."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "You put those three together."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And now is where those three things that then created the form or the technology and the form inside what would become the iPhone, married with a bunch of low level software from the iPod and manufacturing software and drivers and communication stuff, combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "And I mean that in the best way."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little."}, {"time": 7149, "text": "It was totally, things were hacked out and changed and new code was inserted."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And it really was a whole set of things from all different places to make that first iPhone OS."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "And then there was another team working on the apps and then another team working on the design of how it looked overall between all that stuff."}, {"time": 7167, "text": "So all of those things came together to create what we know as the first generation iPhone."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And those are all probably fascinating engineering challenges."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And great teams like creating the Frankenstein OS."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "That's fascinating because you're simplifying and simplifying but then you're just pulling different stuff from, and you're basically inventing, I mean, they're probably not thinking of it that way, but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer."}, {"time": 7196, "text": "It really is Frankenstein."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Right, and you didn't have to run Mac software."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time, like Windows and stuff, they were like, we need to make sure it runs Excel and it runs Word or something like that in some reduced thing."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "This was like, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "This was born out of entertainment."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "So we didn't have to go and take all the same application, you know, all those other ones was about compatibility."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "This was about a whole new way of being."}, {"time": 7221, "text": "What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation of the iPhone, the sort of, the first iPhone, you know."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "Phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "Yeah, that you're going to sort of present, announcing three new products kind of thing and then saying that it's all in one."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "Just, this is a good example, one of the sort of historic presentations of a product."}, {"time": 7252, "text": "Clearly there's like some showmanship that works, some reason it works."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work, but it did in this case, it often did for Steve."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "What, like, how did that feel?"}, {"time": 7266, "text": "What part of the actually the design process was that presentation?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "In the early, because you said, should consider the why, the press release at the very beginning."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "Steve was doing that the entire time."}, {"time": 7281, "text": "He was working on that story from day one."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "And then he would look at our faces because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't, at least if you're working for him, wouldn't tell him what you really thought of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence outside of the organization."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "And see what they thought, right?"}, {"time": 7305, "text": "And they could give him feedback on it and they could really challenge him, but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And so when you see that, hmm, then he would modulate it and change it slightly and change it."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "So he was working during all of that time on the story and the storytelling, right?"}, {"time": 7321, "text": "And the whys, while we're working on that and helping us refine it, just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?"}, {"time": 7328, "text": "All the time working on that."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "So when he comes out on stage, he does something that every marketer is told not to do."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "Say these three things are now combined in one."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form of storytelling possible for marketing, right?"}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But it was the best one because it was all those pains."}, {"time": 7351, "text": "It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications and I want my internet browsing because I want it on the go so I can look up things because it was information."}, {"time": 7360, "text": "And when you were on the road, you had a laptop, you had an iPod and you had a phone that, and you had to carry all of these things with you at once."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "Now we're gonna solve that pain for you and put it all together."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "So he was just showing you the pain and beating that virus of doubt and going, it's now in this one magical thing."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "And he could come up and masterfully tell that story because he told it almost every day to all of these people inside very quietly."}, {"time": 7386, "text": "And then it was just, right?"}, {"time": 7389, "text": "It was like a Tony award winning play that had been worked on for 10 years."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "But also the human came through, the timing."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "It was all that, it was all of it."}, {"time": 7398, "text": "And of course he was dramatic at certain points and he would raise his voice and a wry smile or whatever it was."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "Right, that wry smile was magic."}, {"time": 7405, "text": "It was all those touches."}, {"time": 7406, "text": "He was an actor as well as a storyteller."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "But it was the truth, right?"}, {"time": 7412, "text": "The truth came through."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "It was a nonfiction story."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it for dramatic effect."},

things."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "But watching the design process of really, cause it was really a team that was about materials."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "It was about form."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "It was about colors."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "It was about these physical characteristics."}, {"time": 7476, "text": "When we talked about this earlier was design."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "What is design?"}, {"time": 7479, "text": "Design's everywhere, okay?"}, {"time": 7481, "text": "So what they were really focused on was form, how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics, the physical aesthetics."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And watching, going through that process, I learned so much in that process about how to do colors, how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves, and shadows, and how it would look, not just in your hand, but how it would look in the photograph you were gonna take for marketing, right?"}, {"time": 7514, "text": "So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it."}, {"time": 7519, "text": "It was all of those physical things around that and watching the process to get there, that was enlightening for me, right?"}, {"time": 7531, "text": "It opened my mind to go, oh, okay."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "Just like there's a process for all these other things, it wasn't just magic and you say, ha, ha, ha, there it is."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "It was really a process of refinement, you know, of opening the funnel at the beginning and refining down over time to get to that final, the final and selecting and doing the selection."}, {"time": 7553, "text": "And certain types you could, certain times there were opinion based design details."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "But a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs of what can we deliver in volume?"}, {"time": 7565, "text": "What can we do different things?"}, {"time": 7566, "text": "So you always had these constraints that you had to work with under."}, {"time": 7569, "text": "And sometimes they, and the team, not just I, would say, we need this."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "And we're like, we can't deliver that."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "But maybe we were able to work together to find different design characteristics and different implementation characteristics that could get to that point without what they were describing."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "And instead of yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, let's find some other way to solve the problem together."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "Yeah, is, and I've seen this in several companies I've more closely interacted with, like Tesla is an example."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "Sometimes, you know, talking about curves, sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side to deliver a very specific kind of thing."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "And one question that comes up in my mind is like, well, how far should we go to try to deliver a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature, or in like whatever the form factor is, or the color of the material, when the cost is like 10X to deliver, not financially, but just like in effort, like how many problems to have to solve."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "Right, exactly, but you have to understand again the why behind it."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "And at Nest, when we had limited resources, you know, putting a screwdriver in the box, a custom designed screwdriver in the box, was born out of those experiences I had at Apple, and seeing how you can create something that's emotional, it's part of marketing, and it's part of the product experience overall, even though it seems extraneous."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "I went back and made the design team, and the mechanical team change some curves on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "And I said, they're saying these cost more, I said, it doesn't look right."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "There is a, but they're like, oh, well we had, I said, no, you're gonna go back, and you're gonna make that change, I told you we needed to do it, we had a better looking model, that is gonna get done, I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you, but we already had this discussion, and that's the way it's gonna have to be, and I'm sorry, but it is what it is."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "And you know, because it's better for the customer, and it looks better in the pictures, and all the other stuff."}, {"time": 7740, "text": "And then we did it, and it was great, and everyone agreed it was great at the end, but it was pain to get there."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "Those are where, those little details are where the magic comes out, right?"}, {"time": 7751, "text": "And if you don't do, if you don't take those pains and put in the love, the customer's gonna feel, it's gonna, they're either gonna feel the pain, or they're gonna feel the love, if you put it in, right?"}, {"time": 7763,

after all, is there something you've learned from sort of the tensions that are natural, or that happen in teams when they're passionate, and they're trying to solve these problems?"}, {"time": 7785,

without ups and downs is no fun."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "It's the journey, it's the journey that brings, it brings out the best in everyone."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life is Nest, Nest thermostats, and the big umbrella of Nest."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three, what was the most memorable, the most painful, the most insight leading challenge you had to overcome to bring Nest to life?"}, {"time": 7884, "text": "Well, the first thing for me was making someone care about their thermostat."}, {"time": 7897, "text": "No one considers it."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "They never had any customer choice."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "They didn't install it."}, {"time": 7903, "text": "They usually don't even use it, because it's so complicated, or what have you, they just, they bitch at it, they hide it in the corner, and then they just pay the bill, right, of whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 7914, "text": "It's totally unloved, unconsidered, right?"}, {"time": 7918, "text": "So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt, how do you wake that up and get people going, remember every day when you go in and it's like, you're just frustrated, and then you get the bill and you pay the bill, so you have to do that."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "So that was one thing."}, {"time": 7930, "text": "I think the other big one was not delivering, all of it was hard, right?"}, {"time": 7934, "text": "It was constrained, we had only so much stuff, we were bootstrapped, we didn't have massive funding, we didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars, but we did it for the right reasons."}, {"time": 7942, "text": "But I think the other big part of it was not just building a disruptive product, because a lot of the people on the team had done that, we knew what we were doing, and that was, if we got the design right, we could deliver it with enough time."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "It was getting the disruptive go to market, in other words, how to take that product from the end of the production line and get it into the customer's hands, because there was no retail or customer choice in thermostats."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "No one even, it was never considered purchase."}, {"time": 7977, "text": "They never thought they had choice."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack, told them, looked around, looked at their house and said, this looks like somebody who's got, is well to do."}, {"time": 7989, "text": "This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350, thank you very much."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "And you're like, I'll take whatever you give me, right?"}, {"time": 7997, "text": "And then it goes into another house, it's worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?"}, {"time": 8001, "text": "So there was no price transparency, there was no choice, you just got what you were given."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry, that's why there was no innovation in it, because it was doing just fine because every house needed them."}, {"time": 8017, "text": "All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers, by bonuses to say, you're gonna only carry our product, and if you sell this many, you're gonna get a free trip to Hawaii, right?"}, {"time": 8033, "text": "And for these guys who install, I get a free trip to Hawaii, that's dream for them, right?"}, {"time": 8037, "text": "So this whole channel was fully controlled by the product guys, and it was almost monopolistic in a way."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "So how do you go around that?"}, {"time": 8046, "text": "So creating a disruptive go to market channel, one was direct to consumer, right?"}, {"time": 8053, "text": "And all the marketing that was necessary to get that message across."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "Another one was getting the installation right."}, {"time": 8061, "text": "No one was self installing thermostats."}, {"time": 8064, "text": "So how do we get enough people who are early adopters to be able to self install them confidently?"}, {"time": 8070, "text": "So they didn't still have to call the guy to come and install it, because then he would say, this is a crap product."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "No, I got the most better product, right?"}, {"time": 8078, "text": "So you had to get rid of that friction."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "And then ultimately, how do you get the people who were not just early adopters, but people who needed to see it and touch it before they bought it?"}, {"time": 8087, "text": "How do you get that into retail when the large brands of the time of thermostats and Home Depot and Lowe's had contracts that they couldn't bring in any other brands?"}, {"time": 8098, "text": "They were owning the channel all the way to where there was any sort of slight customer choice."}, {"time": 8104, "text": "And it was really contractor choice more than it was in consumer choice."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "So all of that had to be innovated along with the product."}, {"time": 8113, "text": "And so to me, that was a huge challenge and something I had never done, most of us had never done."}, {"time": 8118, "text": "And we had to create, that was as much as a project as actually delivering the product itself."}, {"time": 8125,

needs a special mechanism to slow down enough to land on aircraft carrier."}, {"time": 921, "text": "And so it made it very maneuverable."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And what that leads to a lot of times is the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight, which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn, you're gonna bleed a lot of your energy away and be more susceptible for follow on

1892, "text": "And the whole time we were doing one of these to try to get the gear down."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back to try to get the gear out with the stick."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And it came down, it came down halfway there, just on its own."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So it came back around and we did like a safety trap in case there was a problem with the gear."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And that was my first flight, you know, a little bit of serendipity, but I'm gonna fast forward a bit."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "And I went back to that squad as an instructor about five or six years later, and I was an aviation safety officer at this point, which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And a student went in and he went in the back seat of a form flight, just like the one I went on."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight."}, {"time": 1940,

maintain formation?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "How stressful is that?"}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Because we're doing that when we drive, staying in lane."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it, it becomes somewhat, it's still stressful."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "Which actually is surprisingly stressful."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "When you look at lane

if I'm flying off a flight lead over here, what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying, or like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying, I'll start to notice that he's having a harder

they'll realize, and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs because they realize they've been locked up and their formation flying will get a lot better."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "And so, there's a lot of stress associated with that."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "There's some interesting psychological or visual issues such as vertigo as you're flying."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "So if you're flying with him and then you fly right into a cloud, right?"}, {"time": 2378, "text": "That's when it's very stressful because you have to be very close in order to maintain visual and you

that."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "You might not even be able to see that turn."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "And so all of a sudden you might look while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and

we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "We fly in one particular position so that all of the flight crew can look down the line and see the flight lead."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So everything has based, everything has to do with the two air crew visually maintaining sight of each other and

nothing's there."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So as I'm looking into automating this process, I thought, well, sure it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft to fly in formation off each other, right?"},

a much more interesting regime of operations and flight mechanics."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic mindset where we can bring in aircraft close to do some type of normal flying or reduce congestion around airports."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "But when we consider flying or formation in a tactical environment, we can be much more effective with nontraditional formation keeping or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "So autonomy used for formation keeping, not for convenience, but for the introduction of randomness."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Like to a real time mission planner, yeah."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And then that's where you also have some human modification."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "So it's like unmanned teaming enters that picture."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "So you use some of the human intuition and adjustment of this formation."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "The formation itself has some uncertainty."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I mean, it's such an interesting dance."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "I think that is the most fascinating application of artificial intelligence is when it's

and going in the woods and science fiction and all that."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "And so, what seemed to kind of drive me towards that was just a desire to really be operating as close to what I

particular cases, you're usually lined up behind the boat, maybe 10, 15 miles, whereas the other ones, it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "And so we can

you almost kind of have to snap back to it and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like look around a little bit and engage my brain, link it back to my body and like do this thing."}, {"time": 3575,

maintenance on the aircraft."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And our particular model of the F18, the lot number, was plumbed for the particular things that were needed to upgrade the radar from what's

of a magnitude jump in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So it's a leap to digital."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "ABG 73, so I mean, are these things on a carrier?"}, {"time": 3806, "text": "Like what are we talking about here?"}, {"time": 3808, "text": "How big is the radar?"}, {"time": 3809, "text": "So this is actually the radars in the F18 itself."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "Okay, so when you say they were chosen, this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG 79."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "Less of a test and more of just, hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "Like we're all going to these better radars."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "They were building ones off the line with the new radar, but we were this weird transitionary squadron in the middle that transitioned from the older ones to the new ones."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "But it's not particularly rare to fly with different types of radar because in the, and we call the fleet replacement squadron, essentially the training ground for the F18, you have all sorts of F18s with different radar."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "So you are used to having multiple ones, but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects on the radar that we were seeing the next day with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And these were sometimes the same day."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "You might go on two flights."},

should be yet, or perhaps there's some other type of error."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "It was relatively new and we were somewhat used to there being software problems with these types of things occasionally, just like anything else."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "We're getting some false tracks, as we call them."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "What were you seeing?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "And so what we would see are representations of the objects."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "So this is off of our radar."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "We're not seeing a visual image here."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "This is kind of like what's being displayed to us almost like in a gaming fashion, right?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "Like the icon, right?"}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And here's the parameters I can understand about it."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "So this is in the cockpit."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "There's a display that's showing some visualization with the radars detecting."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "And there's two different ways to do that."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "The first one is like the actual data, like the radar where I am, it's showing me the data kind of as if it's in front of me and I'm selecting those contacts."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "And there's another screen called the situational awareness page."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And that's kind of a God's eye view that brings all that data into one spot."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "And so I'm gonna talk about this from the SA page, from the situational awareness page versus the individual radar ones, because it's easier, but."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Can you, sorry to linger on that."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "So the individual displays are like first person and then SA is, when you say God's eye view, it's like from the top, the integration of all that information as if it's looking down onto the earth."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "Is that a good way to summarize it?"}, {"time": 3973, "text": "It is, but for the aviator, it's slightly different because those two radar displays I talked about are at the bottom of that display is kind of representative of where I am."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "And so I see what's in front of me."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "Whereas the situational awareness page, the aircraft is located in the center of that."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "And then all around me, based off of the data link and wherever I'm getting information from, I can see that whole awareness page."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "I can see all the situation."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So I'm gonna kind of talk about this from the situational awareness page, which is a top down view, just to kind of frame our minds instead of jumping around."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "And so what we would see out there is we'd see these indications that something would be there and they would have a track file."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "That track file, that thing that represents the object has a line coming out of it."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "And that represents, it's called the target aspect indicator."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "So there's some tracking from the radar."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "Correct, so it's showing you where the object's going."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "So radar locks in on different objects and it tracks them over time."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "That's coming from the radar."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "That's like a built in feature."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "So out there we're seeing it."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "We don't have to necessarily pull things into our tracker in some sense, right?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "It's all out there and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff or to kind of focus in on it more so."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "But the information should all be out there."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "And so we'd see that that target aspect indicator, that line on a typical aircraft, it would kind of look like this."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "It would be coming out and it would go steady and if they turned, it would be like boop, boop, boop, and you see them turn, right?"}, {"time": 4061, "text": "It's not magic."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "But this object, the target aspect would kind of be like all over the place, like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees from that top down view, that line would be in any place."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "So kind of, is it unable to determine the target aspect?"}, {"time": 4076, "text": "Is it stationary?"}, {"time": 4078, "text": "And that's just how it puts it out and it's not used to seeing it."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird, but it was different than what we were used to seeing because we weren't used to seeing stationary objects out there very much."}, {"time": 4088, "text": "And what was also interesting is that these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?"}, {"time": 4093, "text": "These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet, 500 feet with the wind blowing, you know?"}, {"time": 4101, "text": "And so much like the sea, when we're up there fighting, it affects everything."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "We consider the wind when we're shooting missiles, when we're flying or fuel considerations, it's like operating in that volume of air, like the ocean, everything's going with the current."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And so anything that doesn't go with the current is immediately kind of identifiable and strange and that's why these were initially strangers because they would be stationary against the wind."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "So if you had something like a good drone in a windy conditions, what would that look like?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "Would it not come off as stationary?"}, {"time": 4130, "text": "Would it sort of float about kind of thing?"}, {"time": 4133, "text": "No, I think with the drone technology we have today, they could stay within a pretty tight location."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "Well, I meant like DJI drone, I'm saying like generically speaking, not a military drone."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "No, I have a DJI drone myself even, and you know, maybe not a hundred knots, but if that thing's in 30 or 40 and not winds, the amount of distance it's going to be kind of doing one of these, like that change is not something I'm gonna detect from maybe many miles away."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "So it could look very stationary, but that wasn't necessarily, and what's interesting about this story is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?"}, {"time": 4168, "text": "You have to kind of look at everything."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "And that's what I don't like about the Department of Defense and just generally people's take on this is that everything is kind of based around a single image, you know, or that one case, but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration or the time it's been out there, how they're interacting relative to other objects out there."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "And you don't get that information when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?"}, {"time": 4192, "text": "Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "So you yourself, from your particular slice of things you've experienced and seen directly or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition about what are the things that were being seen."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "I wouldn't go that far."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "I've just been able to eliminate some variables because of how long I've observed it."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "So like you said, yes, can a drone stay in a particular position against the wind like that?"}, {"time": 4216, "text": "Certainly, but I don't think it can do that and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?"}, {"time": 4221, "text": "And so when you look at outside of that one, that moment in time, then it eliminates a lot of the potential things it could be, at least from my perspective."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?"}, {"time": 4233, "text": "We'd see them flying in patterns, kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns or just going kind of straight east."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach, but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach, just for extremely extended periods of time, essentially all the time."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And this is airspace where there's not supposed to be anything else at all."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And it's pretty far out there."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles."}, {"time": 4261, "text": "Can you say the location that we're talking about?"}, {"time": 4263, "text": "Off the coast of Virginia Beach."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Got it, and so nobody's supposed to be out there?"}, {"time": 4269, "text": "It's possible for people to be there."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "It's not necessarily restricted, but it's well monitored and we're out there every day, all day."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And so people know to stay clear."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "If a Cessna goes bumbling in there, everyone's gonna know about it."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "FAA is gonna call them out, gonna tell us about it."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "So incursions happen, not a big deal, but they're pretty rare, honestly, because everyone knows the area and we've been operating there for decades."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach that these objects were taking?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds, or I just see them kind of, and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot is gonna be just very precise, right?"}, {"time": 4314, "text": "It's gonna be locked on straight."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "Whereas I could see an airplane, I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right?"}, {"time": 4319, "text": "Because it's not gonna be perfect."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "The computer's not controlling it."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And these seemed more like that."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "Not that they were imprecise, but that they were even much more erratic than that."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "So like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "It was just kind of like a weird drift like that in that direction."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "So it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer, or not disrespect to computers."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "So it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "That's not the sense that I got."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So how many people have seen them in the squadron?"}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Sort of how many times were they seen?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "How many were there times when there's multiple objects?"}, {"time": 4356, "text": "Once we started seeing them on the radar enough, and we would get close enough, we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So our advanced targeting pod."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "It's essentially a infrared camera that we use for targeting, mostly in the air to surface environment."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "We don't use it in the air to air arena."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "It's just not that good of a tool, frankly."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "But we would see IR energy emitting from that location where the radar was dropping us off."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "So the radar, we'd lock onto the object and our sensors would all look there."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And so then we could see that it's looking at that right piece of sky, but there's energy actually coming from there."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "So now we started thinking that, okay, maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more, maybe something is physically here, of course."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "And then people started to try to fly by it and see it."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "And at this point, I would say maybe 80 to 90% of our squadron had probably seen one of these on the radar at this point."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Everyone was aware of it."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "There was small communication, I think, between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "So I knew it wasn't just our squadron for whatever strange reason, because other squadrons would be out there and we would talk to them, like, hey, careful, there's an object."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So they would be aware of it."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And then, of course, people would want to go see what they look like, right?"}, {"time": 4425, "text": "So people would try to fly by it."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "I try to

of perspective that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don't."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "But perhaps that's part of the reason you want to fly by it, is to understand better what it is if it's a threat."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "We have a lot of context now that we didn't back then."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So it was still, hey, is this a balloon?"}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Is this a

one."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "Now you have FLIR images that can give you a sense that that's actually a physical object."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "What else can be said about those physical

just describing a geometric object?"}, {"time": 4671, "text": "It's not on radar so it's unclear what it is."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "Yeah, what was the, any kind of other description they've had of it in terms of the intuition from a pilot's perspective?"}, {"time": 4683, "text": "You have to kind of identify what a thing is."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "To answer the first part, they actually

better radar."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So they came back and they're in their gear and they're talking to the front desk and talking to Skipper and like, hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "And this kind of was one of those kind of slight watershed moments where we all were kind of like, all right, like this is a serious deal now."}, {"time": 4712,

these things, then we need to take care of the situation."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "And that's actually when we started submitting hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval Aviation Safety kind of

that you can kind of share that aggregate data and make sure that things are progressing."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "So it wasn't a mechanism that would result in action being taken, but we were

not just say Russia or China and just call them the bad guys and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,

fighter pilots, at least on East Coast."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "But that's great that they can talk about it, right?"}, {"time": 5741, "text": "They feel at least comfortable."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "They have a reporting mechanism."}, {"time": 5743, "text": "And so that was one of the problems that I noticed that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms to take care of safety issues and

the different UFO sightings that the DOD has released videos on."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO that David Fravor and others have sighted?"}, {"time": 5786,

as much as I try, right?"}, {"time": 5800, "text": "Just as a logical process, as a practice, I can't pick it apart in the way that we were just talking about a moment ago about thousands of drones

anything he says."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Yeah, I agree with you, but in terms of the actual UFO, is there something anomalous and interesting to you about that particular case?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "Maybe one interesting aspect there is how much do I understand about the water surface and underwater aspects of these UFOs?"}, {"time": 5850, "text": "It seems like a lot of the discussions is about the movement of this particular thing that seems to be weird, anomalous, seems to defy physics, but what about stuff that's happening underwater?"}, {"time": 5862, "text": "That's interesting to me."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "If I had advanced technology, I would certainly like to operate in part underwater because you can hide a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "You think it would be somewhat as easy as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?"}, {"time": 5876, "text": "You know, I wish I had a great answer for that, but as an aviator, that's kind of a black box for us."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "We don't have great, what I would call cross domain tracking, right?"}, {"time": 5888, "text": "I can't see something go underwater and then follow it underwater."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "So it's literally not your domain, like underwater, like leave that for somebody else."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "Yeah, and you know, I use that terminology because it's kind of important, right?"}, {"time": 5900, "text": "Cross domain tracking is something that we haven't had to necessarily worry about, right?"}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Because airplanes operated in the air and submarines operated underwater and space planes operate in space, right?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "But you know, there's going to be, you know, that's going to blur, I think, as we move along here, especially in the air and space regime and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact at 40,000 feet to another radar system that can track it up to 200,000 feet, you know, that might be a value."}, {"time": 5928, "text": "And so we seem to be missing that right now."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "So what about the go fast and the gimbal videos that you mentioned earlier?"}, {"time": 5934, "text": "There was a, like, what's interesting there to you?"}, {"time": 5938, "text": "So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "I was airborne for that one."}, {"time": 5942, "text": "The person that recorded it was a good friend of mine, but I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them, but the wizard himself, very close friends,

was instructing."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "And, you know, the way that was, was we went out on a air to air training mission."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "So simulating a air fight against our own guys, they're acting like the bad guys and kind of go head to head against each other."}, {"time": 5976, "text": "And when

workup training event."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "And so this is like a month on the boat where we're essentially conducting war time operations, more or less, to stress ourselves out and to kind of do the last training block before we go on deployment, essentially."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "So it's pretty high stress."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "They actually do send aircraft from like land bases to kind of try to penetrate and we're expected to go intercept them."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "And so we're kind of practicing like we play."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "And so he saw these objects on the radar, the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "And they initially thought it was part of the training exercise that they were sending something in to try to penetrate the airspace."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "And so they, you know, they flew over to it and as they got close enough to get on the FLIR, you know, I think everyone has heard their reaction and they realized that it wasn't something they were expecting to see."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "Can you actually describe what's in the video and what's the reaction in case they haven't seen it?"}, {"time": 6049, "text": "Yeah, a lot of swearing."}, {"time": 6051, "text": "But so what you see on the FLIR footage is a black or white, depending on when you look at it, object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "It appears almost as if someone put two plates together and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel of IR energy that's at the top of the bottom of those plates in a sense."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "So almost as if, you know, there's a stick going in between two plates, but not that pronounced, right?"}, {"time": 6074, "text": "So there's an energy field that kind of went to a funnel on the top and the bottom, at least that's how it's being portrayed on the FLIR."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "There's a lot of conversation about that being glare, things of that nature, but it was actually a very tight IR image."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft, we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust, especially at those ranges."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "But...

6105, "text": "It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it that was stationary in the sky."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?"}, {"time": 6113, "text": "It wasn't falling out of the sky."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "And it continued along, if we were to consider it from a God's eye view, again, on the SA page, it continued along in a path."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "And from the perspective, that top down view, it just went in another direction."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "So no, just an instantaneous direction change from that perspective."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "You also hear them, you know, very excitedly talking on the tapes about, you know, whatever the heck this thing is and look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "And so the SA is a situational awareness page."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "And again, it's a large display that gives that God's eye view of all the radar contacts."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "So the video is actually showing just one and then they're speaking about many of them on the SA display."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "And what they essentially saw was, if we were to consider above the object north, so kind of offset to the north of the object, there was a formation of about somewhere between four and six of these objects in a rough wedge formation, you know, so kind of side by side like this."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And again, not in a like autopilot type manner where it was very stiff."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "It was very kind of non mechanical, the flight mechanics again."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "And these objects were in that formation and they were going along and then they turned pretty sharply, but they still had a radius of turn and then went back in the opposite direction."}, {"time": 6191, "text": "And during that turn, they were kind of like all over the place."}, {"time": 6194, "text": "Like it wasn't tight."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "They weren't even like super, they weren't flying in a way I would expect them to be flying in relation to a flight lead."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "They were flying as if they were flying close to each other, but not in formation, which was kind of strange, right?"}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And then when they rolled out, they kind of tightened back up."},

formation."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "And while that was happening, the gimbal object was proceeding, let's say left to right."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north and was just passing back it, the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "So to follow it back in that direction."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "And in the FLIR itself, you see the object changes orientation quite a bit."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "So you see it more or less level, maybe candid about 45 degrees."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "And then you see it kind of moving around like this, almost as if it was a gimbal."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I've come to learn after some, having seen some research online and people really looking into this, that it seemed that the object actually climbed during that maneuver."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately is because it turned like this."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "It turned in a vertical fashion like that, which is pretty interesting."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics that we don't normally operate because we don't change our directions by maneuvering in the vertical."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "If we can help it, you're just killing the fuel."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "And so if

we weren't putting our sensors on them that much."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "We were gathering the data kind of secondarily, but we weren't primarily focusing on it to see all the details."}, {"time":

there."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "We're just not gonna go there."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "And that says something about human nature, about the way that bureaucracies function, the way the military functions."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "It fills up your day with busy, important things, and you don't get to, I mean, that is something that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about, which is like we

our busy schedule."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "Beautiful, I think that's right on the nose."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "And it's on my nose because I didn't give this topic the attention it deserved

get out of exactly what you just described."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "And that's kind of what broke me out of it and got me thinking more about it."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "Why do you think the DOD released these videos?"}, {"time": 6396, "text": "Did the DOD release it or did they kind of get out on their own in some sense?"}, {"time": 6399, "text": "So I don't know the answer to that question,

have just straight up lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "But again, I think our culture now is too open and the information moves too freely to do things like that."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And it kind of left them in a pickle that they had to respond to."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "So what was the role of Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence

aviator that never would have exposed me to anything like that."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "But I was curious about what people knew."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "And I think in my mind, maybe you hoped or, hope someone was looking into this in some sense."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "But on the day that Gimbal was recorded, I heard that they caught something extra interesting on the FLIR, and I went to the Intel debrief space to go see the film."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "And everyone's gathered around watching it, very interesting, and I heard the admiral was coming down."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "And so I was like, I'm gonna hang out back quietly, mind my own business, and just wanna see his reaction, try to read it to see if this is brand new or if it is something that they've been dealing with."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And you know, he came in and he watched a video for like five or six seconds, and he went, mm, and then like turned around and walked out."}, {"time": 6481,

essentially reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time, essentially, after he left, right?"}, {"time": 6503, "text": "So he basically went back and I was told he reported that to either ATEP directly or to other, you know, somehow the information got there."}, {"time": 6510, "text": "So from my perspective and from what I've experienced, it seems like, yes, it was a thing."},

like there's somewhere to report to."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "At the time, it seemed like there was at least someplace to complain to, if not report to."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking a serious look at the videos and just the different UFO sighting reports."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "So there's a person named Meg West who is a skeptic and tries to take a skeptical view on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings."}, {"time": 6548, "text": "What do you think about his analysis?"}, {"time": 6551, "text": "He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these videos and assign probabilities to their explanations, sort of leaning towards things that give a very low probability to alien extraterrestrial type of explanations for these UFOs."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "What do you think about his approach to these analysis?"}, {"time": 6575, "text": "Well, two parts to his approach."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "One, I commend him for all the good work and effort he put into it."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "I've seen him build some models and things of that nature."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed in this environment."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?"}, {"time": 6591, "text": "Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra."}, {"time": 6595, "text": "But where I have a disagreement with his approach is that he's approaching from a debunker standpoint."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "And from my perspective, not speaking for everyone, but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving towards a particular conclusion, which has been a very safe process for the past X years."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "It's been like a very safe business to be in to tell people that they haven't seen aliens, but times have changed a little bit."}, {"time": 6623, "text": "And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that view on reality has included things such as completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "And I think that is a fallacy to think that we have to take the human outside of that analysis."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So those are the two things I disagree with."}, {"time": 6645, "text": "When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars and you look out there in the vast cosmos, only a small fraction of which we can see, how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "You know, I'm of the theory that we are not the only people out there."}, {"time": 6664, "text": "I think it would be a statistically silly comment to assume we are, although I get that we are the only data point that we currently have."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "Although I'm willing to jump over that fence and say that yes, there most likely is intelligent life elsewhere."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Although I'll concede that it is a possibility we are early or it could be limited or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize or can really understand."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "I spend so much time thinking about how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "And we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "We've trained ourselves what to think about, what we think is true or what this would be like."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off to a lot of what the possibilities could be and the things that we could miss."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "You beautifully put that the thing that drew you to fighter jets is the technology."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So if you were to think, to imagine from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies would we first encounter as human beings if we were to meet another alien civilization in the next few centuries?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "What kind of thing would we see?"}, {"time": 6735, "text": "So you're now at the cutting edge and you see the quick progress that's happening."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "That was happening throughout the 20th century, that's happening now with greater degrees of autonomy with robots and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "What do you think we will encounter?"}, {"time": 6748, "text": "I think we're gonna see the ability to manipulate matter like we used to manipulate information."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "Like I think that's what, whether that means being able to pop something on the table that didn't exist or to influence a chemical reaction somewhere, but being able to manipulate and treat matter as if it was information."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "And so being able to design specific materials, being able to move past a lot of the barriers that seem to limit our progress with things such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general is a lot of it is matter based, is material based and our ability to not manipulate, we can only discover materials in a sense."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "And so I think that a complete mastery of physical reality would be one of the key traits of a very intelligent species."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "Well, you're actually working on some, maybe you can correct me, but sort of quantum mechanical simulation to understand materials."}, {"time": 6808, "text": "So is that, do you see sort of the early steps that we're doing at quantum computing side to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials, but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials at the very low level that aliens will be able to do and hopefully humans will be able to do soon?"}, {"time": 6826, "text": "Yeah, I think that's, you know, so if we think about how, what materials are made of, it's just a collection of atoms, but each one of those atoms has a lot of data associated with it."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "So if we wanna kind of calculate how they interact with each other, it requires a massive amount of computational resources, so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases with classical computers."}, {"time": 6846, "text": "And that's where quantum computers come in."}, {"time": 6849, "text": "Although we don't have a perfectly functioning quantum computer at this point, one of the things that we're working at at quantum general materials is to essentially bridge that gap between what a classical computer can do as far as simulating materials."}, {"time": 6861, "text": "And of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer would mean for being able to design materials."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "And so, you know, having the ability to study matter at a very fundamental level and unleashing artificial intelligence to machine learning on that problem, I think is, you know, in a sense, you know, alien in a way that we're able to advance our science using, you know, a process that we may not fully understand with perhaps a non human based intelligence in some sense."}, {"time": 6887, "text": "And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?"}, {"time": 6890, "text": "How does our machine learning output, you know, can we match behaviors with what we're observing with what may be a machine learning algorithm with output, right?"}, {"time": 6898, "text": "Can we try to classify the intelligence in that manner, perhaps?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "And so, you know, at GenMatt, as we're looking at these materials, we're considering what these algorithms could have used for later on."}, {"time": 6909,

putting humans in extreme conditions where we figure out how to make it less extreme, more comfortable."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "And for that, we invent things, like the DOD sort of helping invent

fighting for our survival in a sense."}, {"time": 8250, "text": "And so I think there's great power and strength and clarity perhaps in that, and it's not always born out of hate, but out of necessity, and we can't always control that."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "And I think as we focus on ourselves so much, we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves fighting for things that we need, and we're always taking from someone else at this point."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "And so as someone that's been in combat and very high above it, I'll say, right, where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger, I rationalized it and I made my way through it, knowing that there were people on the other side that were going to die that were on our side than not."}, {"time": 8292,

human versus human."}, {"time": 8307, "text": "There's some aspect of war that is basically one people fighting each other."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "I guess it's the kind of respect you have for the

there, not on the ground."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "So I understand that it's a bit more romantic than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground experiencing all the horrors down there, because

love and they're often brilliant people, one of the thoughts I have to deal with, one of the dragons in my own mind is, you know, thinking that I don't deserve that kind of attention."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "Well, you probably don't."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "But maybe you could."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "So it's a burden in that I have to step up to be the kind of person that deserves that, not deserves that, but in part deserves that kind of attention."}, {"time": 6839, "text": "And that's like, holy shit."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "It's crucially important too, because if someone

me."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "And so if I'm peevish or irritable, then well, that's not good."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "And so that's a tight rope to walk to because I do not like that creeping

narrative."}, {"time": 7194, "text": "Great, and great characterization, you know?"}, {"time": 7197, "text": "So, and there's a familiarity about Stephen King's writing too that it's, he writes about people you know."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And so I really found that a relief."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "And so that was useful."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "And that in order to tolerate this, let's say, or to be able to sustain it, well, let's take a lot of negotiation on the part of Tammy and I, because she's dragged into this and, you know, her life is part of this, whatever this is."},

be on the tour this spring, and I was ill again for part of it."}, {"time": 7237, "text": "And that made it complicated, but she went away back home and she came back and she said, and she was nervous about, she said, I think I need my own room."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "And part of me was not happy with that."}, {"time": 7247, "text": "It's like, what do you mean you need your, like, are we not married anymore?"}, {"time": 7250, "text": "It's like, you need your own room?"}, {"time": 7252, "text": "And she said, well, you know, I can't, she has to do exercises because she was really sick and

this in order to continue."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "And I thought, well, okay, if you need this in order to continue, yes."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "Because she went away and didn't say, well, I don't want to be on the tour."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "She went away and prayed, let's say, how can I continue to do this?"}, {"time": 7288, "text": "And that was the answer."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "And so she has her own hotel room."}, {"time": 7292, "text": "And that was a really good decision on her part."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "And she's very good and getting better all the time at figuring out what has to happen for her to make this sustainable."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "And all that's been is a plus because I don't want to travel without her."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And I don't want her life to be miserable."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "And I want her to be fully on board."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "And so she has to be properly selfish."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "Like everyone does in a relationship."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "And you have to, not just that, this is a weird thing that you're doing."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "And you have to, both you and her have to figure out how to manage this very intense intellectual, social journey."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Well, there's another element to it too that I didn't tell you about."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component because usually we also have a dinner with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose, 10 to 30 from each country."}, {"time": 7348,

that."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk, but sometimes the talks are back to back."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "And then people are showing us exciting things and tours in the cities and which is all, like it's a surf fight of wonderful."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "But

7384, "text": "How do you get to sleep?"}, {"time": 7387, "text": "Fortunately, that is almost never a problem."}, {"time": 7391, "text": "Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "I thought about that a lot too, you know, that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that while I was ill because it appeared in some sense that the reason I was ill was because I was taking benzodiazepines, but that isn't why I was ill. And then I took them and very low dose."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "And I took that for a long time and it helped whatever was wrong with me."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "And it looks like it was an allergy or maybe multiple allergies."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "And then that stopped working."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "And so I took a little bit more for about a month and that made it way worse."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "And so then I cut back a lot and then, then things really got out of hand."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "So there was a deeper thing in the Benzo."}, {"time": 7438,

Tammy has three immunological conditions, each of them quite serious."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis, which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared to be allergy related."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "And so Michaela seems to have got all of that."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of, cause I also had this proclivity to depression that was part of my family history."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "But I think that was all immunological as far as I can tell."}, {"time": 7475, "text": "So one of the things that's happened to me, I always noticed I really couldn't breathe."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "Like I could breathe about one fifth as much as I sometimes could."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "And so I was always short of breath."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "And it looks like what that was perhaps was I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction, which is not pleasant."}, {"time": 7498, "text": "And that's hypersympathetic activation, no parasympathetic activation."}, {"time": 7503, "text": "I couldn't relax at all."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "That's an immunological response."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "Allergic response, yeah."}, {"time": 7509, "text": "So anyways, that was what seemed, now this, I don't like to talk about this much cause it's so bloody radical and I don't like to propagate it, but this diet seems to have stopped all of that."}, {"time": 7519, "text": "I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone."}, {"time": 7522,

that I too am not a deep investigator of nutritional science."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "I have my skepticism towards the degree to which it is currently as a science."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery and full of profiteers, the people that profit of different kinds of diets."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "But I should say for me personally, it does seem that I feel by far the best when I eat only meat."}, {"time": 7567, "text": "And I discovered that a long time ago."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "First of all."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "How did you discover it?"}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So by, the discovery went like this."}, {"time": 7575, "text": "I started listening to ultra marathon runners about 15 years ago."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "And they started talking about fat adapted running."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast to enjoy running."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "So that was like step one."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "It's like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "If I maintain something called the math rule, which is the pretty low heart rate."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general."}, {"time": 7610,

"text": "So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but."}, {"time": 7628, "text": "Well, that's an optimization of death because you're, when you fast, your body, logically and obviously, if you think about it biologically is, well, what is your body scavenge first?"}, {"time": 7640, "text": "Well, damaged tissue."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "So the, and I know the literature on fasting to some degree, and it's very compelling literature."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too, below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "That's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%, yeah, 30%."}, {"time": 7663, "text": "Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things that make me nervous because I always feel like there's no free lunch that I'm gonna pay for it somehow."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "But there's a focus that I am able to attain when I fast, especially when I eat once a day."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "My mind is almost like nervously focused."}, {"time": 7681, "text": "It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one or one that I can channel into just like an excitement."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with, well, imagine that that signifies lack of food, which not that hard to imagine."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert in that situation, right?"}, {"time": 7699, "text": "Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode, let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And God only knows maybe human beings should be in hunting mode all the time."}, {"time": 7711, "text": "Often, but we don't know that."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "So I wonder if it has a stress on the system that long term causes the system to get sick."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "It doesn't look like it."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "It seems in the case of fasting, not."}, {"time": 7723, "text": "And then on top of that, I discovered that the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much."}, {"time": 7732, "text": "So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diet."}, {"time": 7735, "text": "So I just discovered through that process, if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat, I just feel a lot of the things that make me feel weird about food, like a little groggy or like full or just whatever, the aspects of food that I don't enjoy, they're not there with meat."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "And I'm still able to enjoy company."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "And when I eat once a day and eat meat, I said, at least in Texas, you could still have all the merriment of, you have dinner with friends."},

whiskey."}, {"time": 7781, "text": "I'll still do the things that add a little bit of spice into the thing."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "Now, when you completely remove the spice, it does become more difficult."}, {"time": 7792, "text": "Yeah, it's more difficult socially."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb, although she might be able to eat non aged beef."},

7867, "text": "There's a lot of things you could be bothered by."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "Like a million things, man."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "But some things grip you."}, {"time": 7873, "text": "They bug you."}, {"time": 7874, "text": "And they might make you resentful and bitter, because they bug you so much."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "Like, they're your things, man."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "They've got you."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "So then I look for a question that I would like the answer to, that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it, so I don't assume I already have the answer, because I would actually really like to have the answer."}, {"time": 7895, "text": "So if I could get a better answer, great."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "And so that's the first thing."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "And that's like a prayer."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "It's like, okay, here's a mystery."}, {"time": 7905, "text": "I would like to delve into it further."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "Well, so that's humility."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "It's like, here's a mystery, which means I don't know."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "I would like to delve into it further, which means

yourself a question, it's a real question."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "Do you get an answer or not?"}, {"time": 7930, "text": "And the answer is, well, yeah, thoughts start to appear in your head."},

exist."}, {"time": 8301, "text": "So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audio books."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "Actually, most of my friends are dead."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "The writers."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "The definition of a reader."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "It's a lot of dead, great dead friends."}, {"time": 8314, "text": "So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose, and have a conversation."}, {"time": 8319, "text": "And then there's this kind of puzzle that I've been longing to solve."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "The same reason I went to Ukraine of asking this question of myself, who am I?"}, {"time": 8330, "text": "And what was this part of the world?"}, {"time": 8332, "text": "What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?"}, {"time": 8336, "text": "That I lost so much of my family there and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place."}, {"time": 8343, "text": "Now that place includes the Soviet Union and it includes Russia and Ukraine."},

was forced onto them through different governmental institutions."}, {"time": 8372, "text": "And you are somebody that seemed from some angle to also be drawn to try to understand what was that."},

"In what way is it repeating again?"}, {"time": 8391, "text": "And how can we stop it?"}, {"time": 8394, "text": "That's the crucial issue."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds, pull at the thread of that curiosity."}, {"time": 8404, "text": "You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist, both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "And a talk with various levels of eloquence about sort of the shadows that these, that history casts on us."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "And so that was one."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "And also the psychology, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time."}, {"time": 8433, "text": "I was fascinated by the human mind until I discovered artificial intelligence, the fact that I could program and make a robot move."}, {"time": 8444, "text": "And until I discovered that magic, I thought I wanted to understand the human mind by being psychiatrist, by talking to people, by to talk therapy, psychotherapy."}, {"time": 8455, "text": "So now you've got the best of both worlds because you get to talk to people and you get build robots."}, {"time": 8459, "text": "Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "That I felt like by building the thing, can you start to try to understand it."}, {"time": 8469, "text": "I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities."}, {"time": 8472, "text": "So like my particular one is, has to do with, I learned by building."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "I think through a thing by building it."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "And programming is a wonderful thing because it allows you to like build a little toy example."}, {"time": 8490, "text": "So in the same way you can do a little thought experiment,

interest in Freud and Young, you're also in different ways, have delved deeply into humanity, the human psyche through the perspective of those psychologists."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "So for all those reasons, I thought our paths were crossed."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "Yeah, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?"}, {"time": 8527, "text": "You had all sorts of reasons, and then you think, well, are you just letting the conversation go where it will?"}, {"time": 8533, "text": "It's like, well, not exactly."}, {"time": 8535, "text": "You spent all this time, it's not like this came about by accident, this conversation, you spent all this time framing it."}, {"time": 8542, "text": "And so all of that provides the implicit substructure for the play in the conversation."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "And if you have that implicit, here's another way, this is very much worth knowing is, if you get the implicit structure of perception right, everything becomes a game."},

seriously."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "It's a serious business, right?"}, {"time": 8612, "text": "And that's part of that, to circle back to the beginning, let's say, that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss, which is obviously what you were doing when you went to Ukraine."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas, not as differentiated as it became, sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed towards the abyss, and then you're traumatized."}, {"time":

that idea about facing death and hell."}, {"time": 8654, "text": "It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?"}, {"time": 8658, "text": "And the answer is, this terrible answer is, yes, to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily."}, {"time": 8667, "text": "And then you might ask, well, why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I'm innocent."},

out?"}, {"time": 8740, "text": "You're a man who has suffered in this way."}, {"time": 8743, "text": "Perhaps continue to suffer in this way."}, {"time": 8746, "text": "How do you find a way out?"},

that?"}, {"time": 8760, "text": "So I have to find out like, because maybe they're not depressed, maybe they're hyper anxious, or maybe they're obsessional."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "Like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion."}, {"time": 8770, "text": "So they need to be differentiated."}, {"time": 8772, "text": "But then the next question you have to ask is, well, are you depressed?"}, {"time": 8776, "text": "Or do you have a terrible life?"}, {"time": 8779, "text": "Or is it some combination of the two?"}, {"time": 8781, "text": "So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell, you don't have a terrible life."}, {"time": 8789, "text": "You have friends, you have family, you have an intimate relationship, you have a job or a career, you're about as educated as you

so then sometimes there's a biochemical route to that treatment of that."}, {"time": 8819, "text": "My experience has been as a clinician is if you're depressed, but you have a life and you take an antidepressant, it will probably help you a lot."}, {"time": 8827, "text": "Now, maybe you're not depressed."}, {"time": 8829, "text": "Exactly, you just have a terrible life."}, {"time": 8835,

do two things."}, {"time": 8867, "text": "Well, if it's depression per se, well, like I said, there's sometimes a biochemical route, a nutritional route, there's ways that can be addressed."},

clients to whom no one ever paid any attention."}, {"time": 8949, "text": "And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention."}, {"time": 8952, "text": "And some of that was just listening because they had 10,000 hours of conversations they never had with anyone."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "And they were all tangled up in their head."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "And they had to just, one client in particular, I worked with this person for 15 years."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "And what she wanted from me was for me just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes."}, {"time": 8976, "text": "It was very hard for me."}, {"time": 8978, "text": "And to just tell me what had happened to her."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "And then what happened at the end of the conversation, then I could discuss a bit with her."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "And then as we progressed through the years, the amount of time that we spent in discussion increased in proportion in the sessions until by the time we stopped seeing each other, when my clinical practice collapsed, we were talking about 80% of the time."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "But she literally, she'd never been attended to properly ever."}, {"time": 9009,

9019, "text": "And so you can do that in therapy."}, {"time": 9022, "text": "If you're listening and you're depressed, I would say if you can't find a therapist, and that's getting harder and harder because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now because you have to agree with your clients, which is a terrible thing to do with them."}, {"time": 9037, "text": "Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "You could do the self authoring program online because it helps you write an autobiography."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "And so if you have memories that are more than 18 months old that bother you when you think them up, part of you is locked inside that."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that."},

would say wait for at least 18 months if something bad has happened to you."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again by encountering it."}, {"time": 9074, "text": "You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography."}, {"time": 9076, "text": "There's an analysis of faults and virtues, that's the present authoring."}, {"time": 9080, "text": "And then there's a guided writing exercise that helps you make a future plan."}, {"time": 9085, "text": "That's young men who do that could go to college, young men who do that, 90 minutes, just the future authoring, 90 minutes, they're 50% less likely to drop out."}, {"time": 9098, "text": "So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it."}, {"time": 9106, "text": "Or you said isolate, make a friend."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "Oh man, sometimes the first step is extremely difficult."}, {"time": 9112, "text": "Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "Like I had clients who were so depressed they literally couldn't get out of bed."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "So what's their first step?"}, {"time": 9121, "text": "It's like, can you sit up once today?"}, {"time": 9127, "text": "Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?"}, {"time": 9130, "text": "Like you just, you scale back the dragon till you find one that's

bit of goal."}, {"time": 9145, "text": "Commensurate with the struggle."}, {"time": 9147, "text": "But the plus side of that, cause that's, you think that God, that's depressing."}, {"time": 9151, "text": "You mean I have to start by sitting up?"}, {"time": 9155, "text": "Well you do if you can't sit up."}, {"time": 9157, "text": "But the plus side of that is it's the Pareto distribution issue is that aggregates exponentially increase and failures do too by the way."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "But aggregates exponentially increase."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "So once you start the ball rolling it can get zipping along pretty good."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "This person that I talked about was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe when we first met just talking even though I was her therapist."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "But by the end she was doing standup comedy."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "So, you know, it took years, but still most people won't do standup comedy."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "That's quite the bloody achievement."}, {"time": 9195, "text": "She would read her poetry on stage too."}, {"time": 9200, "text": "So for someone who was petrified into paralysis by social anxiety and who had to start very small, it was a hell of an accomplishment."}, {"time": 9211, "text": "Yeah, it all starts with one step."}, {"time": 9213, "text": "Do you have advice for young people in high school?"}, {"time": 9218, "text": "You've given, a lot of people look up to you for advice, for strength, for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves."}, {"time":
