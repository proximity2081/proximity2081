conversation with it."}, {"time": 268, "text": "You can actually talk to it for hours."}, {"time": 271, "text": "So it requires a little more depth."}, {"time": 275, "text": "There's some problems with large language models which we can talk about."}, {"time": 281, "text": "But some people are convinced by the Turing test."}, {"time": 286, "text": "Now, if somebody passes the Turing test, what are the implications of that?"}, {"time": 292, "text": "Does that mean that they're sentient, that they're conscious or not?"}, {"time": 296, "text": "It's not necessarily clear what the implications are."}, {"time": 300, "text": "Anyway, I believe 2029, that's six, seven years from now, we'll have something that passes the Turing test and a valid Turing test, meaning it goes for hours, not just a few minutes."}, {"time": 315, "text": "Can you speak to that a little bit?"}, {"time": 316, "text": "What is your formulation of the Turing test?"}, {"time": 321, "text": "You've proposed a very difficult version of the Turing test, so what does that look like?"}, {"time": 325, "text": "Basically, it's just to assess it over several hours and also have a human judge that's fairly sophisticated on what computers can do and can't do."}, {"time": 340, "text": "If you take somebody who's not that sophisticated or even an average engineer, they may not really assess various aspects of it."}, {"time": 352, "text": "So you really want the human to challenge the system."}, {"time": 357, "text": "On its ability to do things like common sense reasoning, perhaps."}, {"time": 360, "text": "That's actually a key problem with large language models."}, {"time": 364, "text": "They don't do these kinds of tests that would involve assessing chains of reasoning, but you can lose track of that."}, {"time": 378, "text": "If you talk to them, they actually can talk to you pretty well and you can be convinced by it, but it's somebody that would really convince you that it's a human, whatever that takes."}, {"time": 392, "text": "Maybe it would take days or weeks, but it would really convince you that it's human."}, {"time": 400, "text": "Large language models can appear that way."}, {"time": 405, "text": "You can read conversations and they appear pretty good."}, {"time": 409, "text": "There are some problems with it."}, {"time": 412, "text": "It doesn't do math very well."}, {"time": 415, "text": "You can ask how many legs did 10 elephants have and they'll tell you, well, okay, each elephant has four legs and it's 10 elephants, so it's 40 legs."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And you go, okay, that's pretty good."}, {"time": 425, "text": "How many legs do 11 elephants have?"}, {"time": 427, "text": "And they don't seem to understand the question."}, {"time": 431, "text": "Do all humans understand that question?"}, {"time": 434, "text": "No, that's the key thing."}, {"time": 435, "text": "I mean, how advanced a human do you want it to be?"}, {"time": 439, "text": "But we do expect a human to be able to do multi chain reasoning, to be able to take a few facts and put them together, not perfectly."}, {"time": 449, "text": "And we see that in a lot of polls that people don't do that perfectly at all."}, {"time": 459, "text": "So it's not very well defined, but it's something where it really would convince you that it's a human."}, {"time": 465, "text": "Is your intuition that large language models will not be solely the kind of system that passes the Turing test in 2029?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "Do we need something else?"}, {"time": 476, "text": "No, I think it will be a large language model, but they have to go beyond what they're doing now."}, {"time": 482, "text": "I think we're getting there."}, {"time": 485, "text": "And another key issue is if somebody actually passes the Turing test validly, I would believe they're conscious."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And then not everybody would say that."}, {"time": 495, "text": "It's okay, we can pass the Turing test, but we don't really believe that it's conscious."}, {"time": 500, "text": "That's a whole nother issue."}, {"time": 503, "text": "But if it really passes the Turing test, I would believe that it's conscious."}, {"time": 506, "text": "But I don't believe that of large language models today."}, {"time": 512, "text": "If it appears to be conscious, that's as good as being conscious, at least for you, in some sense."}, {"time": 520, "text": "I mean, consciousness is not something that's scientific."}, {"time": 526, "text": "I mean, I believe you're conscious, but it's really just a belief, and we believe that about other humans that at least appear to be conscious."}, {"time": 537, "text": "When you go outside of shared human assumption, like are animals conscious?"}, {"time": 544, "text": "Some people believe they're not conscious."}, {"time": 546, "text": "Some people believe they are conscious."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And would a machine that acts just like a human be conscious?"}, {"time": 554, "text": "I mean, I believe it would be."}, {"time": 557, "text": "But that's really a philosophical belief."}, {"time": 560, "text": "You can't prove it."}, {"time": 562, "text": "I can't take an entity and prove that it's conscious."}, {"time": 565, "text": "There's nothing that you can do that would indicate that."}, {"time": 570, "text": "It's like saying a piece of art is beautiful."}, {"time": 572, "text": "You can say it."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Multiple people can experience a piece of art as beautiful, but you can't prove it."}, {"time": 581, "text": "But it's also an extremely important issue."}, {"time": 584, "text": "I mean, imagine if you had something where nobody's conscious."}, {"time": 589, "text": "The world may as well not exist."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And so some people, like say Marvin Minsky, said, well, consciousness is not logical, it's not scientific, and therefore we should dismiss it, and any talk about consciousness is just not to be believed."}, {"time": 615, "text": "But when he actually engaged with somebody who was conscious, he actually acted as if they were conscious."}, {"time": 622, "text": "He didn't ignore that."}, {"time": 624, "text": "He acted as if consciousness does matter."}, {"time": 628, "text": "Whereas he said it didn't matter."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Well, that's Marvin Minsky."}, {"time": 632, "text": "He's full of contradictions."}, {"time": 634, "text": "But that's true of a lot of people as well."}, {"time": 637, "text": "But to you, consciousness matters."}, {"time": 639, "text": "But to me, it's very important."}, {"time": 642, "text": "But I would say it's not a scientific issue."}, {"time": 645, "text": "It's a philosophical issue."}, {"time": 649, "text": "And people have different views."}, {"time": 650, "text": "Some people believe that anything that makes a decision is conscious."}, {"time": 654, "text": "So your light switch is conscious."}, {"time": 656, "text": "Its level of consciousness is low, not very interesting, but that's a consciousness."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So a computer that makes a more interesting decision is still not at human levels, but it's also conscious and at a higher level than your light switch."}, {"time": 673, "text": "So that's one view."}, {"time": 677, "text": "There's many different views of what consciousness is."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So if a system passes the Turing test, it's not scientific, but in issues of philosophy, things like ethics start to enter the picture."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Do you think there would be, we would start contending as a human species about the ethics of turning off such a machine?"}, {"time": 702, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's definitely come up."}, {"time": 707, "text": "Hasn't come up in reality yet."}, {"time": 709, "text": "Yet."}, {"time": 710, "text": "But I'm talking about 2029."}, {"time": 712, "text": "It's not that many years from now."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So what are our obligations to it?"}, {"time": 719, "text": "It has a different, I mean, a computer that's conscious, it has a little bit different connotations than a human."}, {"time": 728, "text": "We have a continuous consciousness."}, {"time": 735, "text": "We're in an entity that does not last forever."}, {"time": 742, "text": "Now, actually, a significant portion of humans still exist and are therefore still conscious."}, {"time": 751, "text": "But anybody who is over a certain age doesn't exist anymore."}, {"time": 757, "text": "That wouldn't be true of a computer program."}, {"time": 760, "text": "You could completely turn it off and a copy of it could be stored and you could recreate it."}, {"time": 766, "text": "And so it has a different type of validity."}, {"time": 771, "text": "You could actually take it back in time."}, {"time": 772, "text": "You could eliminate its memory and have it go over again."}, {"time": 775, "text": "I mean, it has a different kind of connotation than humans do."}, {"time": 781, "text": "Well, perhaps it can do the same thing with humans."}, {"time": 784, "text": "It's just that we don't know how to do that yet."}, {"time": 786, "text": "It's possible that we figure out all of these things on the machine first."}, {"time": 792, "text": "But that doesn't mean the machine isn't conscious."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I mean, if you look at the way people react, say, 3CPO or other machines that are conscious in movies, they don't actually present how it's conscious, but we see that they are a machine and people will believe that they are conscious and they'll actually worry about it if they get into trouble and so on."}, {"time": 817, "text": "So 2029 is going to be the first year when a major thing happens."}, {"time": 824, "text": "And that will shake our civilization to start to consider the role of AI in this world."}, {"time": 831, "text": "I mean, this one guy at Google claimed that the machine was conscious."}, {"time": 838, "text": "But that's just one person."}, {"time": 841, "text": "When it starts to happen to scale."}, {"time": 843, "text": "Well, that's exactly right because most people have not taken that position."}, {"time": 847, "text": "I don't take that position."}, {"time": 848, "text": "I mean, I've used different things like this and they don't appear to me to be conscious."}, {"time": 860, "text": "As we eliminate various problems of these large language models, more and more people will accept that they're conscious."}, {"time": 870, "text": "So when we get to 2029, I think a large fraction of people will believe that they're conscious."}, {"time": 879, "text": "So it's not gonna happen all at once."}, {"time": 882, "text": "I believe it will actually happen gradually and it's already started to happen."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And so that takes us one step closer to the singularity."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Another step then is in the 2030s when we can actually connect our neocortex, which is where we do our thinking, to computers."}, {"time": 904, "text": "And I mean, just as this actually gains a lot to being connected to computers that will amplify its abilities, I mean, if this did not have any connection, it would be pretty stupid."}, {"time": 919, "text": "It could not answer any of your questions."}, {"time": 921, "text": "If you're just listening to this, by the way, Ray's holding up the all powerful smartphone."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So we're gonna do that directly from our brains."}, {"time": 933, "text": "I mean, these are pretty good."}, {"time": 935, "text": "These already have amplified our intelligence."}, {"time": 937, "text": "I'm already much smarter than I would otherwise be if I didn't have this."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Because I remember my first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, there was no way to get information from computers."}, {"time": 952, "text": "I actually would go to a library, find a book, find the page that had an information I wanted, and I'd go to the copier, and my most significant information tool was a roll of quarters where I could feed the copier."}, {"time": 968, "text": "So we're already greatly advanced that we have these things."}, {"time": 973, "text": "There's a few problems with it."}, {"time": 975, "text": "First of all, I constantly put it down, and I don't remember where I put it."}, {"time": 979, "text": "I've actually never lost it."}, {"time": 981, "text": "But you have to find it, and then you have to turn it on."}, {"time": 986, "text": "So there's a certain amount of steps."}, {"time": 988, "text": "It would actually be quite useful if someone would just listen to your conversation and say, oh, that's so and so actress, and tell you what you're talking about."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "So going from active to passive, where it just permeates your whole life."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "The way your brain does when you're awake."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "Your brain is always there."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "That's something that could actually just about be done today, where we'd listen to your conversation, understand what you're saying, understand what you're not missing, and give you that information."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "But another step is to actually go inside your brain."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And there are some prototypes where you can connect your brain."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "They actually don't have the amount of bandwidth that we need."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "They can work, but they work fairly slowly."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So if it actually would connect to your neocortex, and the neocortex, which I describe in How to Create a Mind, the neocortex is actually, it has different levels, and as you go up the levels, it's kind of like a pyramid."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "The top level is fairly small, and that's the level where you wanna connect these brain extenders."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "And so I believe that will happen in the 2030s."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So just the way this is greatly amplified by being connected to the cloud, we can connect our own brain to the cloud, and just do what we can do by using this machine."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Do you think it would look like the brain computer interface of like Neuralink?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "So would it be?"}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Well, Neuralink, it's an attempt to do that."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "It doesn't have the bandwidth that we need."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Yet, right?"}, {"time": 1107, "text": "Right, but I think, I mean, they're gonna get permission for this because there are a lot of people who absolutely need it because they can't communicate."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "I know a couple people like that who have ideas and they cannot, they cannot move their muscles and so on."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "And so for them, this would be very valuable, but we could all use it."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "Basically, it'd be, turn us into something that would be like we have a phone, but it would be in our minds."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It would be kind of instantaneous."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And maybe communication between two people would not require this low bandwidth mechanism of language."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "We don't know what that would be, although we do know that computers can share information like language instantly."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "They can share many, many books in a second."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So we could do that as well."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "If you look at what our brain does, it actually can manipulate different parameters."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "So we talk about these large language models."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I mean, I had written that it requires a certain amount of information in order to be effective and that we would not see AI really being effective until it got to that level."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And we had large language models that were like 10 billion bytes, didn't work very well."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "They finally got to a hundred billion bytes and now they work fairly well."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "And now we're going to a trillion bytes."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "If you say lambda has a hundred billion bytes, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 1223, "text": "Well, what if you had something that had one byte, one parameter, maybe you wanna tell whether or not something's an elephant or not."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And so you put in something that would detect its trunk."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "If it has a trunk, it's an elephant."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "If it doesn't have a trunk, it's not an elephant."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "That would work fairly well."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And it really wouldn't be able to tell what a trunk is, but anyway."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And maybe other things other than elephants have trunks, you might get really confused."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "I'm not sure which animals have trunks, but how do you define a trunk?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "But yeah, that's one parameter."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "You can do okay."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So these things have a hundred billion parameters."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "So they're able to deal with very complex issues."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "All kinds of trunks."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Human beings actually have a little bit more than that, but they're getting to the point where they can emulate humans."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "If we were able to connect this to our neocortex, we would basically add more of these abilities to make distinctions, and it could ultimately be much smarter and also be attached to information that we feel is reliable."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So that's where we're headed."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So you think that there will be a merger in the 30s, an increasing amount of merging between the human brain and the AI brain?"}, {"time": 1317, "text": "And the AI brain is really an emulation of human beings."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "I mean, that's why we're creating them, because human beings act the same way, and this is basically to amplify them."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "I mean, this amplifies our brain."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It's a little bit clumsy to interact with, but it definitely is way beyond what we had 15 years ago."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "But the implementation becomes different, just like a bird versus the airplane, even though the AI brain is an emulation, it starts adding features we might not otherwise have, like ability to consume a huge amount of information quickly, like look up thousands of Wikipedia articles in one take."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I mean, we can get, for example, issues like simulated biology, where it can simulate many different things at once."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "We already had one example of simulated biology, which is the Moderna vaccine."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And that's gonna be now the way in which we create medications."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But they were able to simulate what each example of an mRNA would do to a human being, and they were able to simulate that quite reliably."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And we actually simulated billions of different mRNA sequences, and they found the ones that were the best, and they created the vaccine."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And they did, and talked about doing that quickly, they did that in two days."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Now, how long would a human being take to simulate billions of different mRNA sequences?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "I don't know that we could do it at all, but it would take many years."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "They did it in two days, and one of the reasons that people didn't like vaccines is because it was done too quickly, it was done too fast."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And they actually included the time it took to test it out, which was 10 months, so they figured, okay, it took 10 months to create this."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "Actually, it took us two days."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And we also will be able to ultimately do the tests in a few days as well."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Oh, because we can simulate how the body will respond to it."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Yeah, that's a little bit more complicated because the body has a lot of different elements, and we have to simulate all of that, but that's coming as well."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So ultimately, we could create it in a few days and then test it in a few days, and it would be done."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And we can do that with every type of medical insufficiency that we have."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "So curing all diseases, improving certain functions of the body, supplements, drugs for recreation, for health, for performance, for productivity, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Well, that's where we're headed, because I mean, right now we have a very inefficient way of creating these new medications."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "But we've already shown it, and the Moderna vaccine is actually the best of the vaccines we've had, and it literally took two days to create."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And we'll get to the point where we can test it out also quickly."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Are you impressed by AlphaFold and the solution to the protein folding, which essentially is simulating, modeling this primitive building block of life, which is a protein, and its 3D shape?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "It's pretty remarkable that they can actually predict what the 3D shape of these things are, but they did it with the same type of neural net that won, for example, the Go test."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So it's all the same."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "All the same approaches."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "They took that same thing and just changed the rules to chess, and within a couple of days, it now played a master level of chess greater than any human being."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And the same thing then worked for AlphaFold, which no human had done."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "I mean, human beings could do, the best humans could maybe do 15, 20% of figuring out what the shape would be."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "And after a few takes, it ultimately did just about 100%."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "Do you still think the singularity will happen in 2045?"}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Once we can amplify our brain with computers directly, which will happen in the 2030s, that's gonna keep growing."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "That's another whole theme, which is the exponential growth of computing power."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Yeah, so looking at price performance of computation from 1939 to 2021."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Right, so that starts with the very first computer actually created by a German during World War II."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "You might have thought that that might be significant, but actually the Germans didn't think computers were significant, and they completely rejected it."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "The second one is also the ZUSA 2."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And by the way, we're looking at a plot with the X axis being the year from 1935 to 2025."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And on the Y axis in log scale is computation per second per constant dollar."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "So dollar normalized inflation."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "And it's growing linearly on the log scale, which means it's growing exponentially."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "The third one was the British computer, which the Allies did take very seriously."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "And it cracked the German code and enables the British to win the Battle of Britain, which otherwise absolutely would not have happened if they hadn't cracked the code using that computer."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "But that's an exponential graph."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So a straight line on that graph is exponential growth."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And you see 80 years of exponential growth."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And I would say about every five years, and this happened shortly before the pandemic, people saying, well, they call it Moore's law, which is not the correct, because that's not all intel."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "In fact, this started decades before intel was even created."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "It wasn't with transistors formed into a grid."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "So it's not just transistor count or transistor size."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Right, it started with relays, then went to vacuum tubes, then went to individual transistors, and then to integrated circuits."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "And integrated circuits actually starts like in the middle of this graph."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "And it has nothing to do with intel."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "Intel actually was a key part of this."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "But a few years ago, they stopped making the fastest chips."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "But if you take the fastest chip of any technology in that year, you get this kind of graph."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And it's definitely continuing for 80 years."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "So you don't think Moore's law, broadly defined, is dead."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "It's been declared dead multiple times throughout this process."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "I don't like the term Moore's law, because it has nothing to do with Moore or with intel."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "But yes, the exponential growth of computing is continuing."}, {"time":
