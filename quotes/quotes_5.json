now."}, {"time": 439, "text": "So in the 1970s, the personal computer was being born."}, {"time": 444, "text": "So did you sense, in tinkering with these circuits, did you sense the encroaching revolution in personal computing?"}, {"time": 453, "text": "So if at that point, we would sit you down and ask you to predict the 80s and the 90s, do you think you would be able to do so successfully to unroll the process that's happening?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "No, I had no clue."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And I had never heard that word."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And so there is maybe some echoes of computers there, but I never made that connection."}, {"time": 529, "text": "I didn't know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using punched cards, that there was something called a computer that was involved that read those cards and transferred the money between accounts."}, {"time": 548, "text": "I was also not really interested in those things."}, {"time": 548, "text": "It was only when I went to university to study math that I found out that they had a computer, and students were allowed to use it."}, {"time": 569, "text": "The computer wasn't really connected to the real world."}, {"time": 581, "text": "You gave the punched cards to the operator, and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout."}, {"time": 587, "text": "And so all you could do was write a program that did something very abstract."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And I don't even remember what my first forays into programming were, but they were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a programming language worked."}, {"time": 615, "text": "Did you sense, okay, first year of college, you see this computer, you're able to have a program and it generates some output."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Did you start seeing the possibility of this, or was it a continuation of the tinkering with circuits?"}, {"time": 629, "text": "Did you start to imagine that one, the personal computer, but did you see it as something that is a tool, like a word processing tool, maybe for gaming or something?"}, {"time": 642, "text": "Or did you start to imagine that it could be going to the world of robotics, like the Frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "There's like another entity in front of you."}, {"time": 653, "text": "You did not see the computer."}, {"time": 660, "text": "I don't think I really saw it that way."}, {"time": 660, "text": "I was really more interested in the tinkering."}, {"time": 665, "text": "It's maybe not a sort of a complete coincidence that I ended up sort of creating a programming language which is a tool for other programmers."}, {"time": 674, "text": "I've always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and not so much what happens with the program you write."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I do remember, and I don't remember, maybe in my second or third year, probably my second actually, someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called Conway's Game of Life."}, {"time": 706, "text": "You're probably familiar with it."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So there was a Scientific American column by someone who did a monthly column about mathematical diversions."}, {"time": 720, "text": "I'm also blanking out on the guy's name."}, {"time": 720, "text": "It was very famous at the time and I think up to the 90s or so."}, {"time": 726, "text": "And one of his columns was about Conway's Game of Life and he had some illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of there was the suggestion that this was philosophically interesting, that that was why Conway had called it that."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And all I had was like the two pages photocopy of that article."}, {"time": 743, "text": "I don't even remember where I got it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "But it spoke to me and I remember implementing a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where I had a whole Pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that said do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of sort of things."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I remember much later I've done a similar thing using Python but that original version I wrote at the time I found interesting because I combined it with some trick I had learned during my electronics hobbyist times."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I essentially first on paper I designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input which is sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for that cell and it's like a combination of a half adder and some other clipping."}, {"time": 834, "text": "It's actually a full adder."}, {"time": 834, "text": "And so I had worked that out and then I translated that into a series of Boolean operations on Pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise values."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And so I could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in like eight instructions or so."}, {"time": 869, "text": "So I was proud of that."}, {"time": 872, "text": "It's funny that you mentioned, so for people who don't know Conway's Game of Life, it's a cellular automata where there's single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors and this is deeply distributed system in concept at least."}, {"time": 890, "text": "And then there's simple rules that all of them follow and somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 904, "text": "There's an emergent complexity."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Even though the underlying rules are simple, there's an emergent complexity."}, {"time": 913, "text": "Now the funny thing is you've implemented this and the thing you're commenting on is you're proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently."}, {"time": 923, "text": "When you're not commenting on, it's a beautiful implementation, you're not commenting on the fact that there's an emergent complexity that you've coded a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation, that's stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And is that magic?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "I mean, that's the magic that all of us feel when we program."}, {"time": 948, "text": "When you create a program and then you run it and whether it's Hello World or it shows something on screen, if there's a graphical component, are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "I think I went back and forth."}, {"time": 965, "text": "As a student, we had an incredibly small budget of computer time that we could use."}, {"time": 974, "text": "It was actually measured."}, {"time": 974, "text": "I once got in trouble with one of my professors because I had overspent the department's budget."}, {"time": 980, "text": "It's a different story."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I actually wanted the efficient implementation because I also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger size of the board."}, {"time": 996, "text": "Once the implementation was flawless, I would feed it different patterns and then I think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that were like gliders, patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations but translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "I remember things like glider guns."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Well, you can Google Conway's Game of Life."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "People still go aww and ooh over it."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "For a reason because it's not really well understood why."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "I mean, this is what Stephen Wolfram is obsessed about."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "We don't have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "The only way you can do is to run it."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I'm not convinced that it's sort of a problem that lends itself to classic mathematical analysis."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "One theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being is you kind of have to, same with the Game of Life, you kind of have to create a universe and let it run."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "That creating it from scratch in a design way, coding up a Python program that creates a fully intelligent system may be quite challenging."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "You might need to create a universe just like the Game of Life."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "You might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a set of rules that doesn't essentially always just end up repeating itself in a trivial way."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "Yeah, and Stephen Wolfram works with these simple rules, says that it's kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "You shouldn't be able to, but somehow you do."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And so maybe our universe is laden with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans, but emergent phenomena that's interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "But let me sort of ask, at that time, some of the world, at least in popular press, was kind of captivated, perhaps at least in America, by the idea of artificial intelligence, that these computers would be able to think pretty soon."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And did that touch you at all?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "In science fiction or in reality in any way?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "I didn't really start reading science fiction until much, much later."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "I think as a teenager I read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Was it in the background somewhere, like in your thoughts?"}, {"time": 1197, "text": "That sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always felt to me, because I felt I had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And sort of, I didn't believe at all that you could just build something intelligent out of that, that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "That was about consciousness, and that was a big eye opener in some sense."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "In what sense?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So, on your own brain, did you at the time or do you now see your own brain as a computer?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "Or is there a total separation of the way?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So yeah, you're very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory, the limits of this sequential computing or weakly paralyzed computing, and you just know what we have now, and it's hard to see how it creates."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "But it's also easy to see, it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and now at least similarities between the brain and our computers."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Oh yeah, I mean, I totally believe that brains are computers in some sense."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "I mean, the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we can sort of implement in our current hardware, but I don't believe in, like, a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or consciousness or any of that."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "There's no soul, I've been an atheist probably from when I was 10 years old, just by thinking a bit about math and the universe, and well, my parents were atheists."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "Now, I know that you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set of rules."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I am not in that camp."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I totally see that, sort of, given how many millions of years evolution took its time, DNA is a particular machine that sort of encodes information and an unlimited amount of information in chemical form and has figured out a way to replicate itself."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "I thought that that was, maybe it's 300 million years ago, but I thought it was closer to half a billion years ago, that that's sort of originated and it hasn't really changed, that the sort of the structure of DNA hasn't changed ever since."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "That is like our binary code that we have in hardware."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "The basic programming language hasn't changed, but maybe the programming itself... Obviously, it did sort of, it happened to be a set of rules that was good enough to sort of develop endless variability and sort of the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources and one type eventually sort of always taking over."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "That happened before there were any fossils, so we don't know how that exactly happened, but I believe it's clear that that did happen."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Can you comment on consciousness and how you see it?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Because I think we'll talk about programming quite a bit."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "We'll talk about, you know, intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally, but consciousness is this whole other thing."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language and as a human?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Those are pretty sort of separate topics."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Sort of my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness, but sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing, I have some thoughts which is mostly that I don't actually believe that consciousness is an all or nothing thing."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "I have a feeling that, and I forget what I read that influenced this, but I feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse, they have some form of intelligence."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "If you look at a fish, it has some form of intelligence, and that evolution just took a long time, but I feel that the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of the senses, especially the visual sense."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "I mean, there is an enormous amount of processing that's needed to interpret a scene, and humans are still better at that than computers are."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And I have a feeling that there is a sort of, the reason that like mammals in particular developed the levels of consciousness that they have and that eventually sort of going from intelligence to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being a robot that has very highly developed senses."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "As far as robots go, I think that the self driving cars have that sort of the greatest opportunity of developing something like that, because when I drive myself, I don't just pay attention to the rules of the road."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I also look around and I get clues from that, oh, this is a shopping district, oh, here's an old lady crossing the street, oh, here is someone carrying a pile of mail, there's a mailbox, I bet you they're going to cross the street to reach that mailbox."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "And I slow down, and I don't even think about that."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And so, there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what other consciousnesses are going to do, or what other systems in the world are going to be, oh, that tree is going to fall."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I see sort of, I see much more of, I expect somehow that if anything is going to become unconscious, it's going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion computers in a Google or Amazon data center that are all networked together to do whatever they do."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So, in that sense, so you actually highlight, because that's what I work in Thomas Vehicles, you highlight the big gap between what we currently can't do and what we truly need to be able to do to solve the problem."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Under that formulation, then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should have in order to interact with us humans, as opposed to some kind of abstract notion of a consciousness."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize, to be able to fear, understand what the fear of death is, all these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians, you need to be able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And if you sort of, yeah, if you look at the dog, the dog clearly knows, I mean, I'm not the dog owner, but I have friends who have dogs, the dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do, or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do and they learn."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Some dogs know when you're going out and they want to go out with you, they're sad when you leave them alone, they cry, they're afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "We don't assign sort of consciousness to dogs, or at least not all that much, but I also don't think they have none of that."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So I think it's consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "The spectrum is really interesting."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "But in returning to programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things, about building intelligence, building consciousness, building artificial beings."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So I think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with Leibniz, Hobbes, Descartes, where there's this feeling that you can convert all thought, all reasoning, all the thing that we find very special in our brains, you can convert all of that into logic."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So you can formalize it, formal reasoning, and then once you formalize everything, all of knowledge, then you can just calculate and that's what we're doing with our brains is we're calculating."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So there's this whole idea that this is possible, that this we can actually program."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "But they weren't aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are aware of it now."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "They sort of thought they had discovered incredible bits of mathematics like Newton's calculus and their sort of idealism, their sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went along those lines and they thought there's like, yeah, logic."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "There's like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "They didn't realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules but is a shit ton of data plus a circuit that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored rules."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "I mean, if I see you tomorrow here in front of the Dropbox office, I might recognize you."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "Even if I'm wearing a different shirt, yeah, but if I see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in Belmont, I might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "I make those kind of mistakes myself all the time."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I see someone that I only know as like, oh, this person is a colleague of my wife's and then I see them at the movies and I didn't recognize them."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "But do you see those, you call it pattern matching, do you see that rules is unable to encode that?"}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Everything you see, all the pieces of information you look around this room, I'm wearing a black shirt, I have a certain height, I'm a human, all these, there's probably tens of thousands of facts you pick up moment by moment about this scene."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "You take them for granted and you aggregate them together to understand the scene."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "You don't think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day, you can just put it all on the table and calculate?"}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I don't know what that means."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "I mean, yes, in the sense that there is no actual magic there, but there are enough layers of abstraction from the facts as they enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that I don't think that AI has really covered enough of that distance."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "It's like if you take a human body and you realize it's built out of atoms, well, that is a uselessly reductionist view, right?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "The body is built out of organs, the organs are built out of cells, the cells are built out of proteins, the proteins are built out of amino acids, the amino acids are built out of atoms and then you get to quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "So that's a very pragmatic view."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "I mean, obviously as an engineer, I agree with that kind of view, but you also have to consider the Sam Harris view of, well, intelligence is just information processing."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "Like you said, you take in sensory information, you do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "That makes it sound so easy."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "I don't know who Sam Harris is."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Oh, well, it's a philosopher."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "So like this is how philosophers often think, right?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And essentially that's what Descartes was, is wait a minute, if there is, like you said, no magic, so he basically says it doesn't appear like there's any magic, but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "So just because we know that we're made of atoms, just because we know we're made of organs, the fact that we know very little how to get from the atoms to organs in a way that's recreatable means that you shouldn't get too excited just yet about the fact that you figured out that we're made of atoms."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "Right, and the same about taking facts as our sensory organs take them in and turning that into reasons and actions, that sort of, there are a lot of abstractions that we haven't quite figured out how to deal with those."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "That's also true, probably."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "People want to take a shortcut, but there's sort of, this abstraction is a data structure that the compiler then uses to produce outputs that is relevant, like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by hardware, and then that data structure gets thrown away."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "Yeah, in some sense, the same abstraction for motion is probably one of the primary sources of our, of information for us, we just know what to do, I think we know what to do with that, we've built up other abstractions on top."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "On the other hand, how do I recognize your face, I have no idea."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Right, so our actual day to day lives, we're operating at the very highest level of abstraction, we're just not even conscious of all the little details underlying it."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "There's compilers on top of, it's like turtles on top of turtles, or turtles all the way down, there's compilers all the way down, but that's essentially, you say that there's no magic, that's what I, what I was trying to get at, I think, is with Descartes started this whole train of saying that there's no magic, I mean, there's all this beforehand."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Well didn't Descartes also have the notion though that the soul and the body were fundamentally separate?"}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Separate, yeah, I think he had to write in God in there for political reasons, so I don't know actually, I'm not a historian, but there's notions in there that all of reasoning, all of human thought can be formalized."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "I think that continued in the 20th century with Russell and with Gadot's incompleteness theorem, this debate of what are the limits of the things that could be formalized, that's where the Turing machine came along, and this exciting idea, I mean, underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "You can encode a lot of the stuff we're talking about in terms of recognizing faces and so on, theoretically, in an algorithm that can then run on a computer."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "And in that context, I'd like to ask programming in a philosophical way, what does it mean to program a computer?"}, {"time": 2526, "text": "So you said you write a Python program or compiled a C++ program that compiles to some byte code, it's forming layers, you're programming a layer of abstraction that's higher, how do you see programming in that context?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "Can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "I think at some point the higher levels of abstraction will not be called programming and they will not resemble what we call programming at the moment."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "You can like prove that Aristotelian sieve produces all prime numbers and only prime numbers."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So I don't know if you know who Andrej Karpathy is, I'm afraid not."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So he's a head of AI at Tesla now, but he was at Stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept software 2.0."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So let me disentangle that for a second."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "So kind of what you're referring to is the traditional, the algorithm, the concept of an algorithm, something that's there, it's clear, you can read it, you understand it, you can prove it's functioning as kind of software 1.0."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And what software 2.0 is, is exactly what you described, which is you have neural networks, which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "All you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you can't look inside."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "You can't analyze it."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "All you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "And that's as programming becomes getting a lot of data."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "That's what programming is."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Well, that would be programming 2.0."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "To programming 2.0."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "I wouldn't call that programming."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "It's just a different activity."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Well, so let's just step back and think sort of more generally, of course."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "But you know, it's like as a parent teaching your kids, things can be called programming."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "In that same sense, that's how programming is being used."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "You're providing them data, examples, use cases."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "So imagine writing a function not by, not with for loops and clearly readable text, but more saying, well, here's a lot of examples of what this

three months to do it, initial steps, so you just specified a bunch of goals, sort of things that you observe about Python, perhaps you had those goals, but how do you create the rules, the syntactic structure, the features that result in those?"}, {"time": 3865, "text": "So I have in the beginning and I have follow up questions about through the evolution of Python too, but in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical analyzer or whatever."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "Python was still a big part of it because I sort of, I said to myself, I don't want to have to design everything from scratch, I'm going to borrow features from other languages that I like."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So you basically, exactly, you first observe what you like."}, {"time": 3942, "text":

time and we said, can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that address those words?"}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And we had sort of in the past, we had always taken backwards compatibility very seriously."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And so many Python words in earlier versions had already been resolved because they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility

like roadblocks, but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over and you know that that's always the same thing that people trip over when they trip."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "And we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "But it's still an option to not resolve the issues, right?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "And so yes, for a long time, we had sort of resigned ourselves to, well, okay, the language is not going to be perfect in this way and that way and that way."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "And we sort of, certain of these,

but in the realm of AI assistance, what they're great at is computation, memory, it's infinite and pure."}, {"time": 374, "text": "These are the attributes you have to start respecting."}, {"time": 376, "text": "So I think the comparison with human like versus the other aspect, which is also superhuman, has to be taken into consideration."}, {"time": 382, "text": "So I think we need to elevate the discussion to not just human like."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So there's certainly elements, we just mentioned, Alexa is everywhere, computation speaking."}, {"time": 393, "text": "So this is a much bigger infrastructure than just the thing that sits there in the room with you."}, {"time": 398, "text": "But it certainly feels to us mere humans that there's just another little creature there when you're interacting with it."}, {"time": 408, "text": "You're not interacting with the entirety of the infrastructure, you're interacting with the device."}, {"time": 412, "text": "The feeling is, okay, sure, we anthropomorphize things, but that feeling is still there."}, {"time": 418, "text": "So what do you think we as humans, the purity of the interaction with a smart device, interaction with a smart assistant, what do you think we look for in that interaction?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "I think in the certain interactions I think will be very much where it does feel like a human because it has a persona of its own."}, {"time": 439, "text": "And in certain ones it wouldn't be."}, {"time": 440, "text": "So I think a simple example to think of it is if you're walking through the house and you just wanna turn on your lights on and off and you're issuing a command, that's not very much like a human like interaction and that's where the AI shouldn't come back and have a conversation with you, just it should simply complete that command."}, {"time": 458, "text": "So those, I think the blend of, we have to think about this is not human, human alone."}, {"time": 463, "text": "It is a human machine interaction and certain aspects of humans are needed and certain aspects are in situations demand it to be like a machine."}, {"time": 471, "text": "So I told you, it's gonna be philosophical in parts."}, {"time": 475, "text": "What's the difference between human and machine in that interaction?"}, {"time": 478, "text": "When we interact to humans, especially those are friends and loved ones versus you and a machine that you also are close with."}, {"time": 490, "text": "I think the, you have to think about the roles the AI plays, right?"}, {"time": 493, "text": "So, and it differs from different customer to customer, different situation to situation, especially I can speak from Alexa's perspective."}, {"time": 501, "text": "It is a companion, a friend at times, an assistant, an advisor down the line."}, {"time": 507, "text": "So I think most AIs will have this kind of attributes and it will be very situational in nature."}, {"time": 513, "text": "So where is the boundary?"}, {"time": 514, "text": "I think the boundary depends on exact context in which you're interacting with the AI."}, {"time": 519, "text": "So the depth and the richness of natural language conversation is been by Alan Turing been used to try to define what it means to be intelligent."}, {"time": 530, "text": "There's a lot of criticism of that kind of test, but what do you think is a good test of intelligence in your view, in the context of the Turing test and Alexa or the Alexa prize, this whole realm, do you think about this human intelligence, what it means to define it, what it means to reach that level?"}, {"time": 550, "text": "I do think the ability to converse is a sign of an ultimate intelligence."}, {"time": 555, "text": "I think that there's no question about it."}, {"time": 558, "text": "So if you think about all aspects of humans, there are sensors we have, and those are basically a data collection mechanism."}, {"time": 566, "text": "And based on that, we make some decisions with our sensory brains, right?"}, {"time": 570, "text": "And from that perspective, I think there are elements we have to talk about how we sense the world and then how we act based on what we sense."}, {"time": 580, "text": "Those elements clearly machines have, but then there's the other aspects of computation that is way better."}, {"time": 588, "text": "I also mentioned about memory again, in terms of being near infinite, depending on the storage capacity you have, and the retrieval can be extremely fast and pure in terms of like, there's no ambiguity of who did I see when, right?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "I mean, machines can remember that quite well."}, {"time": 604, "text": "So again, on a philosophical level, I do subscribe to the fact that to be able to converse and as part of that, to be able to reason based on the world knowledge you've acquired and the sensory knowledge that is there is definitely very much the essence of intelligence."}, {"time": 623, "text": "But intelligence can go beyond human level intelligence based on what machines are getting capable of."}, {"time": 629, "text": "So what do you think maybe stepping outside of Alexa broadly as an AI field, what do you think is a good test of intelligence?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "Put it another way outside of Alexa, because so much of Alexa is a product, is an experience for the customer."}, {"time": 644, "text": "On the research side, what would impress the heck out of you if you saw, you know, what is the test where you said, wow, this thing is now starting to encroach into the realm of what we loosely think of as human intelligence?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "So, well, we think of it as AGI and human intelligence altogether, right?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "So in some sense, and I think we are quite far from that."}, {"time": 668, "text": "I think an unbiased view I have is that the Alexa's intelligence capability is a great test."}, {"time": 677, "text": "I think of it as there are many other true points like self driving cars, game playing like go or chess."}, {"time": 686, "text": "Let's take those two for as an example, clearly requires a lot of data driven learning and intelligence, but it's not as hard a problem as conversing with, as an AI is with humans to accomplish certain tasks or open domain chat, as you mentioned, Alexa prize."}, {"time": 704, "text": "In those settings, the key differences that the end goal is not defined unlike game playing."}, {"time": 711, "text": "You also do not know exactly what state you are in in a particular goal completion scenario."}, {"time": 718, "text": "In certain sense, sometimes you can, if it's a simple goal, but if you're even certain examples like planning a weekend or you can imagine how many things change along the way, you look for whether you may change your mind and you change the destination, or you want to catch a particular event and then you decide, no, I want this other event I want to go to."}, {"time": 740, "text": "So these dimensions of how many different steps are possible when you're conversing as a human with a machine makes it an extremely daunting problem."}, {"time": 749, "text": "And I think it is the ultimate test for intelligence."}, {"time": 752, "text": "And don't you think that natural language is enough to prove that conversation, just pure conversation?"}, {"time": 760, "text": "From a scientific standpoint, natural language is a great test, but I would go beyond, I don't want to limit it to as natural language as simply understanding an intent or parsing for entities and so forth."}, {"time": 772, "text": "We are really talking about dialogue."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Dialogue, yeah."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So I would say human machine dialogue is definitely one of the best tests of intelligence."}, {"time": 782, "text": "So can you briefly speak to the Alexa Prize for people who are not familiar with it, and also just maybe where things stand and what have you learned and what's surprising?"}, {"time": 795, "text": "What have you seen that's surprising from this incredible competition?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "Absolutely, it's a very exciting competition."}, {"time": 800, "text": "Alexa Prize is essentially a grand challenge in conversational artificial intelligence, where we threw the gauntlet to the universities who do active research in the field, to say, can you build what we call a social bot that can converse with you coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "That is an extremely hard challenge, talking to someone who you're meeting for the first time, or even if you've met them quite often, to speak at 20 minutes on any topic, an evolving nature of topics is super hard."}, {"time": 837, "text": "We have completed two successful years of the competition."}, {"time": 841, "text": "The first was won with the University of Washington, second, the University of California."}, {"time": 845, "text": "We are in our third instance."}, {"time": 846, "text": "We have an extremely strong team of 10 cohorts, and the third instance of the Alexa Prize is underway now."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And we are seeing a constant evolution."}, {"time": 857, "text": "First year was definitely a learning."}, {"time": 858, "text": "It was a lot of things to be put together."}, {"time": 861, "text": "We had to build a lot of infrastructure to enable these universities to be able to build magical experiences and do high quality research."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Just a few quick questions, sorry for the interruption."}, {"time": 873, "text": "What does failure look like in the 20 minute session?"}, {"time": 877, "text": "So what does it mean to fail, not to reach the 20 minute mark?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "Oh, awesome question."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So there are one, first of all, I forgot to mention one more detail."}, {"time": 885, "text": "It's not just 20 minutes, but the quality of the conversation too that matters."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And the beauty of this competition before I answer that question on what failure means is first that you actually converse with millions and millions of customers as the social bots."}, {"time": 900, "text": "So during the judging phases, there are multiple phases, before we get to the finals, which is a very controlled judging in a situation where we bring in judges and we have interactors who interact with these social bots, that is a much more controlled setting."}, {"time": 915, "text": "But till the point we get to the finals, all the judging is essentially by the customers of Alexa."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And there you basically rate on a simple question, how good your experience was."}, {"time": 928, "text": "So that's where we are not testing for a 20 minute boundary being crossed, because you do want it to be very much like a clear cut, winner, be chosen, and it's an absolute bar."}, {"time": 940, "text": "So did you really break that 20 minute barrier is why we have to test it in a more controlled setting with actors, essentially interactors."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And see how the conversation goes."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So this is why it's a subtle difference between how it's being tested in the field with real customers versus in the lab to award the prize."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So on the latter one, what it means is that essentially there are three judges and two of them have to say this conversation has stalled, essentially."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And the judges are human experts."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Judges are human experts."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So this is in the third year."}, {"time": 979, "text": "So what's been the evolution?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "How far, so the DARPA challenge in the first year, the autonomous vehicles, nobody finished."}, {"time": 986, "text": "In the second year, a few more finished in the desert."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So how far along in this, I would say much harder challenge are we?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "This challenge has come a long way to the extent that we're definitely not close to the 20 minute barrier being with coherence and engaging conversation."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "I think we are still five to 10 years away in that horizon to complete that."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "But the progress is immense."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Like what you're finding is the accuracy and what kind of responses these social bots generate is getting better and better."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "What's even amazing to see that now there's humor coming in."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "The bots are quite..."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You know, you're talking about ultimate science of intelligence."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "I think humor is a very high bar in terms of what it takes to create humor."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And I don't mean just being goofy."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "I really mean good sense of humor is also a sign of intelligence in my mind and something very hard to do."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So these social bots are now exploring not only what we think of natural language abilities, but also personality attributes and aspects of when to inject an appropriate joke, when you don't know the domain, how you come back with something more intelligible so that you can continue the conversation."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "If you and I are talking about AI and we are domain experts, we can speak to it."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "But if you suddenly switch a topic to that I don't know of, how do I change the conversation?"}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So you're starting to notice these elements as well."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And that's coming from partly by the nature of the 20 minute challenge that people are getting quite clever on how to really converse and essentially mask some of the understanding defects if they exist."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So some of this, this is not Alexa, the product."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "This is somewhat for fun, for research, for innovation and so on."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "I have a question sort of in this modern era, there's a lot of, if you look at Twitter and Facebook and so on, there's discourse, public discourse going on and some things that are a little bit too edgy, people get blocked and so on."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "I'm just out of curiosity, are people in this context pushing the limits?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Is anyone using the F word?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Is anyone sort of pushing back sort of arguing, I guess I should say, as part of the dialogue to really draw people in?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "First of all, let me just back up a bit in terms of why we are doing this, right?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So you said it's fun."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "I think fun is more part of the engaging part for customers."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "It is one of the most used skills as well in our skill store."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "But up that apart, the real goal was essentially what was happening is with a lot of AI research moving to industry, we felt that academia has the risk of not being able to have the same resources at disposal that we have, which is lots of data, massive computing power, and a clear ways to test these AI advances with real customer benefits."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So we brought all these three together in the Alexa price."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "That's why it's one of my favorite projects in Amazon."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "And with that, the secondary effect is yes, it has become engaging for our customers as well."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "We're not there in terms of where we want it to be, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "But it's a huge progress."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "But coming back to your question on how do the conversations evolve?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Yes, there is some natural attributes of what you said in terms of argument and some amount of swearing."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "The way we take care of that is that there is a sensitive filter we have built that sees keywords."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "It's more than keywords, a little more in terms of, of course, there's keyword based too, but there's more in terms of these words can be very contextual, as you can see, and also the topic can be something that you don't want a conversation to happen because this is a communal device as well."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "A lot of people use these devices."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So we have put a lot of guardrails for the conversation to be more useful for advancing AI and not so much of these other issues you attributed what's happening in the AI field as well."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "Right, so this is actually a serious opportunity."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "I didn't use the right word, fun."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "I think it's an open opportunity to do some of the best innovation in conversational agents in the world."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Why just universities?"}, {"time": 1249, "text": "Because as I said, I really felt Young minds."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "Young minds, it's also to, if you think about the other aspect of where the whole industry is moving with AI, there's a dearth of talent given the demands."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "So you do want universities to have a clear place where they can invent and research and not fall behind that they can't motivate students."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Imagine all grad students left to industry like us or faculty members, which has happened too."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "So this is a way that if you're so passionate about the field where you feel industry and academia need to work well, this is a great example and a great way for universities to participate."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "So what do you think it takes to build a system that wins the Alexa Prize?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "I think you have to start focusing on aspects of reasoning that it is, there are still more lookups of what intents customers asking for and responding to those rather than really reasoning about the elements of the conversation."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Like if you just said, I learned this fun fact about Tom Brady rather than really say how he played the game the previous night, then the conversation is not really that intelligent."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "So you have to go to more reasoning elements of understanding the context of the dialogue and giving more appropriate responses, which tells you that we are still quite far because a lot of times it's more facts being looked up and something that's close enough as an answer, but not really the answer."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So that is where the research needs to go more and actual true understanding and reasoning."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And that's why I feel it's a great way to do it because you have an engaged set of users working to help these AI advances happen in this case."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "You mentioned customers, they're quite a bit, and there's a skill."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "What is the experience for the user that's helping?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "So just to clarify, this isn't, as far as I understand, the Alexa, so this skill is a standalone for the Alexa Prize."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "I mean, it's focused on the Alexa Prize."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "It's not you ordering certain things on Amazon."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Like, oh, we're checking the weather or playing Spotify, right?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "This is a separate skill."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And so you're focused on helping that, I don't know, how do people, how do customers think of it?"}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Are they having fun?"}, {"time": 1429, "text": "Are they helping teach the system?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "What's the experience like?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "I think it's both actually."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And let me tell you how you invoke this skill."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So all you have to say, Alexa, let's chat."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "And then the first time you say, Alexa, let's chat, it comes back with a clear message that you're interacting with one of those university social bots."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "And there's a clear, so you know exactly how you interact, right?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And that is why it's very transparent."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "You are being asked to help, right?"}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And we have a lot of mechanisms where as we are in the first phase of feedback phase, then you send a lot of emails to our customers and then they know that the team needs a lot of interactions to improve the accuracy of the system."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "So we know we have a lot of customers who really want to help these university bots and they're conversing with that."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And some are just having fun with just saying, Alexa, let's chat."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And also some adversarial behavior to see whether, how much do you understand as a social bot?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So I think we have a good, healthy mix of all three situations."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "So what is the, if we talk about solving the Alexa challenge, the Alexa prize, what's the data set of really engaging, pleasant conversations look like?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Because if we think of this as a supervised learning problem, I don't know if it has to be, but if it does, maybe you can comment on that."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Do you think there needs to be a data set of what it means to be an engaging, successful, fulfilling conversation?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "I think that's part of the research question here."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "This was, I think, we at least got the first part right, which is have a way for universities to build and test in a real world setting."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "Now you're asking in terms of the next phase of questions, which we are still, we're also asking, by the way, what does success look like from a optimization function?"}, {"time": 1545, "text": "That's what you're asking in terms of, we as researchers are used to having a great corpus of annotated data and then making, then sort of tune our algorithms on those, right?"}, {"time": 1557, "text": "And fortunately and unfortunately, in this world of Alexa prize, that is not the way we are going after it."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So you have to focus more on learning based on life feedback."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "That is another element that's unique, where just not to, I started with giving you how you ingress and experience this capability as a customer."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "What happens when you're done?"}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So they ask you a simple question on a scale of one to five, how likely are you to interact with this social bot again?"}, {"time": 1591, "text": "That is a good feedback and customers can also leave more open ended feedback."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And I think partly that to me is one part of the question you're asking, which I'm saying is a mental model shift that as researchers also, you have to change your mindset that this is not a DARPA evaluation or NSF funded study and you have a nice corpus."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "This is where it's real world."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "You have real data."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "The scale is amazing and that's a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And then the customer, the user can quit the conversation at any time."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Exactly, the user can, that is also a signal for how good you were at that point."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "So, and then on a scale one to five, one to three, do they say how likely are you or is it just a binary?"}, {"time": 1638, "text": "One to five."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "Wow, okay, that's such a beautifully constructed challenge."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "You said the only way to make a smart assistant really smart is to give it eyes and let it explore the world."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "I'm not sure it might've been taken out of context, but can you comment on that?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Can you elaborate on that idea?"}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Is that I personally also find that idea super exciting from a social robotics, personal robotics perspective."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Yeah, a lot of things do get taken out of context."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "This particular one was just as philosophical discussion we were having on terms of what does intelligence look like?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And the context was in terms of learning, I think just we said we as humans are empowered with many different sensory abilities."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "I do believe that eyes are an important aspect of it in terms of if you think about how we as humans learn, it is quite complex and it's also not unimodal that you are fed a ton of text or audio and you just learn that way."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "No, you learn by experience, you learn by seeing, you're taught by humans and we are very efficient in how we learn."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Machines on the contrary are very inefficient on how they learn, especially these AIs."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "I think the next wave of research is going to be with less data, not just less human, not just with less labeled data, but also with a lot of weak supervision and where you can increase the learning rate."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "I don't mean less data in terms of not having a lot of data to learn from that we are generating so much data, but it is more about from a aspect of how fast can you learn?"}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So improving the quality of the data, the quality of data and the learning process."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "I think more on the learning process."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "I think we have to, we as humans learn with a lot of noisy data, right?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And I think that's the part that I don't think should change."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "What should change is how we learn, right?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So if you look at, you mentioned supervised learning, we have making transformative shifts from moving to more unsupervised, more weak supervision."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Those are the key aspects of how to learn."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "And I think in that setting, I hope you agree with me that having other senses is very crucial in terms of how you learn."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And from a machine learning perspective, which I hope we get a chance to talk to a few aspects that are fascinating there, but to stick on the point of sort of a body, an embodiment."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So Alexa has a body."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "It has a very minimalistic, beautiful interface where there's a ring and so on."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "I mean, I'm not sure of all the flavors of the devices that Alexa lives on, but there's a minimalistic basic interface."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And nevertheless, we humans, so I have a Roomba, I have all kinds of robots all over everywhere."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "So what do you think the Alexa of the future looks like if it begins to shift what his body looks like?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Maybe beyond the Alexa, what do you think are the different devices in the home as they start to embody their intelligence more and more?"}, {"time": 1836, "text": "What do you think that looks like?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Philosophically, a future, what do you think that looks like?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "I think let's look at what's happening today."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "You mentioned, I think our devices as an Amazon devices, but I also wanted to point out Alexa is already integrated a lot of third party devices, which also come in lots of forms and shapes, some in robots, some in microwaves, some in appliances that you use in everyday life."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So I think it's not just the shape Alexa takes in terms of form factors, but it's also where all it's available."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And it's getting in cars, it's getting in different appliances in homes, even toothbrushes, right?"}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So I think you have to think about it as not a physical assistant."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "It will be in some embodiment, as you said, we already have these nice devices, but I think it's also important to think of it, it is a virtual assistant."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "It is superhuman in the sense that it is in multiple places at the same time."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So I think the actual embodiment in some sense, to me doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "I think you have to think of it as not as human like and more of what its capabilities are that derive a lot of benefit for customers and how there are different ways to delight it and delight customers and different experiences."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And I think I'm a big fan of it not being just human like, it should be human like in certain situations."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "Alexa price social bot in terms of conversation is a great way to look at it, but there are other scenarios where human like, I think is underselling the abilities of this AI."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "So if I could trivialize what we're talking about."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So if you look at the way Steve Jobs thought about the interaction with the device that Apple produced, there was a extreme focus on controlling the experience by making sure there's only this Apple produced devices."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "You see the voice of Alexa being taking all kinds of forms depending on what the customers want."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And that means it could be anywhere from the microwave to a vacuum cleaner to the home and so on the voice is the essential element of the interaction."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "I think voice is an essence, it's not all, but it's a key aspect."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "I think to your question in terms of, you should be able to recognize Alexa and that's a huge problem."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I think in terms of a huge scientific problem, I should say like, what are the traits?"}, {"time": 1993, "text": "What makes it look like Alexa, especially in different settings and especially if it's primarily voice, what it is, but Alexa is not just voice either, right?"}, {"time": 2002, "text": "I mean, we have devices with a screen."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "Now you're seeing just other behaviors of Alexa."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So I think we're in very early stages of what that means and this will be an important topic for the following years."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "But I do believe that being able to recognize and tell when it's Alexa versus it's not is going to be important from an Alexa perspective."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "I'm not speaking for the entire AI community, but I think attribution and as we go into more of understanding who did what, that identity of the AI is crucial in the coming world."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "I think from the broad AI community perspective, that's also a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "So basically if I close my eyes and listen to the voice, what would it take for me to recognize that this is Alexa?"}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Or at least the Alexa that I've come to know from my personal experience in my home through my interactions that come through."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "Yeah, and the Alexa here in the US is very different than Alexa in UK and the Alexa in India, even though they are all speaking English or the Australian version."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So again, so now think about when you go into a different culture, a different community, but you travel there, what do you recognize Alexa?"}, {"time": 2071, "text": "I think these are super hard questions actually."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So there's a team that works on personality."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "So if we talk about those different flavors of what it means culturally speaking, India, UK, US, what does it mean to add?"}, {"time": 2084, "text": "So the problem that we just stated, it's just fascinating, how do we make it purely recognizable that it's Alexa, assuming that the qualities of the voice are not sufficient?"}, {"time": 2098, "text": "It's also the content of what is being said."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "How does the personality come into play?"}, {"time": 2104, "text": "What's that research gonna look like?"}, {"time": 2106, "text": "I mean, it's such a fascinating subject."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "We have some very fascinating folks who from both the UX background and human factors are looking at these aspects and these exact questions."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "But I'll definitely say it's not just how it sounds, the choice of words, the tone, not just, I mean, the voice identity of it, but the tone matters, the speed matters, how you speak, how you enunciate words, what choice of words are you using, how terse are you, or how lengthy in your explanations you are."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "All of these are factors."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And you also, you mentioned something crucial that you may have personalized it, Alexa, to some extent in your homes or in the devices you are interacting with."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So you, as your individual, how you prefer Alexa sounds can be different than how I prefer."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And the amount of customizability you want to give is also a key debate we always have."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "But I do want to point out it's more than the voice actor that recorded and it sounds like that actor."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "It is more about the choices of words, the attributes of tonality, the volume in terms of how you raise your pitch and so forth."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "All of that matters."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "This is such a fascinating problem from a product perspective."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "I could see those debates just happening inside of the Alexa team of how much personalization do you do for the specific customer?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "Because you're taking a risk if you over personalize."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Because you don't, if you create a personality for a million people, you can test that better."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "You can create a rich, fulfilling experience that will do well."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "But the more you personalize it, the less you can test it, the less you can know that it's a great experience."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "So how much personalization, what's the right balance?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "I think the right balance depends on the customer."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Give them the control."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "So I'll say, I think the more control you give customers, the better it is for everyone."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "And I'll give you some key personalization features."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "I think we have a feature called Remember This, which is where you can tell Alexa to remember something."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "There you have an explicit sort of control in customer's hand because they have to say, Alexa, remember X, Y, Z."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "What kind of things would that be used for?"}, {"time": 2248, "text": "So you can like you, I have stored my tire specs for my car because it's so hard to go and find and see what it is, right?"}, {"time": 2256, "text": "When you're having some issues."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "I store my mileage plan numbers for all the frequent flyer ones where I'm sometimes just looking at it and it's not handy."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "So those are my own personal choices I've made for Alexa to remember something on my behalf, right?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So again, I think the choice was be explicit about how you provide that to a customer as a control."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "So I think these are the aspects of what you do."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Like think about where we can use speaker recognition capabilities that it's, if you taught Alexa that you are Lex and this person in your household is person two, then you can personalize the experiences."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Again, these are very in the CX customer experience patterns are very clear about and transparent when a personalization action is happening."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "And then you have other ways like you go through explicit control right now through your app that your multiple service providers, let's say for music, which one is your preferred one."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "So when you say play sting, depend on your whether you have preferred Spotify or Amazon music or Apple music, that the decision is made where to play it from."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "So what's Alexa's backstory from her perspective?"}, {"time": 2332, "text": "Is there, I remember just asking as probably a lot of us are just the basic questions about love and so on of Alexa, just to see what the answer would be."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "It feels like there's a little bit of a personality but not too much."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "Is Alexa have a metaphysical presence in this human universe we live in or is it something more ambiguous?"}, {"time": 2363, "text": "Is there a past?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "Is there a birth?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Is there a family kind of idea even for joking purposes and so on?"}, {"time": 2371, "text": "I think, well, it does tell you if I think you, I should double check this but if you said when were you born, I think we do respond."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "I need to double check that but I'm pretty positive about it."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "I think you do actually because I think I've tested that."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "But that's like how I was born in your brand of champagne and whatever the year kind of thing, yeah."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So in terms of the metaphysical, I think it's early."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Does it have the historic knowledge about herself to be able to do that?"}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Maybe, have we crossed that boundary?"}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Not yet, right?"}, {"time": 2404, "text": "In terms of being, thank you."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Have we thought about it quite a bit but I wouldn't say that we have come to a clear decision in terms of what it should look like."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "But you can imagine though, and I bring this back to the Alexa Prize social bot one, there you will start seeing some of that."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Like these bots have their identity and in terms of that, you may find, this is such a great research topic that some academia team may think of these problems and start solving them too."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "So let me ask a question."}, {"time": 2438, "text": "It's kind of difficult, I think, but it feels, and fascinating to me because I'm fascinated with psychology."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "It feels that the more personality you have, the more dangerous it is in terms of a customer perspective of product."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "If you want to create a product that's useful."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "By dangerous, I mean creating an experience that upsets me."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And so how do you get that right?"}, {"time": 2466, "text": "Because if you look at the relationships, maybe I'm just a screwed up Russian, but if you look at the human to human relationship, some of our deepest relationships have fights, have tension, have the push and pull, have a little flavor in them."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Do you want to have such flavor in an interaction with Alexa?"}, {"time": 2488, "text": "So there's one other common thing that you didn't say, but we think of it as paramount for any deep relationship."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "That's trust."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Trust, yeah."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "So I think if you trust every attribute you said, a fight, some tension, is all healthy."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "But what is sort of unnegotiable in this instance is trust."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "And I think the bar to earn customer trust for AI is very high, in some sense, more than a human."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "It's not just about personal information or your data."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "It's also about your actions on a daily basis."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "How trustworthy are you in terms of consistency, in terms of how accurate are you in understanding me?"}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Like if you're talking to a person on the phone, if you have a problem with your, let's say your internet or something, if the person's not understanding, you lose trust right away."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "You don't want to talk to that person."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "That whole example gets amplified by a factor of 10, because when you're a human interacting with an AI, you have a certain expectation."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Either you expect it to be very intelligent and then you get upset, why is it behaving this way?"}, {"time": 2554, "text": "Or you expect it to be not so intelligent and when it surprises you, you're like, really, you're trying to be too smart?"}, {"time": 2560, "text": "So I think we grapple with these hard questions as well."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "But I think the key is actions need to be trustworthy."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "From these AIs, not just about data protection, your personal information protection, but also from how accurately it accomplishes all commands or all interactions."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Well, it's tough to hear because trust, you're absolutely right, but trust is such a high bar with AI systems because people, and I see this because I work with autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "I mean, the bar that's placed on AI system is unreasonably high."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Yeah, that is going to be, I agree with you."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "And I think of it as it's a challenge and it's also keeps my job, right?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "So from that perspective, I totally, I think of it at both sides as a customer and as a researcher."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "I think as a researcher, yes, occasionally it will frustrate me that why is the bar so high for these AIs?"}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And as a customer, then I say, absolutely, it has to be that high, right?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "So I think that's the trade off we have to balance, but it doesn't change the fundamentals."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "That trust has to be earned and the question then becomes is are we holding the AIs to a different bar in accuracy and mistakes than we hold humans?"}, {"time": 2636, "text": "That's going to be a great societal questions for years to come, I think for us."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "Well, one of the questions that we grapple as a society now that I think about a lot, I think a lot of people in the AI think about a lot and Alexis taking on head on is privacy."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "The reality is us giving over data to any AI system can be used to enrich our lives in profound ways."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So if basically any product that does anything awesome for you, the more data it has, the more awesome things it can do."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And yet on the other side, people imagine the worst case possible scenario of what can you possibly do with that data?"}, {"time": 2682, "text": "People, it's goes down to trust, as you said before."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "There's a fundamental distrust of, in certain groups of governments and so on."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "And depending on the government, depending on who's in power, depending on all these kinds of factors."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And so here's Alexa in the middle of all of it in the home, trying to do good things for the customers."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So how do you think about privacy in this context, the smart assistance in the home?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "How do you maintain, how do you earn trust?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "So as you said, trust is the key here."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "So you start with trust and then privacy is a key aspect of it."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "It has to be designed from very beginning about that."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "And we believe in two fundamental principles."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "One is transparency and second is control."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "So by transparency, I mean, when we build what is now called smart speaker or the first echo, we were quite judicious about making these right trade offs on customer's behalf, that it is pretty clear when the audio is being sent to cloud, the light ring comes on when it has heard you say the word wake word, and then the streaming happens, right?"}, {"time": 2749, "text": "So when the light ring comes up, we also had, we put a physical mute button on it, just so if you didn't want it to be listening, even for the wake word, then you turn the power button or the mute button on, and that disables the microphones."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "That's just the first decision on essentially transparency and control."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Oh, then even when we launched, we gave the control in the hands of the customers that you can go and look at any of your individual utterances that is recorded and delete them anytime."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "And we've got to true to that promise, right?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "So, and that is super, again, a great instance of showing how you have the control."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Then we made it even easier."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "You can say, like I said, delete what I said today."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So that is now making it even just more control in your hands with what's most convenient about this technology is voice."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "You delete it with your voice now."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "So these are the types of decisions we continually make."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "We just recently launched this feature called, what we think of it as, if you wanted humans not to review your data, because you've mentioned supervised learning, right?"}, {"time": 2819, "text": "So in supervised learning, humans have to give some annotation."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And that also is now a feature where you can essentially, if you've selected that flag, your data will not be reviewed by a human."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "So these are the types of controls that we have to constantly offer with customers."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "So why do you think it bothers people so much that, so everything you just said is really powerful."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So the control, the ability to delete, cause we collect, we have studies here running at MIT that collects huge amounts of data and people consent and so on."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "The ability to delete that data is really empowering and almost nobody ever asked to delete it, but the ability to have that control is really powerful."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But still, there's these popular anecdote, anecdotal evidence that people say, they like to tell that, them and a friend were talking about something, I don't know, sweaters for cats."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And all of a sudden they'll have advertisements for cat sweaters on Amazon."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "That's a popular anecdote as if something is always listening."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "What, can you explain that anecdote, that experience that people have?"}, {"time": 2889, "text": "What's the psychology of that?"}, {"time": 2891, "text": "What's that experience?"}, {"time": 2893, "text": "And can you, you've answered it, but let me just ask, is Alexa listening?"}, {"time": 2898, "text": "No, Alexa listens only for the wake word on the device."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "And the wake word is?"}, {"time": 2903, "text": "The words like Alexa, Amazon, Echo, but you only choose one at a time."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "So you choose one and it listens only for that on our devices."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So that's first."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "From a listening perspective, we have to be very clear that it's just the wake word."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "So you said, why is there this anxiety, if you may?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "It's because there's a lot of confusion, what it really listens to, right?"}, {"time": 2925, "text": "And I think it's partly on us to keep educating our customers and the general media more in terms of like how, what really happens."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And we've done a lot of it."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "And our pages on information are clear, but still people have to have more, there's always a hunger for information and clarity."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "And we'll constantly look at how best to communicate."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "If you go back and read everything, yes, it states exactly that."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "And then people could still question it."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And I think that's absolutely okay to question."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "What we have to make sure is that we are, because our fundamental philosophy is customer first, customer obsession is our leadership principle."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "If you put, as researchers, I put myself in the shoes of the customer, and all decisions in Amazon are made with that."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And trust has to be earned, and we have to keep earning the trust of our customers in this setting."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And to your other point on like, is there something showing up based on your conversations?"}, {"time": 2986, "text": "No, I think the answer is like, a lot of times when those experiences happen, you have to also know that, okay, it may be a winter season, people are looking for sweaters, right?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And it shows up on your amazon.com because it is popular."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "So there are many of these, you mentioned that personality or personalization, turns out we are not that unique either, right?"}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So those things we as humans start thinking, oh, must be because something was heard, and that's why this other thing showed up."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "The answer is no, probably it is just the season for sweaters."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "I'm not gonna ask you this question because people have so much paranoia."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "But let me just say from my perspective, I hope there's a day when customer can ask Alexa to listen all the time, to improve the experience, to improve because I personally don't see the negative because if you have the control and if you have the trust, there's no reason why I shouldn't be listening all the time to the conversations to learn more about you."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "Because ultimately, as long as you have control and trust, every data you provide to the device, that the device wants is going to be useful."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And so to me, as a machine learning person, I think it worries me how sensitive people are about their data relative to how empowering it could be relative to how empowering it could be for the devices around them, how enriching it could be for their own life to improve the product."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "So I just, it's something I think about sort of a lot, how do we make that devices, obviously Alexa thinks about a lot as well."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I don't know if you wanna comment on that, sort of, okay, have you seen, let me ask it in the form of a question, okay."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "Have you seen an evolution in the way people think about their private data in the previous several years?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So as we as a society get more and more comfortable to the benefits we get by sharing more data."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "First, let me answer that part and then I'll wanna go back to the other aspect you were mentioning."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So as a society, on a general, we are getting more comfortable as a society."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "Doesn't mean that everyone is, and I think we have to respect that."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "I don't think one size fits all is always gonna be the answer for all, right?"}, {"time": 3134, "text": "So I think that's something to keep in mind in these."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "Going back to your, on what more magical experiences can be launched in these kinds of AI settings."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "I think again, if you give the control, we, it's possible certain parts of it."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So we have a feature called follow up mode where you, if you turn it on and Alexa, after you've spoken to it, will open the mics again, thinking you will answer something again."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "Like if you're adding lists to your shopping item, so right, or a shopping list or to do list, you're not done."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "You want to keep, so in that setting, it's awesome that it opens the mic for you to say eggs and milk and then bread, right?"}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So these are the kinds of things which you can empower."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So, and then another feature we have, which is called Alexa Guard."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "I said it only listens for the wake word, right?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "But if you have, let's say you're going to say, like you leave your home and you want Alexa to listen for a couple of sound events like smoke alarm going off or someone breaking your glass, right?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "So it's like just to keep your peace of mind."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "So you can say Alexa on guard or I'm away and then it can be listening for these sound events."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "And when you're home, you come out of that mode, right?"}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So this is another one where you again gave controls in the hands of the user or the customer and to enable some experience that is high utility and maybe even more delightful in the certain settings like follow up mode and so forth."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "And again, this general principle is the same, control in the hands of the customer."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So I know we kind of started with a lot of philosophy and a lot of interesting topics and we're just jumping all over the place, but really some of the fascinating things that the Alexa team and Amazon is doing is in the algorithm side, the data side, the technology, the deep learning, machine learning and so on."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "So can you give a brief history of Alexa from the perspective of just innovation, the algorithms, the data of how it was born, how it came to be, how it's grown, where it is today?"}, {"time": 3262, "text": "Yeah, it start with in Amazon, everything starts with the customer and we have a process called working backwards."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "Alexa and more specifically than the product Echo, there was a working backwards document essentially that reflected what it would be, started with a very simple vision statement for instance that morphed into a full fledged document along the way changed into what all it can do, right?"}, {"time": 3291, "text": "But the inspiration was the Star Trek computer."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So when you think of it that way, everything is possible, but when you launch a product, you have to start with some place."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "And when I joined, the product was already in conception and we started working on the far field speech recognition because that was the first thing to solve."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "By that we mean that you should be able to speak to the device from a distance."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And in those days, that wasn't a common practice."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "And even in the previous research world I was in was considered to an unsolvable problem then in terms of whether you can converse from a length."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "And here I'm still talking about the first part of the problem where you say, get the attention of the device as in by saying what we call the wake word, which means the word Alexa has to be detected with a very high accuracy because it is a very common word."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "It has sound units that map with words like I like you or Alec, Alex, right?"}, {"time": 3351, "text": "So it's a undoubtedly hard problem to detect the right mentions of Alexa's address to the device versus I like Alexa."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So you have to pick up that signal when there's a lot of noise."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Not only noise but a lot of conversation in the house, right?"}, {"time": 3369, "text": "You remember on the device, you're simply listening for the wake word, Alexa."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And there's a lot of words being spoken in the house."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "How do you know it's Alexa and directed at Alexa?"}, {"time": 3381, "text": "Because I could say, I love my Alexa, I hate my Alexa."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "I want Alexa to do this."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And in all these three sentences, I said, Alexa, I didn't want it to wake up."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "Can I just pause on that second?"}, {"time": 3393, "text": "What would be your device that I should probably in the introduction of this conversation give to people in terms of them turning off their Alexa device if they're listening to this podcast conversation out loud?"}, {"time": 3409, "text": "Like what's the probability that an Alexa device will go off because we mentioned Alexa like a million times."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "So it will, we have done a lot of different things where we can figure out that there is the device, the speech is coming from a human versus over the air."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Also, I mean, in terms of like, also it is think about ads or so we have also launched a technology for watermarking kind of approaches in terms of filtering it out."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "But yes, if this kind of a podcast is happening, it's possible your device will wake up a few times."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "It's an unsolved problem, but it is definitely something we care very much about."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "But the idea is you wanna detect Alexa."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "Meant for the device."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "First of all, just even hearing Alexa versus I like something."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "I mean, that's a fascinating part."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "So that was the first relief."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "That's the first."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "The world's best detector of Alexa."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Yeah, the world's best wake word detector in a far field setting, not like something where the phone is sitting on the table."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "This is like people have devices 40 feet away like in my house or 20 feet away and you still get an answer."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "So that was the first part."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "The next is, okay, you're speaking to the device."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Of course, you're gonna issue many different requests."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "So this is like a common household setting where the words you're speaking to Alexa need to be recognized with very high accuracy, right?"}, {"time": 3523, "text": "Now we are still just in the recognition problem."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "We haven't yet come to the understanding one, right?"}, {"time": 3528, "text": "And if I pause them, sorry, once again, what year was this?"}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Is this before neural networks began to start to seriously prove themselves in the audio space?"}, {"time": 3540, "text": "Yeah, this is around, so I joined in 2013 in April, right?"}, {"time": 3545, "text": "So the early research and neural networks coming back and showing some promising results in speech recognition space had started happening, but it was very early."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "But we just now build on that on the very first thing we did when I joined with the team."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "And remember, it was a very much of a startup environment, which is great about Amazon."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "And we doubled down on deep learning right away."}, {"time": 3571, "text": "And we knew we'll have to improve accuracy fast."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "And because of that, we worked on, and the scale of data, once you have a device like this, if it is successful, will improve big time."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "Like you'll suddenly have large volumes of data to learn from to make the customer experience better."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "So how do you scale deep learning?"}, {"time": 3592, "text": "So we did one of the first works in training with distributed GPUs and where the training time was linear in terms of the amount of data."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "So that was quite important work where it was algorithmic improvements as well as a lot of engineering improvements to be able to train on thousands and thousands of speech."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "And that was an important factor."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So if you ask me like back in 2013 and 2014, when we launched Echo, the combination of large scale data, deep learning progress, near infinite GPUs we had available on AWS even then, was all came together for us to be able to solve the far field speech recognition to the extent it could be useful to the customers."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "It's still not solved."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "Like, I mean, it's not that we are perfect at recognizing speech, but we are great at it in terms of the settings that are in homes, right?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "So, and that was important even in the early stages."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "So first of all, just even, I'm trying to look back at that time."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "If I remember correctly, it was, it seems like the task would be pretty daunting."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "So like, so we kind of take it for granted that it works now."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "Yes, you're right."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So let me, like how, first of all, you mentioned startup."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "I wasn't familiar how big the team was."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "I kind of, cause I know there's a lot of really smart people working on it."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "So now it's a very, very large team."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "How big was the team?"}, {"time": 3680, "text": "How likely were you to fail in the eyes of everyone else?"}, {"time": 3684, "text": "And ourselves?"}, {"time": 3686, "text": "And yourself?"}, {"time": 3687, "text": "So like what?"}, {"time": 3688, "text": "I'll give you a very interesting anecdote on that."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "When I joined the team, the speech recognition team was six people."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "My first meeting, and we had hired a few more people, it was 10 people."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "Nine out of 10 people thought it can't be done."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "Who was the one?"}, {"time": 3710, "text": "The one was me, say, actually I should say, and one was semi optimistic."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "And eight were trying to convince, let's go to the management and say, let's not work on this problem."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Let's work on some other problem, like either telephony speech for customer service calls and so forth."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "But this was the kind of belief you must have."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "And I had experience with far field speech recognition and my eyes lit up when I saw a problem like that saying, okay, we have been in speech recognition, always looking for that killer app."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "And this was a killer use case to bring something delightful in the hands of customers."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "So you mentioned the way you kind of think of it in the product way in the future, have a press release and an FAQ and you think backwards."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "Did you have, did the team have the echo in mind?"}, {"time": 3761, "text": "So this far field speech recognition, actually putting a thing in the home that works, that it's able to interact with, was that the press release?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "What was the?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "The way close, I would say, in terms of the, as I said, the vision was start a computer, right?"}, {"time": 3775, "text": "Or the inspiration."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And from there, I can't divulge all the exact specifications, but one of the first things that was magical on Alexa was music."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "It brought me to back to music because my taste was still in when I was an undergrad."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "So I still listened to those songs and I, it was too hard for me to be a music fan with a phone, right?"}, {"time": 3801, "text": "So I, and I don't, I hate things in my ears."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "So from that perspective, it was quite hard and music was part of the, at least the documents I have seen, right?"}, {"time": 3813, "text": "So from that perspective, I think, yes, in terms of how far are we from the original vision?"}, {"time": 3820, "text": "I can't reveal that, but it's, that's why I have done a fun at work because every day we go in and thinking like, these are the new set of challenges to solve."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "Yeah, that's a great way to do great engineering as you think of the press release."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "I like that idea actually."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Maybe we'll talk about it a bit later, but it's just a super nice way to have a focus."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "I'll tell you this, you're a scientist and a lot of my scientists have adopted that."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "They have now, they love it as a process because it was very, as scientists, you're trained to write great papers, but they are all after you've done the research or you've proven that and your PhD dissertation proposal is something that comes closest or a DARPA proposal or a NSF proposal is the closest that comes to a press release."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "But that process is now ingrained in our scientists, which is like delightful for me to see."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "You write the paper first and then make it happen."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "In fact, it's not."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "State of the art results."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "Or you leave the results section open where you have a thesis about here's what I expect, right?"}, {"time": 3881, "text": "And here's what it will change, right?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So I think it is a great thing."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "It works for researchers as well."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "So far field recognition."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "What was the big leap?"}, {"time": 3893, "text": "What were the breakthroughs and what was that journey like to today?"}, {"time": 3898, "text": "Yeah, I think the, as you said first, there was a lot of skepticism on whether far field speech recognition will ever work to be good enough, right?"}, {"time": 3906, "text": "And what we first did was got a lot of training data in a far field setting."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "And that was extremely hard to get because none of it existed."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So how do you collect data in far field setup, right?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "With no customer base at this time."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "With no customer base, right?"}, {"time": 3922, "text": "So that was first innovation."}, {"time": 3924, "text": "And once we had that, the next thing was, okay, if you have the data, first of all, we didn't talk about like, what would magical mean in this kind of a setting?"}, {"time": 3935, "text": "What is good enough for customers, right?"}, {"time": 3937, "text": "That's always, since you've never done this before, what would be magical?"}, {"time": 3941, "text": "So it wasn't just a research problem."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "You had to put some in terms of accuracy and customer experience features, some stakes on the ground saying, here's where I think it should get to."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So you established a bar and then how do you measure progress towards given you have no customer right now."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "So from that perspective, we went, so first was the data without customers."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Second was doubling down on deep learning as a way to learn."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "And I can just tell you that the combination of the two got our error rates by a factor of five."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "From where we were when I started to within six months of having that data, we, at that point, I got the conviction that this will work, right?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "So, because that was magical in terms of when it started working and."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "That reached the magical bar."}, {"time": 3996, "text": "That came close to the magical bar."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "To the bar, right?"}, {"time": 3999, "text": "That we felt would be where people will use it."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "That was critical."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "Because you really have one chance at this."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "If we had launched in November 2014 is when we launched, if it was below the bar, I don't think this category exists if you don't meet the bar."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Yeah, and just having looked at voice based interactions like in the car or earlier systems, it's a source of huge frustration for people."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "In fact, we use voice based interaction for collecting data on subjects to measure frustration."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "So, as a training set for computer vision, for face data, so we can get a data set of frustrated people."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "That's the best way to get frustrated people is having them interact with a voice based system in the car."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "So, that bar I imagine is pretty high."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "It was very high."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "And we talked about how also errors are perceived from AIs versus errors by humans."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "But we are not done with the problems that ended up, we had to solve to get it to launch."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "So, do you want the next one?"}, {"time": 4061, "text": "Yeah, the next one."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "So, the next one was what I think of as multi domain natural language understanding."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And again, no customer base yet."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "Again, no customer base."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "So, now you're looking at meaning understanding and intent understanding and taking actions on behalf of customers."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "Based on their requests."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "And that is the next hard problem."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "Even if you have gotten the words recognized, how do you make sense of them?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "In those days, there was still a lot of emphasis on rule based systems for writing grammar patterns to understand the intent."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "But we had a statistical first approach even then, where for our language understanding we had, and even those starting days, an entity recognizer and an intent classifier, which was all trained statistically."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "In fact, we had to build the deterministic matching as a follow up to fix bugs that statistical models have."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "So, it was just a different mindset where we focused on data driven statistical understanding."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "It wins in the end if you have a huge data set."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Yes, it is contingent on that."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And that's why it came back to how do you get the data."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "Before customers, the fact that this is why data becomes crucial to get to the point that you have the understanding system built up."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And notice that for you, we were talking about human machine dialogue, and even those early days, even it was very much transactional, do one thing, one shot utterances in great way."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "There was a lot of debate on how much should Alexa talk back in terms of if you misunderstood it."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "If you misunderstood you or you said play songs by the stones, and let's say it doesn't know early days, knowledge can be sparse, who are the stones?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "It's the Rolling Stones."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And you don't want the match to be Stone Temple Pilots or Rolling Stones."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "So, you don't know which one it is."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "So, these kind of other signals, now there we had great assets from Amazon in terms of... UX, like what is it, what kind of... Yeah, how do you solve that problem?"}, {"time": 4231, "text": "In terms of what we think of it as an entity resolution problem, right?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "So, because which one is it, right?"}, {"time": 4236, "text": "I mean, even if you figured out the stones as an entity, you have to resolve it to whether it's the stones or the Stone Temple Pilots or some other stones."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Maybe I misunderstood, is the resolution the job of the algorithm or is the job of UX communicating with the human to help the resolution?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "Well, there is both, right?"}, {"time": 4254, "text": "It is, you want 90% or high 90s to be done without any further questioning or UX, right?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "So, but it's absolutely okay, just like as humans, we ask the question, I didn't understand you, Lex."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "It's fine for Alexa to occasionally say, I did not understand you, right?"}, {"time": 4272, "text": "And that's an important way to learn."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "And I'll talk about where we have come with more self learning with these kind of feedback signals."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "But in those days, just solving the ability of understanding the intent and resolving to an action where action could be play a particular artist or a particular song was super hard."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Again, the bar was high as we were talking about, right?"}, {"time": 4295, "text": "So, while we launched it in sort of 13 big domains, I would say in terms of, we think of it as 13, the big skills we had, like music is a massive one when we launched it."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And now we have 90,000 plus skills on Alexa."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "So, what are the big skills?"}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Can you just go over them?"}, {"time": 4313, "text": "Because the only thing I use it for is music, weather and shopping."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "So, we think of it as music information, right?"}, {"time": 4322, "text": "So, weather is a part of information, right?"}, {"time": 4325, "text": "So, when we launched, we didn't have smart home, but within, by smart home I mean, you connect your smart devices, you control them with voice."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "If you haven't done it, it's worth, it will change your life."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "Like turning on the lights and so on."}, {"time": 4336, "text": "Turning on your light to anything that's connected and has a, it's just that."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "What's your favorite smart device for you?"}, {"time": 4343, "text": "My light."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "And now you have the smart plug with, and you don't, we also have this echo plug, which is."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "Oh yeah, you can plug in anything."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "You can plug in anything and now you can turn that one on and off."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "I use this conversation motivation to get one."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Garage door, you can check your status of the garage door and things like, and we have gone, make Alexa more and more proactive, where it even has hunches now, that, oh, looks, hunches, like you left your light on."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Let's say you've gone to your bed and you left the garage light on."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "So it will help you out in these settings, right?"}, {"time": 4376, "text": "That's smart devices, information, smart devices."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "You said music."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "Yeah, so I don't remember everything we had, but alarms, timers were the big ones."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Like that was, you know, the timers were very popular right away."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "Music also, like you could play song, artist, album, everything, and so that was like a clear win in terms of the customer experience."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "So that's, again, this is language understanding."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "Now things have evolved, right?"}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So where we want Alexa definitely to be more accurate, competent, trustworthy, based on how well it does these core things, but we have evolved in many different dimensions."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "First is what I think of are doing more conversational for high utility, not just for chat, right?"}, {"time": 4420, "text": "And there at Remars this year, which is our AI conference, we launched what is called Alexa Conversations."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "That is providing the ability for developers to author multi turn experiences on Alexa with no code, essentially, in terms of the dialogue code."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Initially it was like, you know, all these IVR systems, you have to fully author if the customer says this, do that, right?"}, {"time": 4447, "text": "So the whole dialogue flow is hand authored."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "And with Alexa Conversations, the way it is that you just provide a sample interaction data with your service or your API, let's say your Atom tickets that provides a service for buying movie tickets."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "You provide a few examples of how your customers will interact with your APIs."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "And then the dialogue flow is automatically constructed using a record neural network trained on that data."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So that simplifies the developer experience."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "We just launched our preview for the developers to try this capability out."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "And then the second part of it, which shows even increased utility for customers is you and I, when we interact with Alexa or any customer, as I'm coming back to our initial part of the conversation, the goal is often unclear or unknown to the AI."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "If I say, Alexa, what movies are playing nearby?"}, {"time": 4502, "text": "Am I trying to just buy movie tickets?"}, {"time": 4507, "text": "Am I actually even, do you think I'm looking for just movies for curiosity, whether the Avengers is still in theater or when is it?"}, {"time": 4515, "text": "Maybe it's gone and maybe it will come on my missed it."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "So I may watch it on Prime, right?"}, {"time": 4520, "text": "Which happened to me."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "So from that perspective now, you're looking into what is my goal?"}, {"time": 4527, "text": "And let's say I now complete the movie ticket purchase."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Maybe I would like to get dinner nearby."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So what is really the goal here?"}, {"time": 4538, "text": "Is it night out or is it movies?"}, {"time": 4541, "text": "As in just go watch a movie?"}, {"time": 4544, "text": "The answer is, we don't know."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "So can Alexa now figuratively have the intelligence that I think this meta goal is really night out or at least say to the customer when you've completed the purchase of movie tickets from Atom tickets or Fandango, or pick your anyone."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Then the next thing is, do you want to get an Uber to the theater, right?"}, {"time": 4569, "text": "Or do you want to book a restaurant next to it?"}, {"time": 4572, "text": "And then not ask the same information over and over again, what time, how many people in your party, right?"}, {"time": 4582,

action to complete it."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "Now that's the machine learning problem."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "But essentially the way we solve this first instance, and we have a long way to go to make it scale to everything possible in the world."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "But at least for this situation, it is from at every instance, Alexa is making the determination, whether it should stick with the experience with Atom tickets or not."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "Or offer you based on what you say, whether either you have completed the interaction, or you said, no, get me an Uber now."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "So it will shift context into another experience or skill or another service."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "So that's a dynamic decision making."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "That's making Alexa, you can say more conversational for the benefit of the customer, rather than simply complete transactions, which are well thought through."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "You as a customer has fully specified what you want to be accomplished."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "It's accomplishing that."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "So it's kind of as we do this with pedestrians, like intent modeling is predicting what your possible goals are and what's the most likely goal and switching that depending on the things you say."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "So my question is there, it seems maybe it's a dumb question, but it would help a lot if Alexa remembered me, what I said previously."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "Is it trying to use some memories for the customer?"}, {"time": 4678, "text": "Yeah, it is using a lot of memory within that."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "So right now, not so much in terms of, okay, which restaurant do you prefer, right?"}, {"time": 4685, "text": "That is a more longterm memory, but within the short term memory, within the session, it is remembering how many people did you, so if you said buy four tickets, now it has made an implicit assumption that you were gonna have, you need at least four seats at a restaurant, right?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "So these are the kind of context it's preserving between these skills, but within that session."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "But you're asking the right question in terms of for it to be more and more useful, it has to have more longterm memory and that's also an open question and again, these are still early days."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "So for me, I mean, everybody's different, but yeah, I'm definitely not representative of the general population in the sense that I do the same thing every day."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "Like I eat the same, I do everything the same, the same thing, wear the same thing clearly, this or the black shirt."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "So it's frustrating when Alexa doesn't get what I'm saying because I have to correct her every time in the exact same way."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "This has to do with certain songs, like she doesn't know certain weird songs I like and doesn't know, I've complained to Spotify about this, talked to the RD, head of RD at Spotify, it's their way to heaven."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "I have to correct it every time."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "It doesn't play Led Zeppelin correctly."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "It plays cover of Led's of Stairway to Heaven."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "So I'm."}, {"time":

everybody retweet it."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "We're gonna fix the Stairway to Heaven problem."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "Anyway, but the point is, you know, I'm pretty boring and do the same things, but I'm sure most people do the same set of things."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "Do you see Alexa sort of utilizing that in the future for improving the experience?"}, {"time": 4792, "text": "Yes, and not only utilizing, it's already doing some of it."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "We call it, where Alexa is becoming more self learning."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "So, Alexa is now auto correcting millions and millions of utterances in the US without any human supervision involved."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "The way it does it is, let's take an example of a particular song didn't work for you."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "What do you do next?"}, {"time": 4815, "text": "You either it played the wrong song and you said, Alexa, no, that's not the song I want."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "Or you say, Alexa play that, you try it again."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "And that is a signal to Alexa that she may have done something wrong."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "And from that perspective, we can learn if there's that failure pattern or that action of song A was played when song B was requested."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "And it's very common with station names because play NPR, you can have N be confused as an M. And then you, for a certain accent like mine, people confuse my N and M all the time."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "And because I have a Indian accent, they're confusable to humans."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "It is for Alexa too."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "And in that part, but it starts auto correcting and we collect, we correct a lot of these automatically without a human looking at the failures."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "So one of the things that's for me missing in Alexa, I don't know if I'm a representative customer, but every time I correct it, it would be nice to know that that made a difference."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Like the sort of like, I heard you like a sort of."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "Some acknowledgement of that."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "We work a lot with Tesla, we study autopilot and so on."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "And a large amount of the customers that use Tesla autopilot, they feel like they're always teaching the system."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "They're almost excited by the possibility that they're teaching."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "I don't know if Alexa customers generally think of it as they're teaching to improve the system."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "And that's a really powerful thing."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "Again, I would say it's a spectrum."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "Some customers do think that way and some would be annoyed by Alexa acknowledging that."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "So there's, again, no one, while there are certain patterns, not everyone is the same in this way."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "But we believe that, again, customers helping Alexa is a tenet for us in terms of improving it."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "And some more self learning is by, again, this is like fully unsupervised, right?"}, {"time": 4940, "text": "There is no human in the loop and no labeling happening."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "And based on your actions as a customer, Alexa becomes smarter."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "Again, it's early days, but I think this whole area of teachable AI is gonna get bigger and bigger in the whole space, especially in the AI assistant space."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "So that's the second part where I mentioned more conversational."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "This is more self learning."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "The third is more natural."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "And the way I think of more natural is we talked about how Alexa sounds."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "And we have done a lot of advances in our text to speech by using, again, neural network technology for it to sound very humanlike."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "From the individual texture of the sound to the timing, the tonality, the tone, everything, the whole thing."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "I would think in terms of, there's a lot of controls in each of the places for how, I mean, the speed of the voice, the prosthetic patterns, the actual smoothness of how it sounds, all of those are factored and we do a ton of listening tests to make sure."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "But naturalness, how it sounds should be very natural."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "How it understands requests is also very important."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "And in terms of, we have 95,000 skills."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "And if we have, imagine that in many of these skills, you have to remember the skill name and say, Alexa, ask the tide skill to tell me X."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "Now, if you have to remember the skill name, that means the discovery and the interaction is unnatural."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "And we are trying to solve that by what we think of as, again, you don't have to have the app metaphor here."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "These are not individual apps, right?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "Even though they're, so you're not sort of opening one at a time and interacting."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "So it should be seamless because it's voice."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "And when it's voice, you have to be able to understand these requests independent of the specificity, like a skill name."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And to do that, what we have done is again, built a deep learning based capability where we shortlist a bunch of skills when you say, Alexa, get me a car."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "And then we figure it out, okay, it's meant for an Uber skill versus a Lyft or based on your preferences."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "And then you can rank the responses from the skill and then choose the best response for the customer."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "So that's on the more natural, other examples of more natural is like, we were talking about lists, for instance, and you don't wanna say, Alexa, add milk, Alexa, add eggs, Alexa, add cookies."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "No, Alexa, add cookies, milk, and eggs and that in one shot, right?"}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So that works, that helps with the naturalness."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "We talked about memory, like if you said, you can say, Alexa, remember I have to go to mom's house, or you may have entered a calendar event through your calendar that's linked to Alexa."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "You don't wanna remember whether it's in my calendar or did I tell you to remember something or some other reminder, right?"}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So you have to now, independent of how customers create these events, it should just say, Alexa, when do I have to go to mom's house?"}, {"time": 5129, "text": "And it tells you when you have to go to mom's house."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "Now that's a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "Who's that problem on?"}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So there's people who create skills."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Who's tasked with integrating all of that knowledge together so the skills become seamless?"}, {"time": 5144, "text": "Is it the creators of the skills or is it an infrastructure that Alexa provides problem?"}, {"time": 5151, "text": "It's both."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "I think the large problem in terms of making sure your skill quality is high, that has to be done by our tools, because it's just, so these skills, just to put the context, they are built through Alexa Skills Kit, which is a self serve way of building an experience on Alexa."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "This is like any developer in the world could go to Alexa Skills Kit and build an experience on Alexa."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "Like if you're a Domino's, you can build a Domino's Skills."}, {"time": 5180, "text": "For instance, that does pizza ordering."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "When you have authored that, you do want to now, if people say, Alexa, open Domino's or Alexa, ask Domino's to get a particular type of pizza, that will work, but the discovery is hard."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "You can't just say, Alexa, get me a pizza."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "And then Alexa figures out what to do."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "That latter part is definitely our responsibility in terms of when the request is not fully specific, how do you figure out what's the best skill or a service that can fulfill the customer's request?"}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And it can keep evolving."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "Imagine going to the situation I said, which was the night out planning, that the goal could be more than that individual request that came up."}, {"time": 5225, "text": "A pizza ordering could mean a night in, where you're having an event with your kids in their house, and you're, so this is, welcome to the world of conversational AI."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "This is super exciting because it's not the academic problem of NLP, of natural language processing, understanding, dialogue."}, {"time": 5243, "text": "This is like real world."}, {"time": 5244, "text": "And the stakes are high in the sense that customers get frustrated quickly, people get frustrated quickly."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "So you have to get it right, you have to get that interaction right."}, {"time": 5255, "text": "So it's, I love it."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "But so from that perspective, what are the challenges today?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "What are the problems that really need to be solved in the next few years?"}, {"time": 5265, "text": "What's the focus?"}, {"time": 5266, "text": "First and foremost, as I mentioned, that get the basics right is still true."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "Basically, even the one shot requests, which we think of as transactional requests, needs to work magically, no question about that."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "If it doesn't turn your light on and off, you'll be super frustrated."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "Even if I can complete the night out for you and not do that, that is unacceptable as a customer, right?"}, {"time": 5290, "text": "So that you have to get the foundational understanding going very well."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "The second aspect when I said more conversational is as you imagine is more about reasoning."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "It is really about figuring out what the latent goal is of the customer based on what I have the information now and the history, what's the next best thing to do."}, {"time": 5311, "text": "So that's a complete reasoning and decision making problem."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "Just like your self driving car, but the goal is still more finite."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "Here it evolves, your environment is super hard and self driving and the cost of a mistake is huge here, but there are certain similarities."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "But if you think about how many decisions Alexa is making or evaluating at any given time, it's a huge hypothesis space."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "And we're only talked about so far about what I think of reactive decision in terms of you asked for something and Alexa is reacting to it."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "If you bring the proactive part, which is Alexa having hunches."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "So any given instance then it's really a decision at any given point based on the information."}, {"time": 5357, "text": "Alexa has to determine what's the best thing it needs to do."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "So these are the ultimate AI problem about decisions based on the information you have."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "Do you think, just from my perspective, I work a lot with sensing of the human face."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "Do you think they'll, and we touched this topic a little bit earlier, but do you think it'll be a day soon when Alexa can also look at you to help improve the quality of the hunch it has, or at least detect frustration or detect, improve the quality of its perception of what you're trying to do?"}, {"time": 5394, "text": "I mean, let me again bring back to what it already does."}, {"time": 5397, "text": "We talked about how based on you barge in over Alexa, clearly it's a very high probability it must have done something wrong."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "That's why you barged in."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "The next extension of whether frustration is a signal or not, of course, is a natural thought in terms of how that should be in a signal to it."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "You can get that from voice."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "You can get from voice, but it's very hard."}, {"time": 5421, "text": "Like, I mean, frustration as a signal historically, if you think about emotions of different kinds, there's a whole field of affective computing, something that MIT has also done a lot of research in, is super hard."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "And you are now talking about a far field device, as in you're talking to a distance noisy environment."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "And in that environment, it needs to have a good sense for your emotions."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "This is a very, very hard problem."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "Very hard problem, but you haven't shied away from hard problems."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "So, Deep Learning has been at the core of a lot of this technology."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "Are you optimistic about the current Deep Learning approaches to solving the hardest aspects of what we're talking about?"}, {"time": 5463, "text": "Or do you think there will come a time where new ideas need to further, if we look at reasoning, so OpenAI, DeepMind, a lot of folks are now starting to work in reasoning, trying to see how we can make neural networks reason."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "Do you see that new approaches need to be invented to take the next big leap?"}, {"time": 5483, "text": "Absolutely, I think there has to be a lot more investment."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "And I think in many different ways, and there are these, I would say, nuggets of research forming in a good way, like learning with less data or like zero short learning, one short learning."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "And the active learning stuff you've talked about is incredible stuff."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "So, transfer learning is also super critical, especially when you're thinking about applying knowledge from one task to another, or one language to another, right?"}, {"time": 5512, "text": "It's really ripe."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "So, these are great pieces."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "Deep learning has been useful too."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And now we are sort of marrying deep learning with transfer learning and active learning."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Of course, that's more straightforward in terms of applying deep learning and an active learning setup."}, {"time": 5526, "text": "But I do think in terms of now looking into more reasoning based approaches is going to be key for our next wave of the technology."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "But there is a good news."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "The good news is that I think for keeping on to delight customers, that a lot of it can be done by prediction tasks."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "So, we haven't exhausted that."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "So, we don't need to give up on the deep learning approaches for that."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So, that's just I wanted to sort of point that out."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "Creating a rich, fulfilling, amazing experience that makes Amazon a lot of money and a lot of everybody a lot of money because it does awesome things, deep learning is enough."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "The point."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "I don't think, I wouldn't say deep learning is enough."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "I think for the purposes of Alexa accomplished the task for customers."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "I'm saying there are still a lot of things we can do with prediction based approaches that do not reason."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "I'm not saying that and we haven't exhausted those."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "But for the kind of high utility experiences that I'm personally passionate about of what Alexa needs to do, reasoning has to be solved to the same extent as you can think of natural language understanding and speech recognition to the extent of understanding intents has been how accurate it has become."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "But reasoning, we have very, very early days."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "Let me ask it another way."}, {"time": 5614, "text": "How hard of a problem do you think that is?"}, {"time": 5616, "text": "Hardest of them."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "I would say hardest of them because again, the hypothesis space is really, really large."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And when you go back in time, like you were saying, I wanna, I want Alexa to remember more things that once you go beyond a session of interaction, which is by session, I mean a time span, which is today to versus remembering which restaurant I like."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "And then when I'm planning a night out to say, do you wanna go to the same restaurant?"}, {"time": 5647, "text": "Now you're up the stakes big time."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "And this is where the reasoning dimension also goes way, way bigger."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "So you think the space, we'll be elaborating that a little bit, just philosophically speaking, do you think when you reason about trying to model what the goal of a person is in the context of interacting with Alexa, you think that space is huge?"}, {"time": 5671, "text": "It's huge, absolutely huge."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "Do you think, so like another sort of devil's advocate would be that we human beings are really simple and we all want like just a small set of things."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "And so do you think it's possible?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "Cause we're not talking about a fulfilling general conversation."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "Perhaps actually the Alexa prize is a little bit after that."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "Creating a customer, like there's so many of the interactions, it feels

may wanna accomplish."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "But the tail is long and it's diverse, right?"}, {"time": 5718, "text": "So from that."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "There's many, many long tails."},

of the skills, right?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "I mean, if you're an average surfer, which I am not, right?"}, {"time": 5736, "text": "But somebody is asking Alexa about surfing conditions, right?"},

like what kind of skills people have created, it's humongous in terms of it."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And which means there are these diverse needs."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "And when you start looking at the combinations of these, right?"}, {"time": 5760, "text": "Even if you had pairs of skills and 90,000 choose two, it's still a big set of combinations."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "So I'm saying there's a huge to do here now."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "And I think customers are, you know, wonderfully frustrated with things."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "And they have to keep getting to do better things for them."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "And they're not known to be super patient."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "So you have to."}, {"time": 5784, "text": "Do it fast."}, {"time": 5785,

years back, will Alexa will be here?"}, {"time": 5844, "text": "I wouldn't have, I think it has surpassed my imagination of that time, right?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So I think from the next five

what else do you got?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "You can collect data, right?"}, {"time": 977, "text": "And you can try to match the data."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Or another thing that you can do is

quite interesting actually, like how we how we interact with things versus we interact with humans."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Like so if, if you see a vehicle that's completely empty and it's trying to do something, all of a sudden it becomes a thing."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So interacted with like you interact with this table and so you can throw your backpack or you can kick your, kick it,

actually understand, like if someone is going to be aggressive or, or not as a robot and you can make certain decisions."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "Well, in terms of predicting what they're going to

them that they're very sustainable, but ultimately the sustainability efficiency trade offs, like they're going to be right in there and we're going to have to make some choices."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Like we're not going to be able to just kind of put it aside."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So for example, we can be very aggressive and we can reduce transportation delays, increase capacity of transportation, or we can be a lot nicer and allow other people to kind of quote unquote own the environment and live in a nice place and then efficiency will drop."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "So when you think about it, I think sustainability gets attached to energy consumption or environmental impact immediately."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "And those are there, but like livability is another sustainability impact."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So you create an environment that people want to live in."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And if, if, if robots are going around being aggressive and you don't want to live in that environment, maybe, however, you should note that if you're not being aggressive, then, you know, you're probably taking up some, some delays in transportation and this and that."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So you're always balancing that."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "And I think this, this choice has always been there in transportation, but I think the more autonomy comes in, the more explicit the choice becomes."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And when it becomes explicit, then we can start to optimize it and then we'll get to ask the very difficult societal questions of what do we value more, efficiency or sustainability?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "It's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I think we're going to have to like, I think that the interesting thing about like the whole autonomous vehicles question, I think is also kind of, um, I think a lot of times, you know, we have, we have focused on technology development, like hundreds of years and you know, the products somehow followed and then, you know, we got to make these choices and things like that."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So this is, this is a good time that, you know, we even think about, you know, autonomous taxi type of deployments and the systems that would evolve from there."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And you realize the business models are different."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "The impact on architecture is different, urban planning, you get into like regulations, um, and then you get into like these issues that you didn't think about before, but like sustainability and ethics is like right in the middle of it."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "I mean, even testing autonomous vehicles, like think about it, you're testing autonomous vehicles in human present environments."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "I mean, uh, the risk may be very small, but still, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's, it's a, you know, strictly greater than zero risk that you're putting people into."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And so then you have that innovation, you know, risk trade off that you're, you're in that somewhere."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "Um, and we, we understand that pretty now that pretty well now is that if we don't test the, at least the, the development will be slower."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I mean, it doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to develop."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "I think it's going to be pretty hard actually."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Maybe we can, we don't, we don't, I don't know."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "But the thing is that those kinds of trade offs we already are making and as these systems become more ubiquitous, I think those trade offs will just really hit."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So you are one of the founders of Optimus Ride and autonomous vehicle company."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "We'll talk about it, but let me on that point ask maybe a good examples, keeping Optimus Ride out, out of this question, uh, sort of exemplars of different strategies on the spectrum of innovation and safety or caution."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So like Waymo, Google self driving car Waymo represents maybe a more cautious approach."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And then you have Tesla on the other side headed by Elon Musk that represents a more, however, which adjective you want to use, aggressive, innovative, I don't know."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But uh, what, what do you think about the difference in the two strategies in your view?"}, {"time": 1521, "text": "What's more likely, what's needed and is more likely to succeed in the short term and in the long term?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Definitely some sort of a balance is, is kind of the right way to go."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "But I do think that the thing that is the most important is actually like an informed public."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "So I don't, I don't mind, you know, I personally, like if I were in some place, I wouldn't mind so much like taking a certain amount of risk, um, some other people might."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And so I think the key is for people to be informed and so that they can, ideally they can make a choice."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "In some cases, that kind of choice, um, making that unanimously is of course very hard."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "But I don't think it's actually that hard to inform people."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "So I think in, in, in one case, like for example, even the Tesla approach, um, I don't know, it's hard to judge how informed it is, but it is somewhat informed."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "I mean, you know, things kind of come out."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "I think people know what they're taking and things like that and so on."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "But I think the, the underlying, um, I do think that these two companies are a little bit kind of representing like the, of course they, you know, one of them seems a bit safer or the other one, or, you know, um, whatever the objective for that is, and the other one seems more aggressive or whatever the objective for that is."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "But, but I think, you know, when you turn the tables, they're actually, there are two other orthogonal dimensions that these two are focusing on."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "On the one hand for Waymo, I can see that, you know, they're, I mean, um, they, I think they a little bit see it as research as well."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "So they kind of, they don't, I'm not sure if they're like really interested in like an immediate, um, product, um, you know, they, they talk about it."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "Um, sometimes there's some pressure to talk about it."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So they, they kind of go for it, but I think, um, I think that they're thinking, um, maybe in the back of their minds, maybe they don't put it this way, but I think they, they realize that we're building like a new engine."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "It's kind of like call it the AI engine or whatever that is."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And you know, an autonomous vehicles is a very interesting embodiment of that engine that allows you to understand where the ego vehicle is, the ego thing is where everything else is, what everything else is going to do and how do you react, how do you actually, you know, interact with humans the right way?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "How do you build these systems?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And I think, uh, they, they want to know that they want to understand that."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And so they keep going and doing that."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And so on the other dimension, Tesla is doing something interesting."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "I mean, I think that they have a good product."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "People use it."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "I think that, you know, like it's, it's not for me, um, but I can totally see people, people like it and, and people, I think they have a good product outside of automation, but I was just referring to the, the, the automation itself."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I mean, you know, like it, it kind of drives itself."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "You still have to be kind of, um, you still have to pay attention to it, right?"}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Well, you know, um, people seem to use it."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "So it works for something."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "And so people, I think people are willing to pay for it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "People are willing to buy it."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "I think it, uh, it's, it's one of the other reasons why people buy a Tesla car."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk is the CEO and you know, he seems like a visionary person."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "That's what people think."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "He's a great person."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And so that adds like 5k to the value of the car and then maybe another 5k is the autopilot and, and you know, it's, it's useful."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "I mean, it's, um, useful in the sense that like people are using it."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And so I can see Tesla and sure, of course they want to be visionary."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "They want to kind of put out a certain approach and they may actually get there."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "Um, but I think that there's also a primary benefit of doing all these updates and rolling it out because, you know, people pay for it and it's, it's, you know, it's basic, you know, demand, supply market and people like it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "They're happy to pay another 5k, 10k for that novelty or whatever that is, um, they, and they use it."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "It's not like they get it and they try it a couple of times as a novelty, but they use it a lot of the time."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And so I think that's what Tesla is doing."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "It's actually pretty different."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Like they, they are on pretty orthogonal dimensions of what kind of things that they're building."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "They are using the same AI engine."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "So it's very possible that, you know, they're both going to be, um, sort of one day, um, kind of using a similar, almost like an internal internal combustion engine."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "It's a very bad metaphor, but similar internal combustion engine, and maybe one of them is building like a car."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "The other one is building a truck or something."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So ultimately the use case is very different."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "So you, like I said, are one of the founders of Optimus, right?"},

company."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Let's go from the very beginning."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "What does it take to start an autonomous vehicle company?"}, {"time": 1802, "text": "How do you go from idea to deploying vehicles like you are in a few, a bunch of places, including New York?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "I would say that I think that, you know, what happened to us is it was, was the following."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I think, um, we realized a lot of kind of talk in the autonomous vehicle industry back in like 2014, even when we wanted to kind of get started."}, {"time": 1822,

"text": "Um, you know, I was a part of, um, MIT's urban challenge entry."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Um, it kind of like, it has an interesting history."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So, um, I did in, in, in college and in high school, sort of a lot of mathematically oriented work."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "I mean, I kind of, you know, at some point, uh, it kind of hit me."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "I wanted to build something."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And so I came to MIT's mechanical engineering program and I now realize, I think my advisor hired me because I could do like really good math, but I told him that, no, no, no, I want to work on that urban challenge car."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "I want to build the autonomous car."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And I think that was, that was kind of like a process where we really learned, I mean, what the challenges are and what kind of limitations are we up against, you know, like having the limitations of computers or understanding human behavior, there's so many of these things."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And I think it just kind of didn't."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And so, so we said, Hey, you know, like, why don't we take a more like a market based approach?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So we focus on a certain kind of market and we build a system for that."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "What we're building is not so much of like an autonomous vehicle only, I would say."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "So we build full autonomy into the vehicles."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "But, you know, the way we kind of see it is that we think that the approach should actually involve humans operating them, not just, just not sitting in the vehicle."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And I think today, what we have is today, we have one person operate one vehicle, no matter what that vehicle, it could be a forklift, it could be a truck, it could be a car, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "And we want to go from that to 10 people operate 50 vehicles."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "If you're referring to a world of maybe perhaps teleoperation, so can you just say what it means for 10?"}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It might be confusing for people listening."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "What does it mean for 10 people to control 50 vehicles?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "That's a good point."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "So I think it's, I very deliberately didn't call it teleoperation because what people think then is that people think, away from the vehicle sits a person, sees like maybe puts on goggles or something, VR and drives the car."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "So that's not at all what we mean, but we mean the kind of intelligence whereby humans are in control, except in certain places, the vehicles can execute on their own."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And so imagine like, like a room where people can see what the other vehicles are doing and everything."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "And you know, there will be some people who are more like, more like air traffic controllers, call them like AV controllers."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "And so these AV controllers would actually see kind of like a whole map and they would understand where vehicles are really confident and where they kind of need a little bit more help."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And the help shouldn't be for safety."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Help should be for efficiency."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "Vehicles should be safe no matter what."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "If you had zero people, they could be very safe, but they'd be going five miles an hour."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "And so if you want them to go around 25 miles an hour, then you need people to come in and, and for example, you know, the vehicle come to an intersection and the vehicle can say, you know, I can wait."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "I can inch forward a little bit, show my intent, or I can turn left."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And right now it's clear I can turn, I know that, but before you give me the go, I won't."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And so that's one example."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "This doesn't mean necessarily we're doing that actually."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "I think, I think if you go down all the, all that much detail that every intersection you're kind of expecting a person to press a button, then I don't think you'll get the efficiency benefits you want."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "You need to be able to kind of go around and be able to do these things."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "But, but I think you need people to be able to set high level behavior to vehicles."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "That's the other thing with autonomous vehicles, you know, I think a lot of people kind of think about it as follows."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "I mean, this happens with technology a lot."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "You know, you think, all right, so I know about cars and I heard robots."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So I think how this is going to work out is that I'm going to buy a car, press a button and it's going to drive itself."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And when is that going to happen?"}, {"time": 2071, "text": "You know, and people kind of tend to think about it that way, but when you think about what really happens is that something comes in in a way that you didn't even expect."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "If asked, you might have said, I don't think I need that, or I don't think it should be that and so on."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And then, and then that, that becomes the next big thing, coding code."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And so I think that this kind of different ways of humans operating vehicles could be really powerful."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "I think that sooner than later, we might open our eyes up to a world in which you go around walk in a mall and there's a bunch of security robots that are exactly operated in this way."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "You go into a factory or a warehouse, there's a whole bunch of robots that are playing exactly in this way."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "You go to a, you go to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, you see a whole bunch of autonomous vehicles, Optimus Ride, and they're operated maybe in this way."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "But I think people kind of don't see that."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "I sincerely think that there's a possibility that we may almost see like a whole mushrooming of this technology in all kinds of places that we didn't expect before."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And that may be the real surprise."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And then one day when your car actually drives itself, it may not be all that much of a surprise at all because you see it all the time."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "You interact with them, you take the Optimus Ride, hopefully that's your choice."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And then you hear a bunch of things, you go around, you interact with them."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Like you have a little delivery vehicle that goes around the sidewalks and delivers you things and then you take it, it says thank you."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And then you get used to that and one day your car actually drives itself and the regulation goes by and you can hit the button of sleep and it wouldn't be a surprise at all."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "I think that may be the real reality."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So there's going to be a bunch of applications that pop up around autonomous vehicles, some of which, maybe many of which we don't expect at all."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So if we look at Optimus Ride, what do you think, you know, the viral application, the one that like really works for people in mobility, what do you think Optimus Ride will connect with in the near future first?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "I think that the first places that I like to target honestly is like these places where transportation is required within an environment, like people typically call it geofence."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "So you can imagine like roughly two mile by two mile could be bigger, could be smaller type of an environment."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And there's a lot of these kinds of environments that are typically transportation deprived."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "The Brooklyn Navy Yard that, you know, we're in today, we're in a few different places, but that was the one that was last publicized and that's a good example."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So there's not a lot of transportation there and you wouldn't expect like, I don't know, I think maybe operating an Uber there ends up being sort of a little too expensive or when you compare it with operating Uber elsewhere, elsewhere becomes the priority and these places become totally transportation deprived."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And then what happens is that, you know, people drive into these places and to go from point A to point B inside this place within that day, they use their cars."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "And so we end up building more parking for them to, for example, take their cars and go to the lunch place."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "And I think that one of the things that can be done is that, you know, you can put in efficient, safe, sustainable transportation systems into these types of places first."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And I think that, you know, you could deliver mobility in an affordable way, affordable, accessible, you know, sustainable way."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "But I think what also enables is that this kind of effort, money, area, land that we spend on parking, you could reclaim some of that."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And that is on the order of like, even for a small environment like two mile by two mile, it doesn't have to be smack in the middle of New York."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "I mean, anywhere else you're talking tens of millions of dollars."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "If you're smack in the middle of New York, you're looking at billions of dollars of savings just by doing that."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And that's the economic part of it."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "And there's a societal part, right?"}, {"time": 2311, "text": "I mean, just look around."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "I mean the places that we live are like built for cars."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "It didn't look like this just like a hundred years ago, like today, no one walks in the middle of the street."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "It's for cars."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "No one tells you that growing up, but you grow into that reality."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "And so sometimes they close the road."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "It happens here, you know, like the celebration, they close the road."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "Still people don't walk in the middle of the road, like just walk in the middle and people don't."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "But I think it has so much impact, the car in the space that we have."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And I think we talked about sustainability, livability."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "I mean, ultimately these kinds of places that parking spots at the very least could change into something more useful or maybe just like park areas, recreational."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "And so I think that's the first thing that we're targeting."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And I think that we're getting like a really good response, both from an economic societal point of view, especially places that are a little bit forward looking."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And like, for example, Brooklyn Navy Yard, they have tenants."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "There's distinct direct call like new lab."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "It's kind of like an innovation center."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "There's a bunch of startups there."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "And so, you know, you get those kinds of people and, you know, they're really interested in sort of making that environment more livable."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "And these kinds of solutions that Optimus Ride provides almost kind of comes in and becomes that."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And many of these places that are transportation deprived, you know, they have, they actually rent shuttles."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "And so, you know, you can ask anybody, the shuttle experience is like terrible."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "People hate shuttles."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Because, you know, like the driver is very expensive in a shuttle business."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "So what makes sense is to attach 20, 30 seats to a driver."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And a lot of people have this misconception."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "They think that shuttles should be big."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Sometimes we get that at Optimus Ride."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "We tell them, we're going to give you like four seaters, six seaters."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And we get asked like, how about like 20 seaters?"}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I'm like, you know, you don't need 20 seaters."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "You want to split up those seats so that they can travel faster and the transportation delays would go down."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "That's what you want."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "If you make it big, not only you will get delays in transportation, but you won't have an agile vehicle."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "It will take a long time to speed up, slow down and so on."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "You need to climb up to the thing."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So it's kind of like really hard to interact with."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And scheduling too, perhaps when you have more smaller vehicles, it becomes closer to Uber where you can actually get a personal, I mean, just the logistics of getting the vehicle to you becomes easier when you have a giant shuttle."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "There's fewer of them and it probably goes on a route, a specific route that is supposed to hit."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "And when you go on a specific route and all seats travel together versus, you know, you have a whole bunch of them."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "You can imagine the route you can still have, but you can imagine you split up the seats and instead of, you know, them traveling, like, I don't know, a mile apart, they could be like, you know, half a mile apart if you split them into two."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "That basically would mean that your delays, when you go out, you won't wait for them for a long time."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And that's one of the main reasons, or you don't have to climb up."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "The other thing is that I think if you split them up in a nice way, and if you can actually know where people are going to be somehow, you don't even need the app."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "A lot of people ask us the app, we say, why don't you just walk into the vehicle?"}, {"time": 2510, "text": "How about you just walk into the vehicle, it recognizes who you are and it gives you a bunch of options of places that you go and you just kind of go there."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "I mean, people kind of also internalize the apps."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "Everybody needs an app."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "It's like, you don't need an app."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "You just walk into the thing."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "But I think one of the things that, you know, we really try to do is to take that shuttle experience that no one likes and tilt it into something that everybody loves."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And so I think that's another important thing."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "I would like to say that carefully, just like teleoperation, like we don't do shuttles."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "You know, we're really kind of thinking of this as a system or a network that we're designing."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "But ultimately, we go to places that would normally rent a shuttle service that people wouldn't like as much and we want to tilt it into something that people love."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "So you've mentioned this earlier, but how many Optimus ride vehicles do you think would be needed for any person in Boston or New York, if they step outside, there will be, this is like a mathematical question, there'll be two Optimus ride vehicles within line of sight."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Is that the right number to, well, at least one."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "For example, that's the density."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So meaning that if you see one vehicle, you look around, you see another one too."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Imagine like, you know, Tesla would tell you they collect a lot of data."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Do you see that with Tesla?"}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Like you just walk around and you look around, you see Tesla?"}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Very specific areas of California, maybe."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "Like there's a couple of zip codes that, you know, but I think that's kind of important because you know, like maybe the couple of zip codes, the one thing that we kind of depend on and I'll get to your question in a second, but now like we're taking a lot of tensions today."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "And so I think that this is actually important."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "People call this data density or data velocity."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "So it's very good to collect data in a way that, you know, you see the same place so many times."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Like you can drive 10,000 miles around the country or you drive 10,000 miles in a confined environment."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "You'll see the same intersection hundreds of times."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And when it comes to predicting what people are going to do in that specific intersection, you become really good at it versus if you draw in like 10,000 miles around the country, you've seen that only once."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And so trying to predict what people do becomes hard."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And I think that, you know, you said what is needed, it's tens of thousands of vehicles."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "You know, you really need to be like a specific fractional vehicle."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Like for example, in good times in Singapore, you can go and you can just grab a cab and they are like, you know, 10%, 20% of traffic, those taxis."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Ultimately that's where you need to get to."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "So that, you know, you get to a certain place where you really, the benefits really kick off in like orders of magnitude type of a point."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "But once you get there, you actually get the benefits."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And you can certainly carry people."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "I think that's one of the things people really don't like to wait for themselves."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "But for example, they can wait a lot more for the goods if they order something."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "Like you're sitting at home and you want to wait half an hour."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "That sounds great."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "People will say it's great."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "You want to, you're going to take a cab, you're waiting half an hour."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Like that's crazy."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "You don't want to wait that much."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "But I think, you know, you can, I think really get to a point where the system at peak times really focuses on kind of transporting humans around."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And then it's really, it's a good fraction of the traffic to the point where, you know, you go, you look around and there's something there and you just kind of basically get in there and it's already waiting for you or something like that."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And then you take it."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "If you do it at that scale, like today, for instance, Uber, if you talk to a driver, right?"}, {"time": 2735, "text": "I mean, Uber takes a certain cut."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "It's a small cut."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Or drivers would argue that it's a large cut, but you know, it's when you look at the grand scheme of things, most of that money that you pay Uber kind of goes to the driver."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "And if you talk to the driver, the driver will claim that most of it is their time."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "You know, it's not spent on gas."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "They think it's not spent on the car per se as much."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "It's like their time."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And if you didn't have a person driving, or if you're in a scenario where, you know, like 0.1 person is driving the car, a fraction of a person is kind of operating the car because you know, you want to operate several."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "If you're in that situation, you realize that the internal combustion engine type of cars are very inefficient."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "You know, we build them to go on highways, they pass crash tests."},

{"time": 2795, "text": "But if you get through those inefficiencies and if you really build like urban cars and things like that, I think the economics really starts to check out."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Like to the point where, I mean, I don't know, you may be able to get into a car and it may be less than a dollar to go from A to B."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "As long as you don't change your destination, you just pay 99 cents and go there."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "If you share it, if you take another stop somewhere, it becomes a lot better."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "You know, these kinds of things, at least for models, at least for mathematics and theory, they start to really check out."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So I think it's really exciting what Optimus Ride is doing in terms of it feels the most reachable, like it'll actually be here and have an impact."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Yeah, that is the idea."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And if we contrast that, again, we'll go back to our old friends, Waymo and Tesla."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "So Waymo seems to have sort of technically similar approaches as Optimus Ride, but a different, they're not as interested as having impact today."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And then Tesla is like the complete opposite, which is, you know, the entirety of the world actually is going to be automated."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Highway driving, urban driving, every kind of driving, you know, you kind of creep up to it by incrementally improving the capabilities of the autopilot system."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "So when you contrast all of these, and on top of that, let me throw a question that nobody likes, but is a timeline."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "When do you think each of these approaches, loosely speaking, nobody can predict the future, will see mass deployment?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So Elon Musk predicts the craziest approach is, I've heard figures like at the end of this year, right?"},

guess."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "I mean, I don't know where Tesla can look at or Elon Musk can look at and say, hey, you know, it's the end of this year."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "I mean, I don't know what you can look at."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "You know, even the data that, I mean, if you look at the data, even kind of trying to extrapolate the end state without knowing what exactly is going to go, especially for like a machine learning approach."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "I mean, it's just kind of very hard to predict."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "But I do think the following does happen."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "I think a lot of people, you know, what they do is that there's something that I called a couple times time dilation in technology prediction happens."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Let me try to describe a little bit."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "There's a lot of things that are so far ahead, people think they're close."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "And there's a lot of things that are actually close."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "People think it's far ahead."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "People try to kind of look at a whole landscape of technology development,

"People take it, clamp it, and put it into the next three years."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And so then what happens is that there's some things that maybe can happen by the end of the year or next year and so on."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "And they push that into like few years ahead, because it's just hard to explain."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "And there are things that are like, we're looking at 20 years more, maybe, you know, hopefully in my lifetime type of things, because, you know, we don't know."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "I mean, we don't know how hard it is even."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Like that's a problem."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "We don't know like if some of these problems are actually AI complete, like, we have no idea what's going on."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And you know, we take all of that and then we clump it."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And then we say three years from now."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "And then some of us are more optimistic."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So they're shooting at the end of the year and some of us are more realistic."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "They say like five years, but you know, we all, I think it's just hard to know."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "And I think trying to predict like products ahead two, three years, it's hard to know in the following sense."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "You know, like we typically say, okay, this is a technology company, but sometimes, sometimes really you're trying to build something where the technology does, like there's a technology gap, you know, like, and Tesla had that with electric vehicles, you know, like when they first started, they would look at a chart much like a Moore's law type of chart."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "And they would just kind of extrapolate that out and they'd say, we want to be here."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "What's the technology to get that?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "It goes like this."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "We're just going to, you know, keep going with AI that goes into the cars."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "We don't even have that."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "Like we don't, we can't, I mean, what can you quantify, like what kind of chart are you looking at?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "But so, but so I think when there's that technology gap, it's just kind of really hard to predict."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So now I realize I talked like five minutes and avoid your question."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "I didn't tell you anything about that and it was very skillfully done."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "That was very well done."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And I don't think you, I think you've actually argued that it's not a use, even any answer you provide now is not that useful."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "It's going to be very hard."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "There's one thing that I really believe in and, um, and you know, this is not my idea and it's been, you know, discussed several times, but, but this, um, this, this kind of like something like a startup, um, or, or a kind of an innovative company, um, including definitely may one, may Waymo, Tesla, maybe even some of the other big companies that are kind of trying things."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "This kind of like iterated learning is very important."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "The fact that we're over there and we're trying things and so on, I think that's, um, that that's important."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "We try to understand."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And, and I think that, you know, the code in code Silicon Valley has done that with business models pretty well."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "And now I think we're trying to get to do it, but there's a literal technology gap."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "I mean, before, like, you know, you're trying to build, I'm not trying to, you know, I think these companies are building great technology to, for example, enable internet search to do it so quickly."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And that kind of didn't, didn't, wasn't there so much, but at least like it was a kind of a technology that you could predict to some degree and so on."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "And now we're just kind of trying to build, you know, things that it's kind of hard to quantify what kind of a metric are we looking at?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "So psychologically as a sort of a, as a leader of graduate students and at Optimus ride a bunch of brilliant engineers, just curiosity, psychologically, do you think it's good to think that, you know, whatever technology gap we're talking about can be closed by the end of the year or do you, you know, cause we don't know."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So the way, do you want to say that everything is going to improve exponentially to yourself and to others around you as a leader, or do you want to be more sort of maybe not cynical, but I don't want to use realistic cause it's hard to predict, but yeah, maybe more cynical, pessimistic about the ability to close that gap."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "I think that, you know, going back, I think that iterated learning is like key that, you know, you're out there, you're running experiments to learn."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And that doesn't mean sort of like, you know, like, like your Optimus ride, you're kind of doing something, but like in an environment, but like what Tesla is doing, I think is also kind of like this, this kind of notion."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "And, and, you know, people can go around and say like, you know, this year, next year, the other year and so on."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "But, but I think that the nice thing about it is that they're out there, they're pushing this technology in."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "I think what they should do more of, I think that kind of informed people about what kind of technology that they're providing, you know, the good and the bad."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "I think they're kind of go out there and they, they do great things."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "They do their own kind of experiment."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "I think we do our own and I think we're closing some similar technology gaps, but some also some are orthogonal as well."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "You know, I think like, like we talked about, you know, people being remote, like it's something or in the kind of environments that we're in or think about a Tesla car, maybe, maybe you can enable it one day."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "Like there's, you know, low traffic, like you're kind of the stop on go motion, you just hit the button and the, you can release, or maybe there's another lane that you can pass into, you go in that."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "I think they can enable these kinds of, I believe it."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And so I think that that part, that is really important and that is really key."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "And beyond that, I think, you know, when is it exactly going to happen and, and, and so on."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "I mean it's like I said, it's very hard to predict."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And I would, I would imagine that it would be good to do some sort of like a, like a one or two year plan when it's a little bit more predictable that, you know, the technology gaps you close and, and the, and the kind of sort of product that would ensue."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "So I know that from Optimus ride or, you know, other companies that I get involved in."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "I mean, at some point you find yourself in a situation where you're trying to build a product and, and people are investing in that, in that, you know, building effort and those investors that they do want to know as they compare the investments they want to make, they do want to know what happens in the next one or two years."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And I think that's good to communicate that."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "But I think beyond that, it becomes, it becomes a vision that we want to get to someday and saying five years, 10 years, I don't think it means anything."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But iterative learning is key to do and learn."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "I think that is key."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "You know, I got to sort of throw back right at you criticism in terms of, you know, like Tesla or somebody communicating, you know, how someone works and so on."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "I got a chance to visit Optimus ride and you guys are doing some awesome stuff and yet the internet doesn't know about it."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "So you should also communicate more showing off, you know, showing off some of the awesome stuff, the stuff that works and stuff that doesn't work."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "I mean, it's just the stuff I saw with the tracking of different objects and pedestrians."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "So I mean, incredible stuff going on there."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "Maybe it's just the nerd in me, but I think the world would love to see that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "That's, that's well taken."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Um, you know, I, I should say that it's not like, you know, we, we, we weren't able to, I think we made a decision at some point, um, that decision did involve me quite a bit on kind of, um, uh, sort of doing this in kind of coding code stealth mode for a bit."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Um, but I think that, you know, we'll, we'll open it up quite a lot more."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "And I think that we are also at Optimus ride kind of hitting, um, when you have new era, um, you know, we're, we're, we're big now, we're doing a lot of interesting things and I think, you know, some of the deployments that we've kind of announced were some of the first bits, bits of, um, information that we kind of put out into the world."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "We'll also put out our technology, a lot of the things that we've been developing is really amazing."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "And then, you know, we're, we're gonna, we're gonna start putting that out now."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "We're especially interested in sort of like, um, being able to work with the best people."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And I think, and I think it's, it's good to not just kind of show them when they come to our office for an interview, but just put it out there in terms of like, you know, get people excited about what we're doing."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "So on the autonomous vehicle space, let me ask one last question."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So Elon Musk famously said that lighter is a crutch."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "So I've talked to a bunch of people about it, got to ask you, you use that crutch quite a bit in the DARPA days."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "So, uh, uh, you know, and his, his idea in general, sort of, you know, more provocative and fun, I think than a technical discussion, but the idea is that camera based, primarily camera based systems is going to be what defines the future of autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "So what do you think of this idea?"}, {"time": 3556, "text": "Lighter is a crutch versus primarily, uh, camera based systems."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "First things first, I think, you know, I'm a big believer in just camera based autonomous vehicle systems."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "Um, I think that, you know, you can put in a lot of autonomy and, and you can do great things."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "And, and it's, it's, it's very possible that at the time scales, like I said, we can't predict 20 years from now, like you may be able to do, do things that we're doing today only with LIDAR and then you may be able to do them just with cameras."}, {"time": 3588, "text": "And I think that, um, you know, you, you can just, um, I, I, I think that I will put my name on it too."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "You know, there will be a time when you can only use cameras and you'll be fine."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "Um, at that time though, it's very possible that, you know, you find the LIDAR system as another robustifier or, or it's so affordable that it's stupid not to, you know, just kind of put it there."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And I think, um, and I think we may be looking at a future like that."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "You think we're over relying on LIDAR right now, because we understand the better it's more reliable in many ways in terms of, from a safety perspective."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "It's easier to build with."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "That's the other, that's the other thing."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "I think to be very frank with you, I mean, um, you know, we've seen a lot of sort of autonomous vehicles companies come and go and the approach has been, you know, you slap a LIDAR on a car and it's kind of easy to build with when you have a LIDAR, you know, you just kind of code it up and, and you hit the button and you do a demo."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So I think there's admittedly, there's a lot of people, they focus on the LIDAR cause it's easier to build with."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "That doesn't mean that, you know, without the camera, just cameras, you can, uh, you cannot do what they're doing, but it's just kind of a lot harder."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "And so you need to have certain kinds of expertise to exploit that."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "What we believe in and, you know, you may be seeing some of it is that, um, we believe in computer vision."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "We certainly work on computer vision and Optimus ride, uh, by a lot, like, um, and, and we've been doing that from day one."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "And we also believe in sensor fusion."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So, you know, we, we do, we have a relatively minimal use of LIDARs, but, but we do use them."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "And I think, you know, in the future, I really believe that the following sequence of events may happen."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "First things first, number one, there may be a future in which, you know, there's like cars with LIDARs and everything and the cameras, but you know, this in this 50 year ahead future, they can just drive with cameras as well."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "Especially in some isolated environments and cameras, they go and they do the thing in the same future."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "And if you don't put the LIDAR, it's a more expensive system because you have to put in a lot of compute."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "Like, this is another possibility."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "Um, I do think that a lot of the, um, sort of initial deployments of self driving vehicles, I think they will involve LIDARs and especially either low range or short, um, either short range or low resolution LIDARs are actually not that hard to build in solid state."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "Uh, they're still scanning, but like MEMS type of scanning LIDARs and things like that, they're like, they're actually not that hard."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "I think they will maybe kind of playing with the spectrum and the phase arrays that they're a little bit harder, but, but I think, um, like, you know, putting a MEMS mirror in there that kind of scans the environment, it's not hard."}, {"time":

DARPA challenge in the, through the desert that we're seeing now, now with drone racing."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "I mean, one interesting thing about it is that, you know, people, the drone racing exists as an eSport."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And so it's much like you're playing a game, but there's a real drone going in an environment."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "A human being is controlling it with goggles on."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So there's no, it is a robot, but there's no AI."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "There's no AI."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Human being is controlling it."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "And so that's already there."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "And, um, and I've been interested in this problem for quite a while, actually, um, from a roboticist point of view."},

the problem that I'm interested, I mean, you asked about Alpha Pilot and I'll, I'll get there in a second, but the problem that I'm interested in, I'd love to build autonomous vehicles like, like

this game and you know, you have to like react in milliseconds and there's really, you know, you see something with your eyes and then that information just flows through your brain, into your hands

lives are lost every day, just in the United States on traffic accidents."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "And many of them are like known cases, you know, like the, uh, you're coming through like, uh, like a ramp going into a highway, you hit somebody and you're off, or, you know, like you kind of get confused."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "You try to like swerve into the next lane, you go off the road and

real time you have to process it."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "And the current CPUs, however fast you clock it are typically not enough."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "You need to build those computers from the ground up so that they can ingest all that data that I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "Just on that point, just really quick is the currently what's the bottom, like you mentioned the delays in humans, is it the hardware?"}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So you work a lot with Nvidia hardware."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "Is it the hardware or is it the software?"}, {"time": 4072, "text": "In fact, they need to be co developed I think in the future."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "I mean, that's a little bit what Nvidia does sort of like they almost like build the hardware and then they build the neural networks and then they build the hardware back and the neural networks back and it goes back and forth, but it's that co design."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And I think that, you know, like we try to way back, we try to build a fast drone that could use a camera image to like track what's moving in order to find where it is in the world."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "This typical sort of, you know, visual inertial state estimation problems that we would solve."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And you know, we just kind of realized that we're at the limit sometimes of, you know, doing simple tasks."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "We're at the limit of the camera frame rate because you know, if you really want to track things, you want the camera image to be 90% kind of like, or some somewhat the same from one frame to the next."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And why are we at the limit of the camera frame rate?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "It's because camera captures data."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "It puts it into some serial connection."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "It could be USB or like there's something called camera serial interface that we use a lot."}, {"time": 4132,

another kind of universal limit that you can transfer the data."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So you have to be much more intelligent on how you capture those pixels."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "You can take compute and put it right next to the pixels."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "People are building those."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "How hard is it to do?"}, {"time": 4158, "text": "How hard is it to get past the bottleneck of the copper wire?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "Yeah, you need to, you need to do a lot of parallel processing, as you can imagine."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "The same thing happens in the GPUs, you know, like the data is transferred in parallel somehow."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "It gets into some parallel processing."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "I think that, you know, like now we're really kind of diverted off into so many different dimensions, but."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "So it's aggressive flight."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "How do we make drones see many more frames a second in order to enable aggressive flight?"}, {"time": 4186, "text": "That's a super interesting problem."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "That's an interesting problem."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So, but like, think about it."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "You have, you have CPUs."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "You clock them at, you know, several gigahertz."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "We don't clock them faster, largely because, you know, we run into some heating issues and things like that."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "But the whole thing is that three gigahertz clock light travels kind of like on the order of a few inches or an inch."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "That's the size of a chip."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "And so you pass a clock cycle and as the clock signal is going around in the chip, you pass another one."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And so trying to coordinate that, the design of the complexity of the chip becomes so hard."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "I mean, we have hit the fundamental limits of the universe in so many things that we're designing."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "I don't know if people realize that."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "Like, we can't make transistors smaller because like quantum effects, the electrons start to tunnel around."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "We can't clock it faster."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "One of the reasons why is because like information doesn't travel faster in the universe and we're limited by that."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Same thing with the laser scanner."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "But so then it becomes clear that, you know, the way you organize the chip into a CPU or even a GPU, you now need to look at how to redesign that."}, {"time": 4259, "text": "If you're going to stick with Silicon, you could go do other things too."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "I mean, there's that too, but you really almost need to take those transistors, put them in a different way so that the information travels on those transistors in a different way, in a much more way that is specific to the high speed cameras coming in."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "And so that's one of the things that we talk about quite a bit."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "So drone racing kind of really makes that embodies that and that's why it's exciting."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "It's exciting for people, you know, students like it."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "It embodies all those problems."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "But going back, we're building, quote, unquote, another engine."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "And that engine, I hope one day will be just like how impactful seat belts were in driving."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "Or it could enable, you know, next generation autonomous air taxis and things like that."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I mean, it sounds crazy, but one day we may need to perch land these things."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "If you really want to go from Boston to New York in more than a half hours, you may want to fix wing aircraft."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Most of these companies that are kind of doing quote unquote flying cars, they're focusing on that."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "But then how do you land it on top of a building?"}, {"time": 4326, "text": "You may need to pull off like kind of fast maneuvers for a robot, like perch land."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "It's going to go perch into a building."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "If you want to do that, like you need these kinds of systems."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "And so drone racing, you know, it's being able to go way faster than any human can comprehend."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "Take an aircraft, forget the quadcopter, you take your fixed wing, while you're at it, you might as well put some like rocket engines in the back and you just light it."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "You go through the gate and a human looks at it and just said, what just happened?"}, {"time": 4359, "text": "And they would say, it's impossible for me to do that."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And that's closing the same technology gap that would, you know, one day steer cars out of accidents."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "So that let me ask about the the the Alpha pilot challenge is a, I guess, a big prize potentially associated with it."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "But let me ask, reminiscent of the DARPA days, predictions, you think anybody will finish?"}, {"time": 4416, "text": "Well, not, not soon."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "I think that depends on how you set up the race course."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And so if the race course is a solo course, I think people will kind of do it."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "But can you set up some course, like literally some core, you get to design it is the algorithm developer, can you set up some course, so that you can be the best human?"}, {"time": 4438, "text": "When is that going to happen?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "Like that's not very easy, even just setting up some course, if you let the human that you're competing with set up the course, it becomes a lot easier, a lot harder."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So how many in the space of all possible courses are, would humans win and would machines win?"}, {"time": 4459, "text": "Let's get to that."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "I want to answer your other question, which is like, the DARPA challenge days, right?"}, {"time": 4464, "text": "What was really hard?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "I think, I think we understand, we understood what we wanted to build, but still building things, that experimentation, that iterated learning, that takes up a lot of time actually."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "And so in my group, for example, in order for us to be able to develop fast, we build like VR environments, we'll take an aircraft, we'll put it in a motion capture room, big, huge motion capture room, and we'll fly it in real time, we'll render other images and beam it back to the drone."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "That sounds kind of notionally simple, but it's actually hard because now you're trying to fit all that data through the air into the drone."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "And so you need to do a few crazy things to make that happen."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "But once you do that, then at least you can try things."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "If you crash into something, you didn't actually crash."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "So it's like the whole drone is in VR."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "We can do augmented reality and so on."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "And so I think at some point testing becomes very important."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "One of the nice things about Alpha Pilot is that they built the drone and they build a lot of drones and it's okay to crash."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "In fact, I think maybe the viewers may kind of like to see things that crash."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "That potentially could be the most exciting part."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "It could be the exciting part."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "And I think as an engineer, it's a very different situation to be in."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "Like in academia, a lot of my colleagues who are actually in this race and they're really great researchers, but I've seen them trying to do similar things whereby they built this one drone and somebody with like a face mask and a gloves are going right behind the drone."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "They're trying to hold it."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "If it falls down, imagine you don't have to do that."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "I think that's one of the nice things about Alpha Pilot Challenge where we have these drones and we're going to design the courses in a way that we'll keep pushing people up until the crashes start to happen."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "And we'll hopefully sort of, I don't think you want to tell people crashing is okay."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "Like we want to be careful here, but because we don't want people to crash a lot, but certainly we want them to push it so that everybody crashes once or twice and they're really pushing it to their limits."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "That's where iterated learning comes in, because every crash is a lesson."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "Is a lesson."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "So in terms of the space of possible courses, how do you think about it in the war of humans versus machines, where do machines win?"}, {"time": 4607, "text": "We look at that quite a bit."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "I mean, I think that you will see quickly that you can design a course and in certain courses like in the middle somewhere, if you kind of run through the course once, the machine gets beaten pretty much consistently by slightly."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "But if you go through the course like 10 times, humans get beaten very slightly, but consistently."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So humans at some point, you get confused, you get tired and things like that versus this machine is just executing the same line of code tirelessly, just going back to the beginning and doing the same thing exactly."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "I think that kind of thing happens and I realized sort of as humans, there's the classical things that everybody has realized."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "Like if you put in some sort of like strategic thinking, that's a little bit harder for machines that I think sort of comprehend."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "Machine is easy to do, so that's what they excel in."}]}, {"title": "Joe Rogan: Fear, Love, Chaos, and the Joe Rogan Experience |

think, oh my God, I suck."}, {"time": 908, "text": "I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing because I put in all that work."}, {"time": 911, "text": "And one of the reasons why I put in all that work is I don't like the end result most of the time."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So I need to work at it all the time."}, {"time": 919, "text": "And then there's physical struggle, which I think balances everything out."}, {"time": 923, "text": "Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery, where if you have extra charge, it's like it

like, cause he wants to meet, he wants to talk on this podcast, but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And I felt like this is a person, if I spend any time in

the hair stand on my neck, to be honest, because they are acting as if there is a derivation."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "They're acting as if, you know, you're supposed to think that this is a derivation and there's nothing even remotely resembling a derivate."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "They just pull the phi out of a hat completely."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Is one of the key criticisms

point."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "The, the core of it is that I think that the, you know, that they want to say that a system is more conscious the larger its value of phi."}, {"time": 1190, "text":

can apply to even computers."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I mean, I mean, the, the whole interest of the theory is the, you know, the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens, to

all."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Uh, but you know, to, to, to answer your question, I think the first thing we need to get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to

more?"}, {"time": 5036, "text": "I mean, just for starters, there is everything that we could do with a conventional computer with a polynomial amount of memory, okay, but possibly an exponential

can do with a randomized algorithm, right?"}, {"time": 5210, "text": "That can be done with a random algorithm, right?"}, {"time": 5215, "text": "That can sometimes, you know, has some probability of making a mistake."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "That's called BPP, bounded error probabilistic polynomial time."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "And then, of course, there's one that's very close to my own

understood about it?"}, {"time": 5240, "text": "Okay, so P is contained in BPP, which is contained in BQP, which is contained in P space, okay?"}, {"time": 5247, "text": "So anything you can, in fact, in something very similar to sharp P.

one."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Yeah, we did last time."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "But yeah, we did last time, okay?"}, {"time": 5289, "text": "But basically, you could always think of a quantum computation as like a branching tree of possibilities where each possible path that you could take through, you know, the space has a complex number attached to it called an amplitude, okay?"},

calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one, right?"}, {"time": 5320, "text": "And the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answer."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And then, you know, that's a complex number, so that, you know, how could that be a probability?"}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Then you take the squared absolute value of the result."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "That gives you a number between zero and one, okay?"}, {"time": 5344, "text": "So yeah, I just summarized quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds, okay?"}, {"time": 5350, "text": "But now, you know, what this already tells us is that anything I can do with a quantum computer, I could simulate with a classical computer if I only have exponentially more time, okay?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Because if I have exponential time, I could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of these amplitudes, right?"}, {"time": 5370, "text": "You know, that will be very inefficient, but it will work, right?"}, {"time": 5376, "text": "It's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem or, you know, they could never do anything that is literally uncomputable in Turing's sense, okay?"}, {"time": 5387, "text": "But now, as I said, there's even a stronger result which says that BQP is contained in PSPACE."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "The way that we prove that is that we say, if all I want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really, then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "All I need to do is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitudes that lead to that state."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum, but I can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the sum."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And hence the p, in the PSPACE?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Hence the PSPACE."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So what, out of that whole complexity zoo, and it could be BQP, what do you find is the most, the class that captured your heart the most, the most beautiful class that's just, yeah."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "I used, as my email address, bqpqpoly at

know, this is a class that I was involved in sort of defining, proving the first theorems about in 2003 or so."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "So it was kind of close to my heart."}, {"time": 5478, "text":

is, in however many thousands of generations that humans have been inhabiting this planet, there has never been a transmissible form of H5N1."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "And influenza has been around

that outcome."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "And if there was inevitability around that, it's not like there's just one set of genetic code that would get there."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "There's all kinds of different mutations that could conceivably result in that kind of an outcome, unbelievable diversity of mutations."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And so we're not actually creating something

bit further off, but it wouldn't cost tens of billions in research dollars, it would be a relatively modest and affordable budget in relation to the threat at home diagnostics that can really, really

to me as an outsider that there was a bizarre unwillingness on the part of the CDC and other institutions to admit to, to frame and to contextualize uncertainty."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "Maybe they

anything."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Don't wear them."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "When the real driver for that was we don't want these clowns going out and depleting Amazon of masks because they may

all, I believe that most people are good and want to do good and are just better at doing good and more inclined to do good on this world, and more than that, people who are malevolent are usually

knucklehead and they're really widespread, it becomes very, very hard to defend against all instances of usage."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "Now the good news, quote unquote, about mass shootings, if there is any, and there is some, is even the most brutal and carefully planning and well armed mass shooter can only take so many victims."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "And the same is true, there's been four instances that I'm aware of, of commercial pilots committing suicide by downing their planes and taking all their passengers with them."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "These weren't Boeing engineers,

to the scale of the storm."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "Of course, again, certain kinds of exponential threats require us to build up the defenses way earlier than we usually do, and that's I guess the question."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "But I ultimately am hopeful that the natural process of hitting the snooze button until the deadline is right in front of us will work out for quite a long time for us humans."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And I fully agree."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "That's why I'm fundamentally, I may not sound like it thus far, but I'm fundamentally very, very optimistic about our ability to short circuit this threat because there is, again, I'll stress the technological feasibility and the profound affordability of a relatively simple set of steps that we can take to preclude it, but we do have to take those steps."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "What I'm hoping to do and trying to do is inject a notion of what those steps are into the public conversation and do my small part to up the odds that that actually ends up happening."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "The danger with this one is it is exponential, and I think that our minds are fundamentally struggle to understand exponential math."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "It's just not something we're wired for."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "Our ancestors didn't confront exponential processes when they were growing up on the savanna, so it's not something that's intuitive to us and our intuitions are reliably defeated when exponential processes come along."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "So that's issue number one."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And issue number two with something like this is it kind of only takes one."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "That ball only has to go into the net once and we're doomed,

think of with the exception of nuclear war that has the one bad outcome and game over."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "And that means that we need to be unbelievably serious about these defenses and we need to do things that might on the surface seem like a tremendous overreaction so that we can be prepared to nip anything that comes along in the bud."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "I like you believe that's eminently doable."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "I like you believe that the good guys outnumber the bad guys in this particular one to a degree that probably has no precedent in history."},

was so angry about Napster and so forth that for essentially three and a half years, they folded their arms, stamped their feet, and boycotted the internet."}, {"time": 7549, "text": "So they

we, the music industry, insist that you steal it because we are not going to sell it to you."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "So what that did is it made an entire generation of people morally comfortable

even trickier tools and like tweakier tools like Kazaa and so forth came along, people just figured out how to do it."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "So by the time they finally, grudgingly, it took years,

that's morally okay and I know how to get it."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "And so streaming took many, many, many more years to take off and become the gargantuan thing the juggernaut is today than

from that?"}, {"time": 7641, "text": "Cause we're probably in the midst of living through a bunch of similar situations in different domains currently."}, {"time": 7647, "text": "We just don't know."}, {"time": 7648, "text": "There's a lot of things in this world that are really painful."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "Like, I mean, I don't know if you can draw perfect parallels, but fiat money

changing way too slowly."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "There's a lot of people making that argument where there should be a complete like Coinbase and all this stuff switched to that."}, {"time": 7672,

the institutional mechanisms to do the pivot."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "Is that just the way of companies?"}, {"time": 7703, "text": "Well, I think what happens, I'll use the case of the music industry."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "There was an economic model that had put food on the table and paid for marble lobbies and seven and even eight figure executive salaries for many, many decades, which was the physical collection of music."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "And then you start talking about something like unlimited streaming and it seems so ephemeral and like such a long shot that people start worrying about cannibalizing their own business and they lose sight of the fact that something illicit is cannibalizing their business at an extraordinarily fast rate."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "And so if they don't do it themselves, they're doomed."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "I mean, we used to put slides in front of these folks, this is really funny, where we said, okay, let's assume Rhapsody, we want it to be 9.99 a month and we want it to be 12 months, so it's $120 a year from the budget of a music lover."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And then we were also able to get reasonably accurate statistics that showed how many CDs per year the average person who bothered to collect music, which was not all people, actually bought."}, {"time": 7764, "text": "And it was overwhelmingly clear that the average CD buyer spends a hell of a lot less than $120 a year on music."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "This is a revenue expansion, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "But all they could think of, and I'm not saying this in a pejorative or patronizing way, I don't blame them, they've grown up in this environment for decades, all they could think of was the incredible margins that they had on a CD."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "And they would say, well, if this CD, by the mechanism that you guys are proposing, the CD that I'm selling for $17.99, somebody would need to stream those songs."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "We were talking about a penny of playback then, it's less than that now that the record labels get paid."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "But would have to stream songs from that 1,799 times, it's never gonna happen."}, {"time": 7810, "text": "So they were just sort of stuck in the model of this, but it's like, no, dude, but they're gonna spend money on all this other stuff."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "So I think people get very hung up on that."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "I mean, another example is really the taxi industry was not monolithic, like the music labels."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "There was a whole bunch of fleets and a whole bunch of cities, very, very fragmented, it's an imperfect analogy."}, {"time": 7827, "text":

that with the branding of yellow taxis, universally known and kind of loved by Americans and expanded their fleet in a necessary manner, I don't think Uber or Lyft ever would have gotten a foothold."}, {"time": 7861, "text": "But the problem there was that real economics in the taxi industry wasn't with fares, it was with the scarcity of medallions."}, {"time": 7870, "text": "And so the taxi fleets, in many cases, owned gazillions of medallions whose value came from their very scarcity."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "So they simply couldn't pivot to that."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "So I

you look at young founders, they're generally coming out of very nascent emerging fields of technology where simply being present and accounted for and engaged in the community for a period of even

founder before I get to the rest of the team and that'll be mercifully brief is the founder has to be obviously a really great hirer but just important a very good firer."}, {"time": 8132, "text":

get a good intuition of what's possible, but the very first hire, I mean, a great way to solve that is to have a technical co founder and dual founder companies have become extremely common for that

ideas, like first principles thinking, asking big difficult questions of like future trajectories or having a big vision and big picture dreams."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "You can almost be a dreamer, it feels like, when you're like not the founder, but in the space of sort of leadership."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "But when it gets to the ground floor, there has to be execution, there has to be hitting deadlines."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And sometimes those are attention."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "There's something about dreams that are attention with the pragmatic nature of execution."},

8735, "text": "You might remember the NPR show Car Talk, I couldn't care less about auto mechanics myself."}, {"time": 8743, "text": "But I love that show because the banter between those two guys was just beyond, it was without any parallel, right?"}, {"time": 8750, "text": "And some kind of edgy podcasts like Red Scare is just really entertaining to me because the banter between the women on that show is just so good, and All In and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 8759, "text": "So I think it's a combination of sort of the arc and the chemistry."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "And I think because the arc can be so important, that's why very, very highly produced podcasts like This American Life, obviously a radio show, but I think of a podcast because that's how I always consume it, or Criminal, or a lot of what Wondery does and so forth."}, {"time": 8781, "text": "That is real documentary making, and that requires a big team and a big budget relative to the kinds of things you and

chemistry."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "Yeah, and I've actually personally have lost, I used to love This American Life, and for some reason because it lacks the possibility of magic, it's engineered magic."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "I've fallen off of it myself as well."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "I mean, when I fell madly in love with it during the aughts, it was the only thing going."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "They were really smart to adopt podcasting as a distribution mechanism early."}, {"time": 8824, "text": "But yeah, I think that maybe there's a little bit less magic there now because I think they have agendas other than necessarily just delighting their listeners with quirky stories, which I think is what it was all about back in the day and some other things."}, {"time": 8837, "text": "Is there like a memorable conversation that you've had on the podcast, whether it was because it was wild and fun or one that was exceptionally challenging, maybe challenging to prepare for, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 8851, "text": "Is there something that stands out in your mind that you can draw an insight from?"}, {"time": 8855, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this no way diminishes the episodes that will not be the answer to these two questions, but an example of something that was really, really challenging to prepare for was George Church."}, {"time": 8868, "text": "So as I'm sure you know and as I'm sure many of your listeners know, he is one of the absolute leading lights in the field of synthetic biology."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "He's also unbelievably prolific."}, {"time": 8877, "text": "His lab is large and has all kinds of efforts have spun out of that."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "And what I wanted to make my George Church episode about was, first of all, grounding people into what is this thing called Symbio."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "And that required me to learn a hell of a lot more about Symbio than I knew going into it."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "So there was just this very broad, I mean, I knew much more than the average person going into that episode, but there was this incredible breadth of grounding that I needed to get myself in the domain."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "And then George does so many interesting things, there's so many interesting things emitting from his lab that, you know, and he and I had a really good dialogue, he was a great guide going into it."}, {"time": 8921, "text": "Minnowing it down to the three to four that I really wanted us to focus on to create a sense of wonder and magic in the listener of what could be possible from this very broad spectrum domain, that was a doozy of a challenge."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "That was a tough, tough, tough one to prepare for."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Now, in terms of something that was just wild and fun, unexpected, I mean, by the time we sat down to interview, I knew where we were going to go."}, {"time": 8947, "text": "But just in terms of the idea space, Don Hoffman, yeah, so Don Hoffman is, again, some listeners probably know because he's, I think I was the first podcaster to interview him."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "I'm sure some of your listeners are familiar with him, but he has this unbelievably contrarian take on the nature of reality, but it is contrarian in a way that all the ideas are highly internally consistent and snap together in a way that's just delightful."}, {"time": 8978, "text": "And it seems as radically violating of our intuitions and as radically violating of the probable nature of reality as anything that one can encounter."}, {"time": 8989, "text": "But an analogy that he uses, which is very powerful, which is what intuition could possibly be more powerful than the notion that there is a single unitary direction called down."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "When we're on this big flat thing for which there is a thing called down."}, {"time": 9005, "text": "And we all know, I mean, that's the most intuitive thing that one could probably think of."}, {"time": 9010, "text": "And we all know that that ain't true."}, {"time": 9012, "text": "So my conversation with Don Hoffman was just wild and full of plot twists and interesting stuff."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "And the interesting thing about the wildness of his ideas, it's to me at least as a listener, coupled with, he's a good listener and he empathizes with the people who challenge his ideas."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "Like what's a better way to phrase that?"}, {"time": 9039, "text": "He is a welcoming of challenge in a way that creates a really fun conversation."}, {"time": 9044, "text": "Oh, totally."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "He loves a parry or a jab, whatever the word is at his argument."}, {"time": 9052, "text": "He honors it."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "He's a very, very gentle and noncombatative soul, but then he is very good and takes great evident joy in responding to that in a way that expands your understanding of his thinking."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Let me as a small tangent of tying up together our previous conversation about listening.com and streaming and Spotify and the world of podcasting."}, {"time": 9080, "text": "So we've been talking about this magical medium of podcasting."}, {"time": 9085, "text": "I have a lot of friends at Spotify in the high positions of Spotify as well."}, {"time": 9092,

foot in both worlds, have a foot in both worlds, do you worry as well about the future of podcasting?"}, {"time": 9117, "text": "I think walled gardens are really toxic to the medium that they start balkanizing."}, {"time": 9125, "text": "So to take an example, I'll take two examples."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "When you start walling things off, A, you undermine the joy of friction free discovery, which is an incredibly valuable thing to deliver to your customer, both from a business standpoint and simply from a humanistic standpoint of do you want to bring delight to people?"},

like experience is what we have now in video."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "Like wow, is that show on Hulu, is it on Netflix, is it on something like IFC channel, is it on Discovery Plus, is it here, is it there?"}, {"time": 9203, "text": "And the more frustration and toe stubbing that people encounter when they are seeking something and they're already paying a very respectable amount of money per month to have access to content and they can't find it, the more that happens, the more people are going to be driven to piracy solutions like to hell with it."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "Never know

smother this friction free or eradicate this friction free discovery unless you want to sign up for lots of different services."}, {"time": 9261, "text": "And also dims the voice of somebody who might be able to have a far, far, far bigger impact by reaching far more neurons with their ideas."}, {"time": 9272, "text": "I'm going to use an example from I guess it was probably the 90s or maybe it was the aughts of Howard Stern, who had the biggest megaphone or maybe the second biggest after Oprah megaphone in popular culture."}, {"time": 9286, "text": "And because he was syndicated on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of radio stations at a time when terrestrial broadcast was the main thing people listened to in their car, no more obviously."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "But when he decided to go over to satellite radio, I can't remember if it was XM or Sirius, maybe they'd already merged at that point."}, {"time": 9301, "text": "But when he did that, he made, you know, totally his right to do it, a financial calculation that they were offering him a nine figure sum to do that."}, {"time": 9311, "text": "But his audience, because not a lot of people were subscribing to satellite radio at that point, his audience probably collapsed by, I wouldn't be surprised if it was as much as 95%."}, {"time": 9320, "text": "And so the influence that he had on the culture and his ability to sort of shape conversation and so forth just got muted."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "Yeah, and also there's a certain sense, especially in modern times, where the walled gardens naturally lead to, I don't know if there's a term for it, but people who are not creatives starting to have power over the creatives."}, {"time": 9352, "text": "And even if they don't stifle it, if they're providing, you know, incentives within the platform to shape, shift, or, you know, even completely mutate or distort the show, I mean, imagine somebody has got, you know, a reasonably interesting idea for a podcast and they get signed up with, let's say Spotify, and Spotify is going to give them financing to get the thing spun up."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "And Spotify is going to give them a certain amount of really, you know, powerful placement, you know, within the visual field of listeners."}, {"time": 9387, "text": "But Spotify has conditions for that."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "They say, look, you

in."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language."},

the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English, they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "And then you can start to ask about what those differences are."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And I think

to do a diff where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying and use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "I heard the individual translators in interviews and in blog posts and articles

be good."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I was happy about that, but he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And so in the end, he thinks that

nice like dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life, and that is the source of aliveness."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today, I ask that question

saying, this is the most important question of suicide."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "I think there is something to it, if you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "That's a deep question."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks

because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance that they do."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "So yeah, I think I'm not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the questions at the core of existentialism."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an action."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because, you know, imagine you're in like a

up, well you're pretty well formed by that."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "That seems a fact."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "It's a fact about Sartre too though, it was harder for him to notice it because he

about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "It's making these moves that are just outlandish and there's a kind of brilliance to them that we

roughly."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "But in something like music or art of a nonfinite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way, that doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "So now we could ask the system, why did you do it?"}, {"time": 9648, "text": "We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?"}, {"time": 9652, "text": "And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of

262, "text": "So I would like to see them go once more because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron, because if Tyron can turn up the pace and Jake can't handle it, then I think it's an eight, one or nine, two, right?"}, {"time": 272, "text": "If it goes the exact same way and maybe Tyron was a close split decision, I'm saying, oh, it's probably gonna be close every single time."}, {"time": 278, "text": "We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing."}, {"time": 281, "text": "So it's like, I feel like out of one match, it's not totally indicative of what the future is gonna look like."}, {"time": 287, "text": "I feel like Tyron would get a knockout and then you would still be in the same place, like not knowing what to predict."}, {"time": 296, "text": "Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul, looking back, you had a little bit of time now."}, {"time": 303, "text": "How would you analyze that fight?"}, {"time": 306, "text": "Well, I mean, the fight specifically, I got cracked with an overhand right, so I mean, it kind of sucks."}, {"time": 312, "text": "I would say, and this is where everyone's like, I really don't care and everyone's like, why would you do that?"}, {"time": 320, "text": "It turns your reputation."}, {"time": 321, "text": "It's like, well, I wanted to do it."}, {"time": 323, "text": "I had an enjoyable time training and in the buildup."}, {"time": 326, "text": "Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to get the win, but even despite the fact that I know what's gonna happen, if someone asked me to do it again, I probably would have done it again."}, {"time": 336, "text": "And so the way I was thinking about when I was deciding whether to do it or not, because I got the offer, it's like, okay, is this money, it can change my life."}, {"time": 345, "text": "Yeah, it could, right?"}, {"time": 346, "text": "It's not gonna double my net worth, but it's gonna add significantly and make my life easier."}, {"time": 350, "text": "Number two is like, when I was in high school, we used to do boxing matches for free, just because we thought it was fun."}, {"time": 355, "text": "When we didn't have something going on Friday night, me and my buddies would get together and we had some boxing goes on, basically, and we'd punch each other in the head."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable, and now they're gonna pay me a whole bunch of money, yeah, sure, I'll do it."}, {"time": 367, "text": "Would you, do you think if you got the rematch, if you did the rematch, would you, what are the odds you win?"}, {"time": 373, "text": "Okay, let's see."}, {"time": 374, "text": "I'm probably not very good."}, {"time": 375, "text": "I think he's pretty good, actually, and I'm not very good."}, {"time": 377, "text": "Now it's probably at a low point for me, because, so when I started training for that, I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been."}, {"time": 384, "text": "I came off my hip surgery."}, {"time": 385, "text": "I literally, when I said, yes, I'll do it, I had literally started working out the week before for the first time in my, since the surgery, because I wasn't able to do anything."}, {"time": 397, "text": "So could I perform better?"}, {"time": 399, "text": "Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron, like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?"}, {"time": 404, "text": "Probably not, but I don't think I can beat Tyron."}, {"time": 408, "text": "In boxing."}, {"time": 409, "text": "In boxing, correct, in boxing, yeah."}, {"time": 410, "text": "So my chances of beating him, you know, and watching that card, it's like, damn, like, it'd kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks, who I know can beat, that's what would be fun, you know?"}, {"time": 420, "text": "Because like, the training, the preparation was fun, but then obviously, I got my butt kicked, that sucked."}, {"time": 427, "text": "You know, can I swear on this podcast?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "Oh, I was gonna drop an F bomb, I wasn't quite sure, sorry."}, {"time": 431, "text": "I think that sucked, is a swear."}, {"time": 434, "text": "You could drop all of the F bombs you want."}, {"time": 436, "text": "So, preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared for that fight, or the Jordan Burrows exhibition?"}, {"time": 447, "text": "I mean, like, how did you approach it mentally, you know?"}, {"time": 451, "text": "Well, the Burrows thing, I obviously, it's okay."}, {"time": 453, "text": "So when I retired the first time in 2017, Burrows was the only current, like, we'll say really elite level wrestler that I'd never trained with."}, {"time": 462, "text": "I was really good friends with in Nebraska, head of the coaching team, still am."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And I said, hey, I just want, I'm gonna pay my own way."}, {"time": 467, "text": "I want to come down and train with Jordan, because I want to see what it feels like."}, {"time": 470, "text": "You know, I want to get in there and mix it up."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake."}, {"time": 474, "text": "I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love."}, {"time": 477, "text": "And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018, and I spent four days training with Jordan."}, {"time": 482, "text": "It was a really good time."}, {"time": 483, "text": "It gave me some great insight into how he thinks, and you know, what a great champion he is."}, {"time": 489, "text": "What was it like training with him?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "Like what, can you give some insights?"}, {"time": 493, "text": "Like what the, like how hard is the live training?"}, {"time": 498, "text": "Is it more drilling?"}, {"time": 499, "text": "Is it technical?"}, {"time": 500, "text": "Like how does, his, it seems like his style is very different than yours."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So how does that match up in the room in terms of like what you learn from each other, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 510, "text": "We only went full live for one, I think it was like 12 or 15 minutes ago where it was just go, wrestle."}, {"time": 515, "text": "We did a bunch of simulated live, but obviously he had, so I was a senior in college and he was a freshman in Nebraska."}, {"time": 523, "text": "And so we, our teams had dueled each other."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time, but he had followed my career."}, {"time": 530, "text": "And so when I went in there, it was like, hey, I know you're really good at this position."}, {"time": 534, "text": "What about this position?"}, {"time": 536, "text": "How exactly does it work?"}, {"time": 537, "text": "And then let's wrestle there, you know?"}, {"time": 540, "text": "And then, hey, what about this position?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "And so we would spend 30 to 40 minutes talking about that position."}, {"time": 547, "text": "On the ground or?"}, {"time": 548, "text": "It was like, one was a chest wrap, one was a headlock, one was, I don't remember, it's called the, we call it the lightning dump, but it's a."}, {"time": 555, "text": "The lightning dump?"}, {"time": 556, "text": "Yeah, my buddy's name was Lightning Luke Smith in high school and he was the first person I saw do it."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So usually when I see someone do something, then I name that move after them."}, {"time": 567, "text": "Great name."}, {"time": 568, "text": "It's a good name."}, {"time": 569, "text": "Yeah, but so what I said with that is like, he was still trying to be the best in the world."}, {"time": 573, "text": "I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burrows because I enjoy wrestling."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Is like someone who at that point, when he has five world titles at that, four or five at that point, a lot."}, {"time": 584, "text": "And so he said, my high school kids is like, hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world, who's bringing someone in and saying, well, how do I do this?"}, {"time": 593, "text": "And so the level of inquisitiveness he has is really impressive."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did because he's figuring out all these little situations."}, {"time": 604, "text": "And that's honestly one of the biggest things I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail to do as they get older."}, {"time": 609, "text": "Even when they get to early college age, they say, this is my style."}, {"time": 612, "text": "This is what I do."}, {"time": 614, "text": "I'm gonna lift and work out hard and I'm not gonna add anything to my game."}, {"time": 619, "text": "Whereas you've seen many progressions in Jordan Burrows game."}, {"time": 622, "text": "He just made his 10th world team."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And if you have a really keen eye, you've been able to watch him change."}, {"time": 630, "text": "I've been watching him since 2007."}, {"time": 632, "text": "He's changed so much."}, {"time": 634, "text": "And obviously still maintained a world class level almost the entire time."}, {"time": 638, "text": "When you say change, like what changed?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "Because he's got that double leg."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Yeah, but there's no double leg anymore."}, {"time": 645, "text": "He like his double leg for the first time against Alex Deering, he hadn't hit it in years."}, {"time": 648, "text": "Yeah, so that's like when people think about Jordan Burrows, they think about the double leg because in his early years, fire, he had a great double leg, right?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "And even so in those years, I would say the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg wasn't his level of explosiveness, it was his level of persistence."}, {"time": 665, "text": "He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles and on the screen, all of a sudden he's on you."}, {"time": 673, "text": "And he was just super persistent with it."}, {"time": 675, "text": "And I think that was probably the key."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And then you saw, when he came out to the won the first world championship in 2011, it was kind of that type of mentality."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And then shortly after then, obviously everyone was starting to lower their stance getting lower and he developed a really good like Mantis go behind series where he would go one way the other way."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Then he started developing really good like low single ankle pick type thing, you know?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "And then his hand fighting got really tremendous, like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And now I just commented at the 21 trials, like a few of the defensive sequences he got into, it was like, holy shit, like just not from an athletic standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the things he were doing was just tremendous."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So I've seen him as someone like who's continued to reinvent themselves over the course of the last 10, 12 years."}, {"time": 720, "text": "Especially as a junior and senior in college, you're exceptionally dominant."}, {"time": 726, "text": "If you were to face him at the peak, both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling, could you beat him?"}, {"time": 733, "text": "And if you can beat him, well, of course you can beat him."}, {"time": 738, "text": "How do you solve the Jordan Boroughs problem?"}, {"time": 740, "text": "Well, so from a folk style wrestling standpoint, Folk style, yes."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Folk style."}, {"time": 744, "text": "So, you know, he had some competitive matches his junior and senior year."}, {"time": 748, "text": "He had a two, one win over, or maybe it's three, two over Michael Chandler, who was my teammate who's fighting in the UFC now."}, {"time": 753, "text": "He had a two and win over Tyler Caldwell."}, {"time": 756, "text": "So I think you can glean some insight into that."}, {"time": 759, "text": "You know, he got ridden, he got so mad about this up on a podcast."}, {"time": 762, "text": "So during Corona, we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And we were doing like the last 10 years best 165s."}, {"time": 769, "text": "And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute."}, {"time": 772, "text": "He got so mad he wanted to come on the podcast the next day."}, {"time": 774, "text": "So hopefully he doesn't listen to this and be like, fuck you, man, you know?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "But, you know."}, {"time": 779, "text": "This is during Corona."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Corona, last year."}, {"time": 781, "text": "He got mad."}, {"time": 782, "text": "We were talking about, we were."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Before the trials."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Yeah, correct, yeah."}, {"time": 785, "text": "So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus and that was his junior year, not his senior year."}, {"time": 791, "text": "Sure, right?"}, {"time": 791, "text": "But it's close."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So I think there's some things there."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I think the interesting thing would be if I would have stuck around, right?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "So I chose to go into mixed martial arts after 2008, I would have been 74 and he would have been 74."}, {"time": 803, "text": "So we would have had to wrestle."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle is a lot more difficult to solve than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And I think, I don't think he would, I think he would acknowledge that he's much better at freestyle than he was at folk style."}, {"time": 817, "text": "You know, although he was very good, he's better."}, {"time": 819, "text": "This is like raw speed explosiveness."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Present a problem to you."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really excel on the mat in kind of either style."}, {"time": 829, "text": "In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions, but in folk style, like his whole, like in his entire college career, I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing, you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position."}, {"time": 843, "text": "He was good enough on most people to get off bottom without it being an issue, but it wasn't like, oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have to be careful, there's a lot of things here."}, {"time": 851, "text": "You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there."}, {"time": 853, "text": "Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't wanna say never, but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare, very, very rare, and he does have like lace transitions, so he gets a lot of points there."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So, and obviously freestyle is, it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Where we're only doing takedowns, so yeah."}, {"time": 872, "text": "Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials, to Kyle Dake?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "Oh, Kyle's so, so, he's so good, right?"}, {"time": 881, "text": "I mean, I think, I think his performance at the Olympics was, his loss then was shocking to, I mean, we understand it happened to Kyle Dake, you know?"}, {"time": 890, "text": "He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever, and obviously he was on the losing side for a while, and now he's on the winning side."}, {"time": 898, "text": "But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip, and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like it's not a coin flip."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake isn't gonna win that match significantly more times than he isn't, is what it feels like."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Yeah, I forgot which trials it was."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?"}, {"time": 919, "text": "Like he, he, you saw inklings of like, oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw, but then he lost one of the matches decisively, and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms, so actually in 16, at the trials we had, so Jake Herbert was number one seed, he was a former, as Guy Russell, I was a former world silver medalist."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet, who is now a world champion, Olympic champion."}, {"time": 954, "text": "You had Kyle Dake in the bracket, who was a two time world champion now, and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket, who had not made any teams yet, but is now, what, a four time world medalist, two time world champion."}, {"time": 964, "text": "So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that, won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal."}, {"time": 970, "text": "So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16, and Kyle's contention the whole time, and they argued about this, so I actually did a little bit of backstabbing."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Well, it's not backstabbing."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And both of them, or just one of them?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "I didn't tell any of them."}, {"time": 984, "text": "Okay, so Jordan got mad."}, {"time": 986, "text": "We talked about this fake match during Corona, right?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "We had to make up something to talk about."}, {"time": 991, "text": "There's obviously no matches."}, {"time": 992, "text": "So we talked about this fake match, and."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "Listen, here's what I said."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Kyle Dake's a four time NCAA champion."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "I said, Kyle Dake wins two, one on a minute and six ride time, which I mean, we're talking as close as it gets, as close as it gets for Kyle Dake, who's a four time NCAA champion."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "I'm sorry, we're talking."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Over Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "In a Folkestown match."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The hypothetical."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "Back in college or now?"}, {"time": 1019, "text": "Completely hypothetical."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Now or in college?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So completely hypothetical."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me for picking Kyle Dake."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "He wants to come on the next day and argue his point."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So I said, F that, that's dumb."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Oh, we had to pick a winner."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "We had to do something hypothetical."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So then I called Kyle Dake, and I said, Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case in the morning."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "If he's gonna do that, why don't you come in and argue your case?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So they both show up, and they went at it."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "But one of the contentions Kyle had for years, and there's still this rule, if you win a world level medal, the following year, you sit out until the very end of the American trials."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "And they do a best two or three."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan, he had to come through a tournament on Saturday."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Okay, probably three matches."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan in the best two out of three, right?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage because I have to compete on Saturday and then competing on, which it's a fair argument."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "But I also see USA Wrestling's point."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "It's like, if someone wins a world medal, we are gonna reward them because we want that person on the team again."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "It's crazy though that Kyle Dake had to wrestle, because he's not wrestling bums in that division."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Not bums, yeah."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And yeah, I don't know."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "I don't know how wrestlers do it."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Because you have to go to war like three matches and then face Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Yeah, especially a few of those years with Dakehead, the name Andrew Howe."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But it was a really competitive matches."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "David Taylor had really competitive matches with him."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Deeringer."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "So he had some really competitive matches before he ever got to Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So I never answered your initial question was, how did I feel?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "So the Jordan Burrows match, I was not in wrestling shape at all, meaning wrestling's heavily dependent, especially in neutral positions, heavily dependent on timing and other things."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "I was wrestling very, very minimally because I started fighting again."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So like my athletic shape was great, but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So I think they were actually trying to do Burrows, Dake at the Beat the Streets."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "In New York?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "In New York City."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "They usually raise like a million dollars."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "They started all these programs in New York City to get, which I really wonder what they're doing with the money now because they probably can't have the kids wrestling because New York's crazy."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "I think New York figures out a way what to do with the money."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Hence Michael Malice complaining that they're corrupt and all that."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization who then starts the clubs in New York."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "So I don't know what to do with the money."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Anyway, so I was called like, I don't know, two weeks before the event and said, hey, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "It fell out."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Would you wrestle him?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I said, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "And it's like, well, they said, I trained with them for four days the year before."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "It wasn't going to go so well for me, but it's like, okay, you're missing a main event."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life, I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I can help you guys raise a bunch of money for Beat the Streets."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "My goal is I think I thought I could get one take down or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "I didn't get there."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "He went kind of hard."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "He went hard?"}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Yeah, that asshole didn't give me a point."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Yeah, that."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I said, this is bullshit, Jordan."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "You're fucking going too hard right now."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "I'm not a wrestler."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I'm not a wrestler anymore."},

very good in the beginning."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I think that's where it all starts from."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13."}, {"time": 1471,

actually have, I have written this book on sports psych, but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Cause I've had this philosophy for years that there has to be this balance between two things, right?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "So on the one hand, in this category, on the one hand you have hating to lose."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "But on this other hand, you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Cause if you don't have that, you're never gonna reach your full potential either."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "And so you have to balance these two balls at the same time, right?"}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And so like for me, I always, and this is maybe cause I wasn't good, but I was always like, let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Let me go find, I would like literally, like seventh, eighth grade when I was starting to get better, it was like, and there's no internet."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Well, there's no one was using the internet."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "It was like a wrestling magazine."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And like, hey dad, there's a tournament here."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I think that, are the kids gonna be there?"}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?"}, {"time": 1537, "text": "You would wrestle like in competition against them."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "In competition."}, {"time": 1541,

trying to wrestle the best guys."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "Maybe I win, maybe I lose."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "There's no, when you do a competition, there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "You're just doing competition, right?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So like eighth grade year, I won way way, I probably lost a handful of times in the state of Wisconsin."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "It was probably really, really minimal the amount of times I lost, you know?"}, {"time": 1573, "text": "But it was just about getting the challenge."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And it's like, some kids, and not kids in my club, because I'll push them very hard on this, are scared of challenging themselves."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "They like being the big fish in the small pond."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "They're not willing to go say, I want to go get that guy, and I want to get that guy, and I want to get that guy."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me is like, I always just loved to challenge."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?"}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And I understood from a young age, because it wasn't a good, losing is a part of it."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "You're not always going to win."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And that was kind of it."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "It's like, hey, sometimes, you know, and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way, but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And like, that's pretty rare."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "I didn't plan for that to happen."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "That was just what happened, you know?"}, {"time": 1615, "text": "Okay, but you also didn't lose like the second part of your college career."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I don't like losing, I still don't like it."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But you seem to, okay, but you don't, you don't seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off a little bit."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "Okay, so like with, specifically with these two instances that you bring up."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "All right, let's."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "Let's go, let's go deep, let's go deep."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "So the Masvidal one, it feels different, because I had."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Let's, for people who don't know."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Masvidal loss was your first loss."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "First loss."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "In MMA."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "I mean, it was a dramatic loss."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Very dramatic."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially one of the greats of all time coming into this fight."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And so, this pressure, all of that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "I didn't feel the pressure."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "So the Masvidal fight is, he got one fucking move on me."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "It's not like he beat me."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And if we do that again, I think I win."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "At that point in my life, for sure, I think I win way, way, way more times than I lose."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "He knew that too."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "That's why he didn't want to sound the bout agreement."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad, because I had to continue to taunt him in order to get him to sign, right?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So that one hurt because, as people don't know, my MMA career, I'll just go through it fast."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "I did three fights in like smaller leagues."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I got signed by Bellator."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I was undefeated for three and a half years."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "I was nine and oh."}, {"time": 1711,

in the world."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "I hadn't really had a competitive match at the end of the Bellator thing."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me, we still haven't had this conversation."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime, chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "He just said, I went to his office and he literally said, we're not interested."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "We're not going to make you an offer."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Did you, did you mention something too about him, about the UFC?"}, {"time": 1749, "text": "That was a year before that."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "That was a year before."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And that might play a role in it, I think."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "So yes, what happened the year before that was I called him a liar, which, but listen, I'm writing this one because he said you can't test for drugs because I'm all natural, which you can tell by my physique."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "And I was always put off by the fact that so many people cheated."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And I was very vocal about that."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And so he had made some statement like, oh, well, there's no way you could test."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "I said, bullshit."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "You, very specifically, I said USADA does it for all other sports worldwide, you can do it."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And then it was funny because I hired USADA a couple of years later."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "So I think he took some offense to that, but that was like a year and almost a year and a half, I think, somewhere, years later."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "It's not like he holds a grudge or anything."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "You can read about it other places."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So I got released from a belt."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "It's not like this is a negotiation."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "I got released from my belt or contract."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "I said, I'm out of here."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "I'm going to go to the UFC."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "I go to Vegas, and then I was told, hey, there's no offer for you."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Tough shit, you know?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So then I ended up signing with one championship."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "I spent, what, three and a half years there."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "I won the belt in my second fight and retained the title the entire time."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And then I just, I think."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "Again, dominating people."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "And so I retired 18 and 0."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "Never, never, and for someone who loves a challenge, never getting to really challenge myself was incredibly frustrating."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And I left the door open."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "I said, if I ever get the chance to prove I'm the best in the world, I'd love to come back."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So somehow, a year later, I get traded."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "Trades have never happened, and this is the one and only trade ever."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "I've been retired for a year."}, {"time": 1850,

saying, okay, if you fight, if you beat George, you're gonna get the title shot against Marty."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And it's like, this is what I've been working for the entire, I've been trying to prove I was the best fighter in the world for the last 10 years, and I've not been afforded this opportunity."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So when I lost to George, that was hard, because it was something that I had waited for for a really, really long time."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "It was something that I thought I could compete for, but I never got the opportunity to do, so that one was hard."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "At the same time, from just the competitive logistically, it's like, he got me with one move."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes, and I got beat a bunch of different ways."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So that was like, fuck, if I get it again, I could have done it, but they're not gonna let me have it again."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year or the next week or whatever."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "You lose at Big Ten, you go to nationals two weeks later."}, {"time": 1905,

definitely would have been a lot of time spent getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?"}, {"time": 1921, "text": "Which I already spent time there, and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip, the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do, was preventing me from doing some things, and it's why, if you look at the fight, I'm bent over as I go for the double leg."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So what happened for people who don't know, you went in for a double leg, and he went."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "Flying knee."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "He did a flying knee, and it caught you well."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "Specifically the way he did that knee was kind of different than the way anyone had thrown flying knees before."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical, whereas he took a few like running steps and went more, you know, the trajectory of the angle was different."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So I think that's kind of probably why it caught, you know, I think a lot of things in combat, well, probably everything, but I focus specifically on combat, happen subconsciously."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Like our brain is reading what's coming at us, and lots of times it's stuff we've seen before so we can judge how to move correctly."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And you misread because it's something you haven't seen before."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "So that loss was really hard."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "With the Burroughs one, I told you, I knew I was gonna lose."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So it was like, whatever, you know?"}, {"time": 1985, "text": "I'm taking this because I want to put the sport of wrestling out there in a big way."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "I wanna help them raise a lot of money."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "We sold at Madison Square Garden, Hulu Theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money."}, {"time":

minutes, okay?"}, {"time": 2428, "text": "If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars."}, {"time": 2433,

you?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "Cause the jackpot."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Well, cause obviously I would put the content somewhere where people would watch it, right?"}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Oh, so you're gonna make money."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "Yeah, so you'd make money that way."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "But it's not exponentially growing, right?"}, {"time": 2462, "text": "It's just going up by like."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people that could pin me."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "So I would either just not choose those people or wait till I get a really large audience and people get really excited and in that case, I'm making a lot of money."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "What do you think, how many matches would go with you, like Khaldech shows up?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "I don't think he could pin me."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "I mean like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me, but he can't pin me."}, {"time": 2485,

last two years."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So you think you can be done on points and just pin them?"}, {"time": 2501, "text": "This is actually one of the issues I have with Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of, people get so mad at me."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Sorry, Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?"}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass and the score is 16 to two, but he can't pin me."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "I'm probably going to pin him."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So I'm better than Jordan Burrows."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Nah, that ain't right."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "He just whooped my ass."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Like if we can go the whole, cause they do submission only."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for, what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?"}, {"time": 2536, "text": "What's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "Something like that, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "He's gonna outscore me significantly."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "He will not pin me, I promise you that."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "So now we go to the overtime."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Strong words, but yeah."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "He won't, Jordan Burrows is not gonna, he's gonna beat me."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I will give you that."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Kyle Dake won't pin you either."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Now David Taylor, he might pin me cause he's a very good pinner also."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "They'll beat me very badly, they will not pin me."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like, right, so in Eddie Bravo you get a rear naked choke or an armbar."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Okay, give me a cradle, I'll probably pin him."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Okay, a good cradle."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "You can say cradle or maybe give them, then they're probably not gonna pin me, right?"}, {"time": 2578, "text": "Maybe, maybe there's a chance, but probably not."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Cause that's just not their specialty."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So for people who don't know, the Eddie Bravo thing is when it goes into overtime, you get a dominance position on a person and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "This is the wrestling equivalent."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "But you take their back or mount."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "Maybe an armbar, yeah, like a wrestling armbar."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So, and I don't think that's very fair."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Cause if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your ass."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And then, you know, and so I think the reason why Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that I don't think, I think they know this, but would admit it."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "I don't think their point scoring system adequately rewards what people value."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So like in wrestling, we value takedowns cause it gets us closer to the pin."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "And the most valuable scoring is a near fall, near to the pin, because that's the ultimate goal to sport."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Whereas in Jiu Jitsu, for example, like if I were to get a takedown, so like if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn't pull guard I would probably get the takedown."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "Now, if somehow he didn't submit me, which he probably would, right?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "But say he got, got close to like 12 submissions, but somehow I slipped out of all of them."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "Now I went to zero, like that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "Like he should very clearly win cause he almost submitted, you know what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "Like there, and I, and I realized the difficulty."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions, but that is the most valuable thing is getting close to finishing the match."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "But okay, so this, this isn't about the sport."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "This is about the Ben Askren challenge that we're talking about."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "What, why 30 minutes?"}, {"time": 2668, "text": "Why not unlimited time?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Why, why go until whenever?"}, {"time": 2673, "text": "Cause then it's just a cardio thing."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Cause at some point then someone would just have to fall over dead, right?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "There's no more skill level involved."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "It's just who can stand up the longest."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "You honestly don't think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "How do you think that's actually going to look?"}, {"time": 2689, "text": "How are they going against you for 30 minutes?"}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So it's going to be kind of boring for the most part."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "What position are you going to be stuck in?"}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Because you, well, you can't, but you can't, you just can't have a gigantic amount of action for 30 minutes."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So I relate to this because some of my kids, when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like, well, but I can't do that for seven minutes."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "And I'm like, well, you know, like say, say if I had you do hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight, as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "You're going to, your pace will slow down, right?"}, {"time": 2720, "text": "So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step here because in wrestling, you're competing against someone."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "So if you're here at a hundred and you go to 80, but they go to 70, that's great."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And then you go to 60, but they go to 40, this is even better, right?"}, {"time": 2732, "text": "Because the gap is growing."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "If they get more tired, that's better."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "So I think most people would know that."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "So they would kind of slow it down."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "But yeah, I think at 30, I mean, I've wrestled 30 minute goes, I've wrestled hour long goes."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "You're not going to get so tired, you're going to fall over in that time period."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "But at some point, if it's unlimited, someone will get so tired or dehydrated that they're just going to freaking fall over."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?"}, {"time": 2766, "text": "You think the other person is always going to be going for the pin and thereby make it dynamic."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Well, if they're working that hard, then they might exhaust themselves, right?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "And obviously then if you're being that dynamic, then you're adding risk to yourself too, because you are doing that."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Well, I love this."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "This is a great idea."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "Well, I figured I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums, or not as great people in the beginning."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "And then I would start bringing in better people because they would be enticed by $20,000, the possibility to win."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "And not much fanfare, just a camera and just local."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "That's it, in my wrestling room."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "And so then maybe you have like, you know, for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds of the most fun things that happen."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes if you want to."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "I mean, I think most people, if they're not really, really elite, I'm probably going to pin them."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "If they're not really elite."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "That's something I've been thinking about."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "This has been like fun for me to think about."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "And obviously it plays in my skill sets because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So, like you said, you weren't very good in your early days until 13, 14."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "What was the switch?"}, {"time": 2844, "text": "You started to dominate people in your college career."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "You dominated."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And obviously you stopped losing at some point."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "So, well, I would say, so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition, I would go in the summers and try to make the world team."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "So, I would lose some, not a lot, right?"}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Minimally."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So, when I'm five, I start playing all sports."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "Like I know you moved to America at what age?"}, {"time": 2873, "text": "So, at least I don't know what it was for you, but in America at my age, you usually play like a sport every season, right?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So, that's what I did in the beginning."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "I had minimal success in wrestling."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "I was kind of chunky."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And then in fifth grade, I don't know."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And I can't tell you, I wanted to be better."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And I told my parents, and this is funny, because now I look at other 11 year olds and very few of them are this mature."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And I actually think emotional maturity is kind of one of the key indicators of how longterm successful someone's gonna be."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And at age 11, I said, I don't wanna play baseball."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball because I wanna wrestle more because I wanna get better at wrestling."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So, at age 11, I quit baseball so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Because that was all that existed at that point in time."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "You couldn't wrestle in June, July, or any of those other months."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "What was that desire to get better?"}, {"time": 2919, "text": "So, it's not about winning."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I don't know where it came from."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I just wanted to get better."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "I wanna get better."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "I wanna be good at this."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "I wanna be really good at this."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "So, when you're looking at kids now as a coach, you're looking for that."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And I wanna try to also inspire that."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "I mean, honestly, I think as a coach, that's probably my biggest job is to get a kid and get them to believe I can do this."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "Because if I can do this, well, I can do that."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I can do that too, right?"}, {"time": 2948, "text": "And there's so many kids who, unfortunately, have shitty parents or bad teachers that tell them, you suck, you can't be anything, right?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So, I think my biggest goal as a coach is to get someone to believe they can do it."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it, they're the most fun, but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?"}, {"time": 2965, "text": "The ones who think they can are the ones that need me the most."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Because they need someone to, let's go."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "So, I don't know what inspired me."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "At age 11, fifth grade, I quit."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "So, then I started having more success where I'm like, say, placing at the state tournament."},

football."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Same reason."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "It's like, well, I need to put more time into this."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "My parents, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "So, we have a year round club, and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity to go to a club year round."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "So, we had a mat in my basement."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "I had to go find, hey, you wanna come wrestle?"}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Yeah, to find partners for myself."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "What'd you do?"}, {"time": 3023, "text": "Did you drill?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Did you live wrestle?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "What'd you do in that basement?"}, {"time": 3026, "text": "So, actually, I think, you'll enjoy this."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "I think the start of my scrambling was kind of based around that."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So, I got kind of, I think it's probably my freshman sophomore."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year, I found two kids who were really consistent who would come out, like you would come out on, he would come out on Tuesday, and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?"}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And they would come every week, and they were really consistent partners for me to have in the summer."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "But they weren't nearly as good as me."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "They were way worse."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "So, it's like, okay, how do I, how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling for them to come back?"}, {"time": 3065, "text": "Because if I just whoop their ass, they're not gonna come back, you know?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could, and I thought they could do a takedown before not getting it, and then try to like escape or get out."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So, obviously, if I let them get really close, sometimes they get it, you know?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "So, they're enjoying it."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?"}, {"time": 3085, "text": "And that was kind of like the start, because I had to figure my way out of bad positions, because I had to try to make it entertaining for them, where they still got something out of it, and they wanted to come back the next week."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And I also got something out of it."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Yeah, I love this, yeah."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "Because that relationship is so important, with that, like, that, I've had a few drilling partners, training partners that were really important to my life, and I always wonder why it's difficult, why it's so difficult to find them."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like I, if anyone's listening to this, I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "Getting the reps with people is hard."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "Even in jiu jitsu, that, it's just like, people want to do the fun stuff."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "They don't want to really put in the work, and it takes a certain kind of personality."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And then you also have to make it fun for the other person, just like you said."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "If there's a skill mismatch, but also if you have an interest mismatch, in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do, all that kind of stuff, you have to figure out ways to make it fun."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "So you did."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So, yeah, I think I did that, and no one told me."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "As I get some, I get frustrated, because now we have, just in my academy, we probably have 50, 60 high school kids only that are year round."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "They're year round."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Maybe they're not consistent in the summer or whatever, but they're there."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "So when they don't have a great partner, they start whining, and it's like, you little bitches, like, you know."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Some days they get really mad about it, because it's like, I had no partners."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "You guys, there's still 22 people in the room."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you, but like, go work out with that dude."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So what was the switch, the change?"}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Was it gradual, or?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "Gradual."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Yeah, so I was in ninth grade."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "I quit football, because I wanted to get really serious."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "What position in football were you in?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "I was actually a nose tackle."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "But at that point, so, okay, so I was also, the other thing I kind of left out here, I was really fat growing up."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat, and if I want to be a competitive wrestler, I shouldn't be fat, because weight matters."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So I was pretty small, too, but I was also slow, unfortunately."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So they put me a nose tackle."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "So that's where you wrestled, 119?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "My freshman year, yeah."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success state wise, but not nationally."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "It's my national success, didn't come to my junior year in high school."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And then senior year, I started having a lot of success nationally, and I got recruited."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "But then even when my freshman year of college, this is where I loved competing, I would go every weekend."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "Because I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition, all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them, and then figuring out what you need to work on."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman, which is incredibly rare."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "I had 10 losses."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "So it's not, and like to not so great guys, you know?"}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So like my skill level still at that point was not that great."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And then the next year I came out and I made it into the finals."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "So my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year to the real freshman year."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So a few questions."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "Where did the funk style of wrestling, the creative stuff get developed, at which stage?"}, {"time": 3284, "text": "So I think like looking retroactively, there was no intention to start when I was in high school with those kids, but I think that's kind of like, well, what was happening, right?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So what I would really say is, I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college named Mike Ironman, great guy."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "I had this burning desire to be the best."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room, cause we had, you know, Tyron was there, we had All American 157, we had All American 184."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "So I wasn't having a ton of success."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And very quickly I realized from like a more traditional athletic perspective, strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with anyone."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "I was way worse."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?"}, {"time": 3327, "text": "You know, I want to do this."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "How do I do this?"}, {"time": 3329, "text": "There's gotta be a way, you know?"}, {"time": 3331, "text": "So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things, but then it was just like this creative expansion for the next, you know, say three to five years."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And then even now it's like, I don't know, there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo, or there's something that's like fun about the way the body moves and works and exploring something new and thinking about, hey, wrestling's been happening at a relatively high level for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "And there's still new things being developed."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "And so when you see something new, you're like, oh damn, like, that's great."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Or like Jason Knowles may have to win Dixie."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "I'm like, how did I not think of that shit?"}, {"time": 3367, "text": "Like, why did I think of that?"}, {"time": 3368, "text": "So easy, I should have thought of that, you know?"}, {"time": 3371, "text": "So there's this like obsession with the sport of wrestling and positions where I actually think sometimes, thank God we didn't have smartphones because I may have been distracted by my smartphone."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Maybe I wouldn't have been because I was so obsessed, but maybe, but you know, some days I had, couldn't finish the single leg on a specific person or maybe they were finishing on me and it was like, go home and I was just fucking obsessed about that one position."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Like, okay, what am I missing here?"}, {"time": 3398, "text": "And not just accepting like that whatever the coach says is the answer, but like, what am I missing?"}, {"time": 3403, "text": "What ways can my body move that no one's told me it can move yet?"}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Where can my arms go, right?"}, {"time": 3410, "text": "Where can I do all these things?"}, {"time": 3411, "text": "And so I would just obsess about these things."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day and you say, oh, well maybe this, you know, and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, maybe it works twice and it doesn't work the next time."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And so you kind of like have this creative process and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things that are on the cutting room floor that never made it to the light because you thought they'd be good and they failed and they sucked."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "And then, you know, to the point where, like my senior year, I got to this point where the people, then they were just figures."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Figures would wrestle in my head about positions I was thinking about."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "I wouldn't tell them what to do."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "They would just, they'd just go in my head."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "And then like, oh fuck, wait, that's it."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "That's it, like that just happened."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "That's the move and then I'd go try to practice and sure enough, boom, that's the move."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "That's exactly what you have Alpha Zero playing, learning chess."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "You have, it's called Self Plays."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "You have, did the figures have like a clear?"}, {"time": 3463, "text": "No faces, they were just like."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Did they have a human form or is it just like stick figures essentially?"}, {"time": 3468, "text": "Yeah, it was not like humans."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "It was more like stick figures."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "They weren't stick figures exactly like they were."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "They had some volume?"}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Yeah, it was like a gray person and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially so I had to see how the things moved and yeah."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind at Google are, I don't know if you've seen, but there's something called reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence where you have like, they've done it for like sumo wrestling."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "You have like, you have these two stick figures that don't even know how to get up at first and they figure out how to stand on their two feet and then they figure out how to push the other person off of the pedestal."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Wait, so, but what about like when you look at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "So are they doing that same program or no?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded so it's not learning the, all of the sophisticated movements and strategies like high level strategies and movement, that's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do and if it does it, like the parkour stuff, that's all hard coded in."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "People like project and think like these robots have like discovered like how to move in sophisticated ways they haven't."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "Well, that's what, when you and John were talking about the grappling robot."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chess, right?"}, {"time": 3566, "text": "If a chess piece moves, right?"}, {"time": 3568, "text": "The horse can move like an L, right?"}, {"time": 3571, "text": "It can only move like an L. It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second or seven meters per second."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "It can only move there, right?"}, {"time": 3578, "text": "Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "I can shoot at different angles."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?"}, {"time": 3588, "text": "I can shoot with my head up versus my head, I mean, right?"}, {"time": 3591, "text": "All these things are gonna matter."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "We're talking about a human being defending the single leg."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "All of those things are gonna matter and that's where human beings who wrestle are calculating those things subconsciously."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head, oh, the force is coming at me at this, so I need to do that, right?"}, {"time": 3607, "text": "They're just doing it because."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely, if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling, you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves and the power that it's able to deliver."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "So that presumably, that'll be the limitation."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "But then, so if we go human, max force, we're Jordan Burrows double, max force, right?"}, {"time": 3630, "text": "That's the highest, that's the highest we get and then we go down from there."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "Even within that, it's like sometimes, I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of, I don't know, we'll just say 20 is the number, right?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "I don't know, I'll shoot it at 20 because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15, sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Because you feel something in your opponent that makes you do it differently."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So they would have to learn how, and then all of these different things and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "So the robot would have to learn all of these different incoming inputs to the system and then create this reaction."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "Oh no, no, no, 100%."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "So this would be all continuous."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "So unlike chess, it would not be, it's just chess is discrete, there's, it's."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "One and then."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "You move, it's a very specific set of moves."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Now here you would, those are all variables you control and they're continuous variables."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So the speed, the force, there's actuators, so there's all these joints, right?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "But you can move."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "I mean, it's just an optimization problem."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "It's kind of, and it's fascinating."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So I've been fascinated thinking about it since you guys talked about it."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "It was a long time ago, I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago and I've kind of been like obsessing about it ever since."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "Yeah, it just changes when, so unlike boxing, for example, or striking, once you grab a hold of somebody, it changes, you're now one body, right?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So it's very complicated."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "I think that's the really interesting thing about humans is we're able to do all of this calculation."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Subconsciously."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Yeah, subconsciously."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of for a robot, it's just there's so many things."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "The big problem is ethically, I don't know how many people are willing to train with a robot because you're gonna get hurt."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Well, couldn't you make a robot train as a robot or no?"}, {"time": 3816, "text": "Yes, but then it's expensive."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "So, because they're gonna get."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "Put the padding on that thing."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "I know, but then it's not, you know, it's, then you're not capturing the full."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them, you know, something for that effect?"}, {"time": 3834, "text": "You could, I mean, you could, you could."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "I mean, you're talking about robots that are, these are humanoid robots, so we're talking about $500,000 million robots."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "So, you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money because you have to have them wrestle for like a lot."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "To get better."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "Yeah, to get better."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "And then, the open question is how long does it take to get good enough to be a human?"}, {"time": 3872, "text": "I don't think we understand, I don't know, I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "Like, is it a really hard problem?"}, {"time": 3879, "text": "Like, what's harder, chess or wrestling?"}, {"time": 3881, "text": "Wrestling, by far."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "That's, yeah, that's the sense I have."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And possibilities, so once I shoot the same leg, now you have X amount of choices."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Once you make your choice, now I have a choice, X amount of choices."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "Now you have X amount of choices on the defense, and we can just keep going back and forth, right?"}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And this number becomes."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "Yeah, but the same happens with chess."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Correct, but then in wrestling, you have to make these movements very instantaneously, right, because if I shoot a single leg, I'm not gonna wait and say, what's your defense?"}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Right, you have to be instantaneously."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And then, also, again, based on the force and the vectors and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "So really, you know, if you're saying, well, I can shoot a single leg, it's not like moving the chess, it's not one move, right?"}, {"time": 3924, "text": "If you want to talk about different forces and stuff, it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves based on how hard I shoot it, the angle, the direction, all of those things."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Yeah, but wait a minute."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "People probably know the physiology of this, but the reaction speed for a human is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that, I don't know, from sensation to, like, from the signal traveling up to your brain and down, I don't know what that number is, but robots certainly could do it way faster."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "You would actually have to, like, constrain the speed."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people, right, so, yeah, theoretically, they could eventually beat wrestlers, but you asked what was harder, wrestling or chess."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Yeah, and I think wrestling is, because of the time component in it and the physicality of, you know, is it this force or that force, you know?"}, {"time": 3978, "text": "Because if I'm gonna say we're in a seatbelt side by side, right, a wrestling seatbelt, not in Jiu Jitsu, based on the pressure you're giving me, I might do a bunch of different things, right?"}, {"time": 3987, "text": "And so, like, to an untrained eye, they might both look like the same thing from you."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "To a trained feel, it's like, well, in one case, it's really evident I should go this way, in another case, it's really evident I should go that way."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "So the other thing to consider, just like with chess, the AI systems, so human versus human play a certain way together."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "They actually haven't considered a really large number of strategies that AI systems discover."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "So one possibility with a robot, they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "That, like, will dominate no matter what the human does."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "You think that, so you think there's that, so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking about with the wrestling, so fun is there's, even after 80, 90 years, there's this continuous evolution."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "So you think."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "There'll be some, like, low single type thing, like John Smith type of situation."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "Well, like a down block go behind is something that has really, I would say really in the last fiveish years has really been evolved."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "What's a go behind?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "Down block go behind, so when you shoot, well, they just, head inside or head outside matters, but there's one for both."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "And then, so that was kind of in existence when I was in college, right?"}, {"time": 4054, "text": "You down block them and you stop, but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "And now, immediately, you shoot and I attack that shoulder and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?"}, {"time": 4063, "text": "And so, like, that in its current incarnation, it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "I would say it probably became popular five to seven years ago."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "So yeah, there's these big things that are happening."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "Now I really wanna roll back because I wanna be ahead of the game."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "I wanna know what I'm missing."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces much more than humans do."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "So it'll give you a piece."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And not only does it give you a piece, it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Because it knows that that's better for the long term."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "So like humans rarely sacrifice without getting the piece back, like two or three moves after."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "Alpha Zero can wait like five moves."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "So basically you'll have, potentially with wrestling, you might have a robot that like puts itself in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way then that will actually turn out."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Lures the opponent in to trap."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "That's what my style is based on."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "You basically narrow, one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "You put yourself in a bad position, but it narrows the set of choices."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "For them, because they're not used to it."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "Yeah, they're not used to it."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And then you drag them into your, yeah."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "So, but there's also, the problem is there's mechanical issues."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Like it's actually just difficult to build robots that are able to sense, because we have sensation throughout our body, yeah."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "It's just difficult to build that kind of robot."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "It's expensive."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "You start talking about multimillion dollars, and then people start asking you questions."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "Why did you invest all of this money?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "They wanna see what moves they do, duh, hello."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "It could be a better investment."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "So I mentioned John Smith."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "He is, if people don't know, one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "He's also creative like you."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "He spoke really highly of you."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "Did you guys ever work together?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So you know what, when I was a senior, and I had the people wrestling in my head, I was lucky enough to be doing, I was pretty much a graduate, so I did an independent study with the sports psychology."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I was potentially going to go to grad school for sports psychology."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "Well, I actually did nine credits, and then I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "I continued learning on my own."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "But I had an independent study with the guy who's the head of USA Track and Field Sports Psych."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "So here was the class was, I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour, and he was like fascinated by me."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So he didn't let me do homework."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "It was like the greatest three credits ever."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "We just talked."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "I learned so much."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "But so I started, so one time it came up, I had these robot, or people wrestling in my head, and he said, well, who else do you think, but John Smith happened."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "So I went and got John Smith's number, and I called him and said, hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?"}, {"time": 4232, "text": "And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching, they went away."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Same thing happened to me."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "As soon as I started coaching, they went away."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "So if I really force myself now, and I'm like, I see something in practice, and it's really higher level, because high school wrestling, I don't want to, maybe I feel bad, but it's a little bit lower level, right?"}, {"time": 4248, "text": "So if Keegan, for example, who won the tournament, if he's struggling with a problem or asks me a question, and I can force myself to see the bodies moving and think about it again, kind of like I was in early age, but it won't just flow there anymore."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head, how are they generating new ideas?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "Are they just kind of?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "You tell me."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "So it's just, they're just scrambling in your head?"}, {"time": 4284, "text": "It would be specifically based on a problem I was struggling with, or a specific position, you know?"}, {"time": 4290, "text": "It goes in for a single, and then go from there."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class, and I don't have to work that hard, because it's easy, right?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And yeah, I'm just sitting there acting like I'm looking at the board, and these guys are wrestling, and I'm watching them wrestle, and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "Is there somebody you look up to style wise?"}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "Probably Gable, or it's a Gable."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "John Smith, but after the fact."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So the problem with wrestling in my era was you couldn't watch it."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "There was no access, right?"}, {"time": 4326, "text": "It wasn't really available."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith, man, they're kind of hard to find, right?"}, {"time": 4331, "text": "There's a couple of them on YouTube, but I've obviously seen all of those, but in my era, there really wasn't any of it."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So it was hard to be a fan of something, and that's why wrestling has, the fans are going like this, because now you can flip on the Flow app, and you can watch something that's happening in Europe, right?"}, {"time": 4349, "text": "We can do this easily, so we can be a fan of people."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then, because there just was no access."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "So now I can watch someone I like, and say, oh shit, that guy's wrestling."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "That type of thing."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "You know, and a quick rant."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "It's really frustrating that you can't watch the Olympics."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Oh my god, it's so frustrating."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on this point."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "Go to NBC's

"text": "Most matches, you can't see, even, you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steelers, and you can't see the full match."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "You get like a crappy highlight."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "So the two biggest things, and really the three, the NCAA championships on ESPN, the Olympic trials are on NBC, and the Olympics are on NBC."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "And these companies are so big, they don't have a department dedicated to selling the rights to that footage, right?"}, {"time": 4411, "text": "So the rights to wrestling footage, which no one really cares all that much about, except a niche, are the exact same as track and field, or basketball in the Olympics."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics, you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Yeah, old, the current film."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So you can't even watch the Gable match?"}, {"time": 4434, "text": "The Gable Steelers, no."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "They did a, you know, they do something that annoys the fuck out of me."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "So it's like they capture the most important thing, but it's all about the buildup."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat, and the nerves, and you walk out, and like that, I mean, I don't know, you miss, then when the triumph happens, or the heartbreak happens, it has that much more power."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN, I'm happy to join that."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "I think I'm fortunate it's the IOC."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?"}, {"time": 4477, "text": "IOC is selling, for the Olympics, is the one that's making."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "Well, so NBC broadcasts, so they obviously have the live rights."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "You would think they would have recorded, if they, I mean, they're the ones recording it, you would think they keep the rights when you think."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "No, no, no, they're getting a license of it."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "They're getting exclusive like license, but like the, you know, for example, I've had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player, and there's a really sort of famous match, just a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics, where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "It's a 20 minute match to go to war, and that's not available anywhere, but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "The reason I know this is on the IOC channel."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "So they've uploaded all of these matches."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "They have it and put it up."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won, got put public, and so I don't know if it was private, it got put up on YouTube."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "I was allergic to it the week of my Jake Paul fight."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "It was so dumb."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "I'm like, why, this is 13 years later, this is bullshit."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Like this should have been up."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So, I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?"}, {"time": 4551, "text": "That has to be the USOC then or NBC?"}, {"time": 4555, "text": "So I know like, okay, so I know Flow, right?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Cause I worked with them."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "They buy the rights, generally in the contract, they'll have rights to both live stream it and then use that footage at any point moving forward."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So those matches live on Flow's website."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "That's why I would be surprised if NBC didn't have something similar."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "Flow does a pretty good job of providing like a place where you can watch all these matches."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "NBC does not."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Does not, yeah."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "And also there's an argument with Flow as well, but certainly with Olympics."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "There's a difference between what Flow does and what the Olympics represent."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "Like it feels like the Olympics, which is what the charter says, should be as accessible as possible."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "Like you should really lower the barrier for entry for the Olympics."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "You know that's what the charter says, but those people in the IOC, these are the worst people ever."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "They're very bad."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "Well, they're not bad."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "They just lost touch of the dream they once had when they joined the IOC."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "Well, I would argue all the way back that these are rich fat cats who, like I get so mad about the NCAA, which finally now got rid of this bullshit term amateurism."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "It's like, well, there's some holy grail where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete, but the people who own the IOC or the people who own the institutions, college institutions are making boatloads of money off of you, that's crap."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "Did you believe you can win gold?"}, {"time": 4647, "text": "So your mental game was on point."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "Yeah, I was ready."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "This wasn't good enough."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "That was what I said."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time, it was my first year of international competition."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "So when I came out in 2007, it was my first time making 74 kilograms, which is pretty small for me."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around

competitive."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "I beat a bunch of other guys who were good and had passed decent results."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "So I knew I was right there."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora, and I had someone do scouting reports for him, actually my

"text": "So in your division was, like you said, it's the T of, if I said it's the T of, that guy's special."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "He's very special."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier who I enjoyed watching, and that was a guy I, again, it was kind of after the fact because it was hard to access footage, but he was a lot of fun to watch."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "What do you think made him great?"}, {"time": 4755, "text": "A lot of people talk about him as potentially one of the greatest ever."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "I mean, so he won six and three, six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total, which there's only one or two people above that."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him, but from what I've seen, his feel is different."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "He was just ahead of his time, and the feel and the touch he had for certain moves and different things, because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "He's taller than skinnier, which it can work in wrestling, but it is by less represented."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "So yeah, he was special, so good."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "Do you take any inspiration from, let's talk about Dagestan in general."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "What do you think makes those wrestlers great?"}, {"time": 4804, "text": "Have you read the book, The Talent Code?"}, {"time": 4807, "text": "And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots all around the world."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "So now obviously with our wrestling academies, we try to take some lessons from that and apply it."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "I got to assume, they didn't cover Dagestan in that book specifically, but I got to assume a lot of the same principles that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "They did South Korea and women's golf."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "They did Curacao in baseball."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "They picked a lot of these other places that were really elite."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "I think it was maybe Moscow in women's tennis also."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "So I think all of these things that make any group great organization is probably the same things that's happening there."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Well, the hardship, I mean, is there something specific about wrestling that can create so many great champions?"}, {"time": 4854, "text": "From that area?"}, {"time": 4855, "text": "So obviously they all love the big deal."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "Wrestling specifically is a big deal there."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "They do Sambo also, obviously."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "So that's part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "They obviously are rough tumble, tough life."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "Getting a lot of fights."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "And then I think that also that a lot of them, it is a way out right there."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "The elite level athletes in that part of the world, from my understanding, are really well compensated compared to what the average person makes and they're treated really well."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So people see it as a way out."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Whereas like, and then honestly, if America is getting better, but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA was because I didn't want to be poor my whole life."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "It sucked."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000 for the next 48 years."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "So I'm going to go do something else."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?"}, {"time": 4901, "text": "If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling, I probably would have kept wrestling."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "So I think there's factors and obviously now they have a really like, a bunch of really good people in one area."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So there's probably, and it's been going on for a long time."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "So there's probably been a bunch of like adults and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So yeah, a lot of those things that happen."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "So I'm definitely going to travel there to talk to them because I can speak Russian."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "It makes it very, makes me uniquely qualified to."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "My brother can speak a little bit of Russian."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Your brother can?"}, {"time": 4936, "text": "Okay, like a little bit like he swears and."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me oversell."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "I think he would be able to have a conversation with you."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Probably not like you."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "What's the, what's the reason he knows Russian?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "I don't know why he got obsessed with languages."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And so his college degree is actually, what are they called?"}, {"time": 4957, "text": "Interdis, where you have three minors."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish and maybe Japanese, I'm messing up."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "I don't know what the third one is."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling, like they don't really go super hard."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "Yeah, and I only spent a couple, so I was there, I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "That was where the World Cup was."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "We had to train there for like two days afterwards."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "So I didn't get to dig deep, dig deep into what was going on or anything."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe it to be really simple."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "If we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "If we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "There's all this gray area in the middle that's sparring, right?"}, {"time": 5017, "text": "So if you have a good relationship, like college me and my brother, we could just go and we know where each other's at."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "We don't even have to talk about it, right?"}, {"time": 5026, "text": "But like in my wrestling club, I'll say, okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot and this is for him, so I want him to go 70."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "So you're not supposed to be trying to win here."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "You're gonna go a little later."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "I want you to give him some looks, you know?"}, {"time": 5043, "text": "So I think it has really taken hold in America."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "I think it's really beneficial for success."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And I think that's, I mean, America's doing better than we've ever done historically."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "Well, that 70 and 40, that's like an art form to find that right place, because the really good people I've trained with, they go much closer to 100% speed wise, but without forcing things the way you would when you're going."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "It's some weird combination of things that, like if you truly earn a technique, then you're given that technique."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "But if you don't, you don't."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And then it becomes much less injury prone."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "You don't get stuck in positions."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "It's just a lot of movement."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about, like different ways to learn and get better."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "And so I think John obviously innovated within the sport of jiu jitsu."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "I think about it like."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "You have this academy and you sent me this plan."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "They have like a really well thought through plan for how to develop a good wrestler."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So I think it's, for me there's four categories, right?"}, {"time": 5116, "text": "There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "You're coming in and I'm showing you the move and you're literally going out there and you're trying."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "To me, that's not even drilling."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "That's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So obviously in someone's earlier periods, they're spending a lot of time in that phase because they literally don't even know how to move their bodies the right way."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling because you absolutely have to get those reps to become really proficient in that movement and then the sparring and then the live, right?"}, {"time": 5148, "text": "And so like, I think obviously by the time you get to the kind of, I don't wanna say end point, right?"}, {"time": 5153, "text": "But further on, the time you spend teaching is so, I don't wanna say, I'm sorry, in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant, but it's so much smaller because to someone who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years, I don't have to give this big long drawn out explanation."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently or just do this, right?"}, {"time": 5173, "text": "We don't have to spend any time there."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "So I think that's like something that consumes for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13, we're consuming a massive amount of time there on that teaching learning phase."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "But that makes total sense, right?"}, {"time": 5191, "text": "It's funny because when you look at like jiu jitsu schools, they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning and then the live, like there's not enough drilling."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "I like how you draw a distinction there because it feels like you're always starting from scratch."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "Like people have like very crappy short term memory."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "Like they're not, like the way teaching is done is you show a technique from scratch and it seems disjoint."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "It is for sure, especially if you have a class that's been with you for a while, you don't have to start from scratch."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "You can say, hey, let's focus on this one little thing here or let's, after we do this, let's do that, and you kind of put, start putting it all together."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "And then with jiu jitsu, the thing that I really struggled with was a couple of things."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu jitians, my personal experience through the sport."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And I actually found my, so when I unretired, I found someone really great that I loved and I really wish it was Mark Lehman."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "I don't know if you know him at all."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "I wish I would have found him earlier because he was just tremendous."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "But number one, there's no drilling."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "So it's like, in wrestling, I can boil down to, I can probably name you the best six moves, right?"}, {"time": 5260, "text": "So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "It always has been, I don't know, probably always will be, unless they figure out something different."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "The robot."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "The robot figures out something different."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "Because everyone's gonna do that, right?"}, {"time": 5278, "text": "So just like, say, an armbar or some type of sweep, right?"}, {"time": 5282, "text": "Why can't we go get 50 reps there?"}, {"time": 5283, "text": "Hey, by the time I've been in your jiu jitsu school for two years, I better know a fucking armbar."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "I better know it."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "Just tell me to go hit 50 reps. And then if, when I'm hitting my reps, if there's something I'm doing wrong, then just say, hey, Ben, move your leg a little bit that way or raise your hips up a little more, right?"}, {"time": 5301, "text": "Like, correct as you're drilling so you're getting all these reps at it so you're becoming more proficient."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "And then the other thing I really struggled with was, to your point during live, so many times it's just this five minute go, go, go."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "And that's not the most efficient way to learn because when you have two people, especially when they're focused on winning, and you say go, they're gonna go to wherever they do best."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something, I don't want you doing what you do best all the time."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "I need you doing some other things, right?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "If you have a great single leg but you can't shoot to the other side of the body, we need to work on that, right?"}, {"time": 5332, "text": "You need to start shooting the other side."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "There's some sense that you, it's not like you should be told what to work on but you should be told to work on the thing that you wanna work on."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "Meaning, I don't know, maybe you can comment on this, but everybody develops a different game as you get better and better."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "There's a set of things you need to be working on."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So I actually have, like when I, especially when I'm training very seriously, I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind and I have a sheet of paper on the side where I literally, my head keep counting off how many times I put myself in that position and pulled off the technique."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And that's all I care about in like training."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "So I'll just, whatever it is, if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine, arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don't, I love numbers, so I'll say like, I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags and I'm not getting off the mat until I do."}, {"time": 5389, "text": "And that, you know, if it takes."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "Any thrilling or live contest?"}, {"time": 5393, "text": "So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now is the live contest."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "But drilling, obviously, drilling."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "So I feel like I can't find a drilling part, like it's so hard to find drilling partners, even."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "It's annoying to me that this is boring."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "And there's nothing more annoying to me than the look of boredom on another person's face when we're drilling."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "It's like, don't you."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?"}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Cause you said it's a job."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "And he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "Why am I, am I an idiot?"}, {"time": 5421, "text": "Or why is this drilling beneficial?"}, {"time": 5423, "text": "Well, let's go with two trick questions."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "Why is it so beneficial?"}, {"time": 5428, "text": "I think for me, it's, there's a meditative aspect to it where the more you drill, the more you start noticing the details."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "Let me push back a little bit here."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "I'm not going to push back all the way."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "Cause every time, if I was wrestling, I'll warm up my head, crotch, shin, leg, whatever, right?"}, {"time": 5449, "text": "But even, so say like at a high level when I'm really wrestling, say 10 years ago, even during that drill portion, if we talk about the resistance of our opponent from zero to 100, it's very likely that my partner at that point, and this is people I'm really comfortable with, they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?"}, {"time": 5467, "text": "They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl or, you know, I got to get through their hands."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "If I don't set it up right, they might put their arm down, right?"}, {"time": 5474, "text": "So it's like, we are drilling cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level, but there's a little bit of sparring."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "Yeah, so that's not really drilling."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "Cause I think it's drilling."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "I think literally you're shooting and I'm just going boom, I'm like, show me your dummy, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "No, but it's very hard to be a dummy that doesn't do 20%, so you're going to do 20%."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "Yeah, that's so, so yes, that's 20%."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "So that's like sparring a little bit then."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "No, but they're not really resisting."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "They're just giving you the right frame."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "They're giving you the right like movement and they're being an intelligent dummy, essentially."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "I mean, but also like the really important component of this is you pick the techniques for which is beneficial."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it, you don't want to be doing that with, I'm saying like there's certain moves and I like those moves and I select the game base in those moves."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "So are you drilling to get better or are you drilling just to work out?"}, {"time": 5532, "text": "No, to get better."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "That's what I'm trying to tell you."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "I believe you can become like exceptionally good very fast by drilling."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "But how?"}, {"time": 5542, "text": "First of all, let me ask you an empirical question."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times a particular move?"}, {"time": 5551, "text": "You haven't drilled millions."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I think you're just saying numbers."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "I don't think you know what 100,000."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "The numbers are freaking astronomical."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "It's way more than 10,000."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "Dude, there was a 10 year period where I wrestled every single day."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "That's 3,000 days, so you're telling me 10,000, that's only three of them a day."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "I do way more than that."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Three of them."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "Probably 30 of them a day."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "That's 100,000."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "Yeah, hundreds of thousands."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "I did, for sure, 100%."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Because some days I might do 100, right?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "So 30 of 30 is not very many."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "Especially if we count all reps, if we're counting drilling and live."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot and I just hated it."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "You shoot a high crotch, we'll start."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Coach wants to drill a high crotch."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "Okay, we'll start."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "You shoot the high crotch, that's great."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "Then I'm gonna sit the corner or I'm gonna give you my hip or I'm gonna try something."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "So then you have to react."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And I would argue that all skill level past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5616, "text": "It's back and forth."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5618, "text": "I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 5619, "text": "And you have to start unconsciously programming these things in your head."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "Because if you're too conscious to think about it, it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it at math."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "But the drilling is the unconscious programming."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "But the simple movement, the first simple movement, the first simple movement, that single leg or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "Like I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain at doing other things around it."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "No, but that's the key word, you feel."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "That's your opinion."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "If we did a study on it, then I would be proven correct."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "No, perhaps."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "So first of all, your brain, as an exceptionally creative combat athlete, it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Like it's obvious that you have like, you're such a creative energy that you're just not going to be somebody who's going to enjoy that."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So enjoyment is probably having an active mind is really important."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And I have that mind."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "Like I can."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "But do you really think, okay, so if you're, let's pick a technique."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "What technique do you want to drill on?"}, {"time": 5693, "text": "Are we doing jiu jitsu or wrestling?"}, {"time": 5696, "text": "It's hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "Let me think, just guard pass."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Okay, so you have a guard pass and you get it to be, I'd say nine and a half out of 10, right, just from a technical standpoint."}, {"time": 5709, "text": "Don't you think you need some resistance to feel?"}, {"time": 5712, "text": "Because essentially all benefit after that is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?"}, {"time": 5718, "text": "And if they shift that way, do I need to sink here or move there?"}, {"time": 5721, "text": "So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing, but maybe terminology wise."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "Well, the split is the important thing."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "Like how much of each?"}, {"time": 5730, "text": "So I think it is spar."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "Like I think it's a very light touch spar is what you're talking about, which is in my opinion, really isn't drilling."}, {"time": 5738, "text": "And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency, I don't think brings much value."}, {"time": 5743, "text": "But that's what I'm trying to tell you is I think it does."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "I think doing that same movement, I think you begin to learn more over time."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "Like you're saying like once you get the basic proficiency, then there's a diminishing returns."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "I think everything has diminishing returns when you're learning a technique."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling, if you can have way more gains over here, why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?"}, {"time": 5776, "text": "If this other area, if you're spending so much time here that this other area is left unexplored, you can make gigantic gains over there."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "No, but you're gonna lose."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "I think a lot depends on your style."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "I think a lot is determined by how good you are at one thing."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing and then make your whole game where it's all pulled into that system, then I don't know."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "I think one is too small of a number."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "Yeah, it's small."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I feel like you can't be easily this, like I've."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "Funnels."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "Funnels, right?"}, {"time": 5811, "text": "Where everything goes into a few positions."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And then it's all field."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "Where I feel you win 100%."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy 80% of the time and 20% of the time live rolling with people worse than you."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Like a little bit worse than you."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "Or a lot worse than you."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Yeah, so I think, I definitely think."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "So my buildup would be teach."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "So we're talking a complex technique, right?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "So by the time we're talking about, we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient, he's probably done the drilling part."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So then now it's like, okay, if I wanna get something new to you, I'll probably tell you, you'll probably be able to do the basic premise within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?"}, {"time": 5855, "text": "Do this, okay, they do it."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "Then it's like, okay, so now here from here, what we're gonna do, we're gonna go light sparring."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So I know you have success."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "Cause I need you to complete the task in order to get better at it."}, {"time": 5864, "text": "That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up, is they just wanna go with the toughest person."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "But if you go with the toughest person, you're not gonna actually execute on any skills."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "You're gonna get a workout and I need you to execute cause I need you to get good at this."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "In order to get good at it, you have to get all the way through the technique."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "Why do you need them to complete?"}, {"time": 5878, "text": "Just so they gain confidence in the technique or they go through all this stuff?"}, {"time": 5881, "text": "They have to feel all the way through."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "Like if I said, learn a high crotch when you're drilling but stop halfway every time."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "But you're not actually gonna be able to do it cause you're gonna stop, you're not gonna feel."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "So, you know, try it on someone, spar lightly, get it."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Do it on someone who's not as good as you, get it."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Then kind of work your way up the ladder so you can get it on someone your own skill level or maybe better than you, right, in a live competition."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So it's like, I don't know, I feel like that basic drilling, so a kid like Keegan who I've brought up a few times, I feel like if there's something new, I could literally tell him, this is what I want you to do and he's such a great feeler, he could go drill it proficiently within probably a minute or two."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "But then to hit it on someone high level, that's gonna take quite a while longer."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "And that's a mix of drilling and sparring on people a little bit worse than you."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "Yeah, and then equal and then better, yeah."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Yeah, because there's this, with grappling, there's such like a feel component to the pressure, the movement, all these things."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And there's still, like I said, there's so many things you can throw at someone out of one position, not just moves, but moves at a different level of force or whatever."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Are you and these kids developing like a big picture strategy of like, what are the main setups and take downs and just like a whole system?"}, {"time": 5961, "text": "So I kind of sent you our technique book, right, how we kind of go at approach it."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "So I think in wrestling, you're going to need, you're gonna need a handful of things just off the word go, right?"}, {"time": 5974, "text": "You're going to, so I think on our feet, I need to be able to take this out of the body."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "I need to be able to take that out of the body."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "I need to be able to bring you underneath me."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "I need to be able to go around you, right?"}, {"time": 5984, "text": "Now we can accomplish those different ways, but we should have all of those weapons if we wanna be really good some way, right?"}, {"time": 5991, "text": "So if I neglect one of those, so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down, right?"}, {"time": 5994, "text": "Front lock you."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "Now, if I have a good shot and you're smart, you're just gonna lower your stance."}, {"time": 5999, "text": "So my shot is not gonna be as successful and I have the inability to pull you down, right?"}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So I kind of need all of those so I can, as they get better, I can point those things out."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "On bottom, my folks at bottom, there's certain things like you have to be good at leg right defense, right?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "You have to, I mean, at a high level or you're just gonna, when you get it in, you're just getting stuck there."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "Not gonna be able to escape."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things that you can choose from and I'm gonna, depending on your body style and what you're good and bad at, I'm gonna probably develop something a little different."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod, you'd be better at the knee slide, whatever."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "Yeah, top, kind of same thing."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "I have to ask you about Khabib."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "So I remember a while ago Rogan said that that's the perfect fight for Khabib, you are."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "So let me ask two questions."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match when you're at your peak?"}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Yeah, I don't like, yeah, I mean, it's one of those people where people will get really mad at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, I think."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "But how would you do it?"}, {"time": 6063, "text": "How would you solve that puzzle?"}, {"time": 6065, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we would grapple and I think I would be better than him."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "But you know, sometimes I feel weird saying this, people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And, but that's no one out grappled him, right?"}, {"time": 6078, "text": "I mean, nobody did."}, {"time": 6078, "text": "And maybe I'm wrong on this, but if we look at the best possible candidates, I'm definitely one of them."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "And then obviously I have a small size advantage too."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "So in a wrestling match, so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "What do you think is the right strategy on him?"}, {"time": 6095, "text": "Like, do you understand his style, his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?"}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?"}, {"time": 6104, "text": "Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately, fought any real, who I would say, really, really high level wrestlers."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "I was actually really disappointed how bad Justin Gaethje's wrestling was, because

just wrestling, not just the actual martial art of wrestling that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts, but other things like the way we're systemized."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "So most kids who have all this have went through the high school program and the college program and they know how to show up on time and they know how to work hard."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever, they know how to show up on time and they know how to work hard and that's gonna get you a really long way."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "Just those two things, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "Those things."}, {"time": 6664, "text": "Then I think you throw on top of that the fact that most of us have competed 1500 to 2000 times, probably by the time we get to 20 something, like that's a huge advantage too."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Most of these other people from other disciplines maybe have competed 100, if that, right?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So we have this competitive process down really, really, really, really well."}, {"time": 6683, "text": "Plus the weight cut."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "The weight cut."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "There's all these things that factor into it."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "I think the fact that we're really open minded, I think if you would, I don't wanna pick on jiu jitsu again, but how many jiu jitsu guys have became highly proficient in wrestling versus how many wrestling guys have became highly proficient in jiu jitsu?"}, {"time": 6699, "text": "I think that number swings one way and not that much the other way, you know?"}, {"time": 6704, "text": "So we're open to adapting and learning and for some reason, like jiu jitsu people, how many of them have got high level wrestling?"}, {"time": 6714, "text": "Or even mediocre wrestling, the number's really small."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "They refuse to, it's really frustrating."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "Why won't they do this?"}, {"time": 6721, "text": "This is obviously a part of it."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "I don't wanna pick on specific guys, but there's certain guys in the history of MMA where you're like, listen, man."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight, is a great example of somebody who actually did get proficient in wrestling, right?"}, {"time": 6735, "text": "But there's some of these jiu jitsu guys who's like, if you just got on top, you would submit him."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "Why can't you learn a freaking takedown?"}, {"time": 6740, "text": "Like, holy moly, just learn how to take someone down."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "Once you get them down, they will not get up and you win the fight."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "Like, it's so easy, you know?"}, {"time": 6748, "text": "But they refuse."}, {"time": 6749, "text": "How complicated is that journey?"}, {"time": 6750, "text": "So like Donaher that you mentioned, Craig Jones, they're big on wrestling as part of jiu jitsu now."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "Like wrestling, not just on the feet, but wrestling from the bottom coming up and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say, for a jiu jitsu person to learn?"}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Not that hard."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "If they really put their mind to it."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "Cause they already like, when you grapple, and this is any grappling art, like there's a certain part of it that you kind of get and it can, it might not be the exact same thing, but you understand how your body moves and how to feel certain pressures and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?"}, {"time": 6784, "text": "So I don't think, I think there's a certain level of stubbornness where they didn't want to, certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the I'm so macho, I can stand and bang thing, you know, where they want to show how macho they are."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they, there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient in jiu jitsu and really adapted and it doesn't go the other way."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "And then I guess the other thing there too is they can both steal from each other, right?"}, {"time": 6815, "text": "As any martial art can steal from another."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "And like, I feel like jiu jitsu didn't do enough stealing from wrestling."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possible and said, well, why don't we steal that and that and that?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "You know, and like, hey, let's take that over."}, {"time": 6828, "text": "And maybe we'd make a little tweak because it's different, but there's something we can definitely use there."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "So like in wrestling, for example, you know there's a one arm guillotine in jiu jitsu, right?"}, {"time": 6839, "text": "Okay, so there's a move called, well, it's got a hundred, I mean, it's like the oldest move in wrestling because it's what they did, the cows, where they go around the chin and they throw them on the back, how do we call that one?"}, {"time": 6848, "text": "Okay, sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?"}, {"time": 6852, "text": "Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck, throw it to the side?"}, {"time": 6855, "text": "No, but in wrestling, in wrestling."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "Okay, we call it that."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "Are you putting it under?"}, {"time": 6860, "text": "Yeah, so you can grab their chin and then you go under their arm and then throw them on their back."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "Yeah, so we call that the honey badger, but it's got different names, wherever you go, it's got different names."}, {"time": 6870, "text": "So I would always, I would say like pre Jiu Jitsu, I was average at it, like I could do it, but against good people, you'd never get it for, because they would get the back of their head up and they were too strong where you couldn't collapse them by going over their neck, right?"}, {"time": 6885, "text": "Because the forces weren't right."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "So then in Jiu Jitsu, you learn the one arm gi team where you grab their chin and this is more of running along the side of their head and then you go here and you choke them, right?"}, {"time": 6895, "text": "Much more efficient way to move their head because the fulcrum is way down here and their head can move into that, right?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "So once I learned that in Jiu Jitsu, I'm like, wait, I can do this in wrestling."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "So now once I learn how to grab their chin the right way and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "I just had to steal that Jiu Jitsu, put it in wrestling and boom, there we go."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "But very few people steal any direction, that takes creativity."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "And open mindedness."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "It's so easy because it's already done, you just gotta steal it."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "I mean, same with Judo, if you're a gi Jiu Jitsu person, there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing because Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves on the transition, which is something Jiu Jitsu does not do."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "Because you have some."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "You mean from the take down to."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "From the take down, but also just in general, just in the transition, the concept of transition, the Jiu Jitsu is very much about we're in this position, then we're in this position, then we're in this position."}, {"time": 6956, "text": "The Judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "That's when you need to strike."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "And to learn that, I mean, that's why people like Travis Stevens and Judoka, when they go to Jiu Jitsu, they can dominate."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "But Jiu Jitsu people should steal that."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "They're too stubborn."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too."}, {"time": 6977, "text": "No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers."}, {"time": 6981, "text": "Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches, John Smith, Dan Gabel, they don't really have interest in MMA or Jiu Jitsu and so on."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "But you would think somebody like a John Smith would like put on a white belt and roll around."}, {"time": 6996, "text": "Yeah, I think he's just too focused on, you know."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "Well, he's a coach."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "Well, he's a coach and what he's doing."}, {"time": 7001, "text": "Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger, he would have a lot of fun."}, {"time": 7006, "text": "We actually have a really good wrestler making his MMA debut tomorrow."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "I don't know if you, Bo Nickel, I'm sure you've heard of him, very high level."}, {"time": 7011, "text": "I think he's gonna have a lot of success."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "I mean, some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu makes you a little comfortable being in your back and for a wrestler, that could be like really bad."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "I hate that take."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "Yeah, but that's the Dan Gabel take."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "It's so stupid, it's so stupid."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "For God's sakes, we know the fucking rules."}, {"time": 7032, "text": "Just, in wrestling, you don't go to your back."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "In Jiu Jitsu, you can, it's like, whatever."}, {"time": 7037, "text":

would put myself in butterfly guard, and I wasn't going against good people, so which is why I was doing all these things."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling where you're butterfly guard."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "So I think that there's a few places where I use it."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "But so specifically the Elevator Series, which my

foot, boom, and I elevate you over, right?"}, {"time": 7133, "text": "And then also sometimes, I think Keegan does this too from watching me, but if I get double leg, sometimes if I'm accepting, so

my hip back to the mat, and end up in a wizard position."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "I've used that quite a few times, where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism that gets me back to maybe not a great

have half a million, and you're gonna feel really, really rich with that half a million dollars because you bought it for effing $2,500, you know?"}, {"time": 7442, "text": "So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them because it could change your life."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And if you hold it and it goes down, you're going to feel the pain of that."}, {"time": 7456, "text": "Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially, it's much more psychologically difficult to ride the ups and downs."}, {"time": 7462,

money."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "They bought it because they thought it was going up."}, {"time": 7509, "text": "And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it, right?"}, {"time": 7511, "text": "Whereas

{"time": 7552, "text": "Let's fucking figure it out now."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons we can learn from wrestling, whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic, or, you know what I said, wrestlers show up on time and they work hard, right?"}, {"time": 7563, "text": "These things, if we can learn these things at an early age, those are general, those characteristics will generally carry on throughout our life."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "And those are the things that are going to make us really successful."}, {"time": 7572,

want to live, doing a job you want to do, right?"}, {"time": 7600, "text": "There's so many possibilities and you just have to be bold enough to go take those chances."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "It's interesting because early on in life is when you have much more time."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "People don't realize it's time to learn the lessons."}, {"time": 7613, "text": "Like somehow later in life, you get busier, responsibilities and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "Like high school is a magical time."}, {"time": 7620, "text": "You're in college."}, {"time": 7621,

meetings fill the day."}, {"time": 7645, "text": "And then you have more projects and you do a great job and you become successful."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "And then the more meetings fill the day and more responsibilities as opposed to like, wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things?"}, {"time": 7658, "text": "And instead, do I want to find one or two things to really focus on?"}, {"time": 7663, "text": "And that's what I choose."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "But that becomes harder and harder and harder as you get older."}, {"time": 7670, "text": "No, I mean, I'm sure, and also the more success you have, you become sought after other places too."}, {"time": 7676, "text": "I'm sure that's happening with you."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "Saying no is hard."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "You're known for roasting people with a single boom roasted line."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "So any ideas, maybe you want

insane on Twitter, actually."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "He's quite a lot."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "So I had to unfollow him on Twitter, because he was too much."}, {"time": 7739, "text": "It was too intense?"}, {"time": 7740, "text": "No, it was too much, it fills up."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "Like, I want to be able to consume the content."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "So if I want to see
