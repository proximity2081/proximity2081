intelligence or are we just two Jews on a mic that appreciate that kind of humor?"}, {"time": 274, "text": "No, I think that it's absolutely connected to intelligence."}, {"time": 277, "text": "So you can, you can see it."}, {"time": 280, "text": "There's a place where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to lampoon Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan and he's going to outdo Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay."}, {"time": 289, "text": "And he has, forget the, well, let's see, he's doing Clementine as if Gilbert and Sullivan wrote it."}, {"time": 296, "text": "That I misunderstood depressed her young sister named Mr."}, {"time": 296, "text": "This Mr. Depester, she tried pestering sisters of festering blister you best to resist or say I, the sister persisted the Mr."}, {"time": 300, "text": "Resisted I kissed her all loyalty slip when he said, when she said I could have her, her sister's cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt."}, {"time": 310, "text": "That's so dense."}, {"time": 311, "text": "It's so insane that that's clearly intelligence because it's hard to construct something like that."}, {"time": 320, "text": "If I look at my favorite Tom Lehrer, Tom Lehrer lyric, you know, there's a perfectly absurd one, which is once all the Germans were warlike and mean, but that couldn't happen again."}, {"time": 330, "text": "We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then, right?"}, {"time": 334, "text": "That is a different kind of intelligence."}, {"time": 336, "text": "You know, you're taking something that is so horrific and you're, you're sort of making it palatable and funny and demonstrating also, um, just your humanity."}, {"time": 347, "text": "I mean, I think the thing that came through as, as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible, horrible lines was just what a sensitive and beautiful soul he was, who was channeling pain through humor and through grace."}, {"time": 362, "text": "I've seen throughout Europe, throughout Russia, that same kind of humor emerged from the generation of world war II."}, {"time": 369, "text": "It seemed like that humor is required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering of that, that war created."}, {"time": 376, "text": "You do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul."}, {"time": 379, "text": "I don't think that many Americans really appreciate, um, Russian humor, how you had to joke during the time of, let's say article 58 under Stalin, you had to be very, very careful."}, {"time": 395, "text": "You know, the concept of a Russian satirical magazine like Crocodile, uh, doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 401, "text": "So you have this cross cultural problem that there are certain areas of human experience that it would be better to know nothing about."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And quite unfortunately, Eastern Europe knows a great deal about them, which makes the, you know, the songs of Vladimir Vysotsky so potent, the, uh, you know, the pros of Pushkin, whatever it is, uh, you have to appreciate the depth of the Eastern European experience."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And I would think that perhaps Americans knew something like this around the time of the civil war or merit maybe, um, you know, under slavery and Jim Crow or even the, uh, harsh tyranny of, uh, the coal and steel employers during the labor wars."}, {"time": 448, "text": "Um, but in general, I would say it's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective culture unless we have the system of selective pressures that, for example, uh, Russians were subjected to."}, {"time": 461, "text": "Yeah, so if there's one good thing that comes out of war, it's literature, art, and humor and music."}, {"time": 470, "text": "Oh, I don't think so."}, {"time": 472, "text": "I think almost everything is good about war except for death and destruction."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Without the death, it would bring, uh, the romance of it."}, {"time": 482, "text": "The whole thing is nice."}, {"time": 483, "text": "Well, this is why we're always caught up in war and we have this very ambiguous relationship to it is that it makes life real and pressing and meaningful and at an unacceptable price and the price has never been higher."}, {"time": 497, "text": "So just jump in, uh, into AI a little bit."}, {"time": 502, "text": "You, uh, in one of the conversations you had or one of the videos, you described that one of the things AI systems can't do and biological systems can is self replicate in the physical world."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Oh no, no."}, {"time": 517, "text": "In the physical world."}, {"time": 518, "text": "Well, yes, the physical robots can't self replicate, but the fit, but you, this is a very tricky point, which is that the only thing that we've been able to create that's really complex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software."}, {"time": 537, "text": "But nevertheless, software replicates itself."}, {"time": 541, "text": "Uh, if we're speaking strictly for the replication in this kind of digital space."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So let me just to begin, let me ask a question."}, {"time": 548, "text": "Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world and the digital world?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "Let's not call it digital."}, {"time": 556, "text": "Let's call it the logical world versus the physical world."}, {"time": 560, "text": "Why logical?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "Well, because even though we had, let's say Einstein's brain preserved, uh, it was meaningless to us as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at a logical level."}, {"time": 575, "text": "And so the idea that something may be stored logically and that it may be stored physically, uh, are not necessarily, uh, we don't always benefit from synonymizing."}, {"time": 585, "text": "I'm not suggesting that there isn't a material basis to the logical world, but that it does warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic gates and zeros and ones."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And uh, so connecting those two worlds, the logical world and the physical world, or maybe just connecting to the logical world inside our brain, Einstein's brain."}, {"time": 609, "text": "You mentioned the idea of out, outtelligence."}, {"time": 614, "text": "Artificial outtelligence."}, {"time": 617, "text": "This is the only essay that John Brockman ever invited me to write that he refused to publish in Edge."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Well, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't well written, um, but I don't know."}, {"time": 630, "text": "The idea is quite compelling is quite unique and new and at least from my view of a stance point, maybe you can explain it."}, {"time": 639, "text": "What I was thinking about is why it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial general intelligence when in fact, artificial life, uh, is terrifying in and of itself and it's already here."}, {"time": 654, "text": "So in order to have a system of selective pressures, you need three distinct elements."}, {"time": 660, "text": "You need variation within a population."}, {"time": 664, "text": "You need heritability and you need differential success."}, {"time": 668, "text": "So what's really unique and I've made this point, I think elsewhere about software is that if you think about what humans know how to build, that's impressive."}, {"time": 679, "text": "So I always take a car and I say, does it have an analog of each of the physical physiological systems?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "Does it have a skeletal structure?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "That's its frame."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Does it have a neurological structure?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "Has an on board computer, has a digestive system."}, {"time": 695, "text": "The one thing it doesn't have is a reproductive system."}, {"time": 698, "text": "But if you can call spawn on a process, effectively you do have a reproductive system and that means that you can create something with variation, heritability and differential success."}, {"time": 713, "text": "Now the next step in the chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate, non intelligent life outwitting intelligent life?"}, {"time": 725, "text": "And um, I have two favorite systems and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted."}, {"time": 731, "text": "One of which is the Ofres orchid, um, subspecies or subclade."}, {"time": 736, "text": "I don't know what to call it."}, {"time": 737, "text": "There's a type of flower."}, {"time": 738, "text": "Yeah, it's a type of flower that mimics the female of a pollinator species in order to dupe the males into, uh, engaging."}, {"time": 747, "text": "It was called pseudo copulation with the fake female, which is usually represented by the lowest pedal."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And there's also a pheromone component to fool the males into thinking they have a mating opportunity."}, {"time": 758, "text": "But the flower doesn't have to give up energy energy in the form of nectar as a lure because it's tricking the males."}, {"time": 765, "text": "The other system is a particular species, uh, of muscle lampicillus in the clear streams of Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that contain its young."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And when the bass see this fleshy lip, which looks exactly like a species of fish that the bass like to eat, the, uh, the young explode and clamp onto the gills and parasitize the bass and also lose the best redistribute them as they eventually release both of these systems."}, {"time": 800, "text": "You have a highly intelligent dupe being fooled by a lower life form and what is sculpting these, these convincing lures."}, {"time": 814, "text": "It's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy, uh, those weaker mimics, uh, fall off."}, {"time": 829, "text": "They have terminal lines and only the better ones survive."}, {"time": 832, "text": "So it's an arms race between the target species, uh, that is being parasitized, getting smarter and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object getting as if smarter."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And so what you see is, is that artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence is not needed to parasitize us."}, {"time": 857, "text": "It's simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So you could have a program, let's say, you know, one of these Nigerian scams, um, that writes letters and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin, uh, to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away."}, {"time": 878, "text": "And you don't need it to be in any way intelligent in order to have a really nightmarish scenario of being parasitized by something that has no idea what it's doing."}, {"time": 886, "text": "So you, you, you phrased a few concepts really eloquently."}, {"time": 889, "text": "So let me try to, uh, as a few directions this goes."}, {"time": 893, "text": "So one first, first of all, in the way we write software today, it's not common that we allow it to self modify."}, {"time": 901, "text": "But we do have that ability."}, {"time": 902, "text": "Now we have the ability, it's just not common."}, {"time": 905, "text": "It's not just common."}, {"time": 906, "text": "So, so your, your thought is that that is a serious worry."}, {"time": 913, "text": "If there becomes, uh, Self modifying code is, is available now."}, {"time": 918, "text": "So there's, there's different types of self modification, right?"}, {"time": 921, "text": "There's a personalization, you know, your email app, your Gmail is a self modifying to you after you log in or whatever you can think of it that way."}, {"time": 932, "text": "But ultimately it's central, all the information is centralized, but you're thinking of ideas where you're completely, so this is an unique entity, uh, operating under selective pressures and it changes."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Uh, so that's a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 985, "text": "Well, terrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Whatever I suggest these things, I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will bring them into being by talking about them."}, {"time": 997, "text": "So, uh, there's this thing from open AI, uh, next, next week to talk to the founder of open AI, uh, this idea that, uh, their text generation, the new, uh, the new stuff they have for generating texts is they didn't want to bring it, they didn't want to release it because they're worried about the."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "I'm delighted to hear that, but they're going to end up releasing."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So that's the thing is I think talking about it, um, well, at least from my end, I'm more a proponent of technology preventing tech, uh, so further innovation, preventing the detrimental effects of innovation."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Well, we're at a, we're sort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So whether or not we're proponents or it doesn't, it doesn't really, it may not matter, but I, well, I do feel that there are people who've held things back and, uh, you know, died poor than they might've otherwise been."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "We don't even know their names."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I don't think that we should discount the idea that having the smartest people showing off how smart they are by what they've developed may be a terminal process."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I do think that not enough of us feel in our gut what it is we are playing with when we are working on technical problems."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called the bridge over the bridge on the river Kwai about, I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire to do a bridge well, end up over collaborating with their Japanese captors."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "Well now you're making me a question the unrestricted open discussion of ideas and AI."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I could make a decent case for either our need to talk about this and to become technologically focused on containing it or need to stop talking about this and try to hope that the relatively small number of highly adept individuals who are looking at these problems is small enough that we should in fact be talking about how to contain them."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Well the way ideas, the way innovation happens, what new ideas develop, Newton with calculus, whether if he was silent, the idea would be, would emerge elsewhere in the case of Newton of course."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "But in the case of AI, how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would arise?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Well the idea is that the researchers we know and those that we don't know who may live in countries that don't wish us to know what level they're currently at are very disciplined in keeping these things to themselves."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Of course I will point out that there's a religious school in Kerala that developed something very close to the calculus, certainly in terms of infinite series in I guess religious prayer and rhyme and prose."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "So it's not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don't really believe that we have an ability to hold it back."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects of what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able to contain things later."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "So on the idea of intelligence, what form, treading cautiously as we've agreed as we tumbled down the hill, what form... We can't stop ourselves, can we?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "We cannot."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "What form do you see it taking?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "So one example, Facebook, Google, do want to, I don't know a better word, you want to influence users to behave a certain way and so that's one kind of example of how intelligence is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kinds."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "But do you see other examples of this actually emerging in... Just take any parasitic system, make sure that there's some way in which that there's differential success, heritability, and variation."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "And those are the magic ingredients and if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine, make sure that the system that expresses the variability has a spanning set so that it can learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "That's your nightmare."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So it's your nightmare, but it could also be, it's a really powerful mechanism by which to create, well, powerful systems."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So are you more worried about the negative direction that might go versus the positive?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So you said parasitic, but that doesn't necessarily need to be what the system converges towards."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "It could be, what is it?"}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And the dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "That's what they tell me about marriage."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "I'm still single, so I don't know."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Well yeah, we could go into that too, but no, I think we have to appreciate, are you infected by your own mitochondria?"}, {"time": 1381, "text": "That's a very tricky situation to analyze and I would say that predators and parasites drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Well ultimately, I mean nobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is, but there is some metrics."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "They didn't tell you?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "That's why all the poetry and books are about, you know, there's some metrics under which you can kind of measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "So you're more nervous about software than you are optimistic about ideas of, yeah, self replicating largely."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "I don't think we've really felt where we are."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "You know, occasionally we get a wake up, 9 11 was so anomalous compared to everything else we've experienced on American soil that it came to us as a complete shock that that was even a possibility."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "What it really was was a highly creative and determined R and D team deep in the bowels of Afghanistan showing us that we had certain exploits that we were open to that nobody had chosen to express."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "I can think of several of these things that I don't talk about publicly that just seem to have to do with, um, how relatively unimaginative those who wish to cause havoc and destruction have been up until now."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "But the great mystery of our time of this particular little era is how remarkably stable we've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to use a nuclear weapons in anger."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "We've had several close calls, we've had mistakes, we've had a brinksmanship."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And what's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that, Oh, it's, it'll always be nothing."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "It's been so long since something was at that level of danger that we've got a wrong idea in our head."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And that's why when I went on the Ben Shapiro show, I talked about the need to resume above ground testing of nuclear devices because we have people whose developmental experience suggests that when let's say Donald Trump and North Korea engage on Twitter, Oh, it's nothing."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "It's just posturing."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Everybody's just in it for money."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "There's, there's an, a sense that people are in a video game mode, which has been the right call since 1945."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "We've been mostly in video game mode."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So you're worried about a generation which has not seen any existential."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "We've lived under it."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "You see, you're younger."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "I don't know if, if, and again, you came from, from Moscow."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "There was a TV show called the day after that had a huge effect on a generation growing up in the U S and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "We have not gone through an embodied experience collectively where we've thought about this."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "And I think it's one of the most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done, which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are cut off of the, of the Rose bushes and all of the edges are rounded and sanded."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "And so people have developed this, this totally unreal idea, which is everything's going to be just fine."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And do I think that my leading concern is AGI or my leading concern is a thermonuclear exchange or gene drives or any one of these things?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "I don't know, but I know that our time here in this very long experiment here is finite because the toys that we've built are so impressive and the wisdom to accompany them has not materialized."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And I think it's, we actually got a wisdom uptick since 1945."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "We had a lot of dangerous skilled players on the world stage who nevertheless, no matter how bad they were managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from the cold war."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "Yeah, and the distance from the cold war, you know, I'm very mindful of a, there was a Russian tradition actually of on your wedding day, going to visit a memorial to those who gave their lives."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "Can you imagine this where you, on the happiest day of your life, you go and you pay homage to the people who fought and died in the battle of Stalingrad."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "I'm not a huge fan of communism, I got to say, but there were a couple of things that the Russians did that were really positive in the Soviet era."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "And I think trying to let people know how serious life actually is, is the Russian model of seriousness is better than the American model."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And maybe like you mentioned, there was a small echo of that after 9 11."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "But we wouldn't let it form."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "We talk about 9 11, but it's 9 12 that really moved the needle when we were all just there and nobody wanted to speak."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "We witnessed something super serious and we didn't want to run to our computers and blast out our deep thoughts and our feelings."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And it was profound because we woke up briefly, you know, I talk about the gated institutional narrative that sort of programs our lives."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "I've seen it break three times in my life, one of which was the election of Donald Trump."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Another time was the fall of Lehman Brothers when everybody who knew that Bear Stearns wasn't that important knew that Lehman Brothers met AIG was next."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And the other one was 9 11."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And so if I'm 53 years old and I only remember three times that the global narrative was really interrupted, that tells you how much we've been on top of developing events."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "You know, I mean we had the Murrow federal building explosion, but it didn't cause the narrative to break."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "It wasn't profound enough."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Around 9 12 we started to wake up out of our slumber and the powers that be did not want to coming together."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "They, you know, the admonition was go shopping."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And the powers that be was what is that force as opposed to blaming individuals?"}, {"time": 1808, "text": "So whatever that, whatever that force is, there's a component of it that's emergent and there's a component of it that's deliberate."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So give yourself a portfolio with two components."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "Some amount of it is emergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding that if people come together, they become an incredible force."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "And what you're seeing right now I think is there are forces that are trying to come together and there are forces that are trying to push things apart."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "And you know, one of them is the globalist narrative versus the national narrative where to the global, uh, globalist perspective, uh, the nation nations are bad things in essence that they're temporary, they're nationalistic, they're jingoistic, it's all negative to people in the national, more in the national idiom, they're saying, look, this is where I pay my taxes."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "This is where I do my army service."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "This is where I have a vote."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "This is where I have a passport."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "Who the hell are you to tell me that because you've moved into someplace that you can make money globally, that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a special and elevated duty."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And I think that these competing narratives have been pushing towards the global perspective, uh, from the elite and a larger and larger number of disenfranchised people are saying, hey, I actually live in a, in a place and I have laws and I speak a language, I have a culture."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "And who are you to tell me that because you can profit in some far away land that my obligations to my fellow countrymen are so, so much diminished."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So these tensions between nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud of your country and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "They, they ultimately, it is human nature and it is good for us for wake up calls of different kinds."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Well, I think that these are tensions and my point isn't, I mean, nationalism run amok is a nightmare and internationalism run amok is a nightmare."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "And the problem is we're trying to push these pendulums, uh, to some place where they're somewhat balanced, where we, we have a higher duty of care to those, uh, who share our log, our laws and our citizenship, but we don't forget our duties of care to the global system."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we're facing concerns the ability for some to profit at the, by abandoning their obligations, uh, to others within their system."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "And that's what we've had for
