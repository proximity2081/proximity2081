[{"title": "Grant Sanderson: Math, Manim, Neural Networks & Teaching with 3Blue1Brown | Lex Fridman Podcast #118", "id": "U_6AYX42gkU", "quotes": [{"time": 331, "text": "It's a little bit cliche to say that you like Feynman, right?"}, {"time": 334, "text": "That's almost like when you don't know what to say about sports and you just point to the Super Bowl or something or something you enjoy watching."}, {"time": 341, "text": "But I do actually think there's a layer to Feynman that sits behind the iconography."}, {"time": 345, "text": "One thing that just really struck me was this letter that he wrote to his wife two years after she died."}, {"time": 351, "text": "So during the Manhattan Project, she had polio."}, {"time": 354, "text": "Tragically she died."}, {"time": 355, "text": "They were just young, madly in love."}, {"time": 358, "text": "And the icon of Feynman is almost this mildly sexist, womanizing philanderer, at least on the personal side."}, {"time": 368, "text": "But you read this letter, and I can try to pull it up for you if I want."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And it's just this absolutely heartfelt letter to his wife saying how much he loves her even though she's dead and what she means to him, how no woman can ever measure up to her."}, {"time": 381, "text": "And it shows you that the Feynman that we've all seen in Surely You're Joking is different from the Feynman in reality."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And I think the same kind of goes in his science, where he sometimes has this output of being this aw shucks character, like everyone else is coming in with these fancyfalutin formulas, but I'm just going to try to whittle it down to its essentials, which is so appealing because we love to see that kind of thing."}, {"time": 405, "text": "But when you get into it, what he was doing was actually quite deep, very much mathematical."}, {"time": 412, "text": "That should go without saying, but I remember reading a book about Feynman in a cafe once, and this woman looked at me and saw that it was about Feynman."}, {"time": 418, "text": "She was like, oh, I love him."}, {"time": 419, "text": "I read Surely You're Joking."}, {"time": 421, "text": "And she started explaining to me how he was never really a math person."}, {"time": 424, "text": "And I don't understand how that can possibly be a public perception about any physicist, but for whatever reason, that worked into his art that he shooed off math in place of true science."}, {"time": 435, "text": "The reality of it is he was deeply in love with math and was much more going in that direction and had a clicking point into seeing that physics was a way to realize that and all the creativity that he could output in that direction was instead poured towards things like fundamental, not even fundamental theories, just emergent phenomena and everything like that."}, {"time": 452, "text": "So to answer your actual question, like what, what, what I like about, uh, his way of going at things is this constant desire to reinvent it for himself."}, {"time": 462, "text": "Like when he would consume papers, the way he'd describe it, he's, he would start to see what problem he was trying to solve and then just try to solve it himself to get a sense of personal ownership."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And then from there, see what others had done."}, {"time": 472, "text": "Is that how you see problems yourself?"}, {"time": 474, "text": "Like that's actually an interesting point when you first are inspired by a certain idea that you maybe want to teach or visualize or just explore on your own."}, {"time": 485, "text": "I'm sure you're captured by some possibility and magic of it."}, {"time": 488, "text": "Do you read the work of others?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "Like do you go through the proofs or do you try to rediscover everything yourself?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "So I think the things that I've learned best and have the deepest ownership of are the ones that have some element of rediscovery."}, {"time": 501, "text": "The problem is that really slows you down."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And this is for my, for my part, it's actually a big fault."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Like this is part of why I'm, I'm not an active researcher."}, {"time": 508, "text": "I'm not like at the depth of the field."}, {"time": 509, "text": "A lot of other people are the stuff that I do learn."}, {"time": 512, "text": "I try to learn it really well."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Um, but other times you do need to get through it at a certain pace."}, {"time": 517, "text": "You do need to get to a point of a problem you're trying to solve."}, {"time": 519, "text": "So obviously you need to be well equipped to read things, uh, without that reinvention component and see how others have done it."}, {"time": 525, "text": "But I think if you choose a few core building blocks along the way and you say, I'm really going to try to approach this, um, before I see how this person went at it, I'm really going to try to approach it for myself."}, {"time": 536, "text": "No matter what you gain, all sorts of inarticulatable intuitions about that topic, which aren't going to be there."}, {"time": 543, "text": "If you simply go through the proof, for example, you're going to be, um, trying to come up with counter examples."}, {"time": 547, "text": "You're going to try to come up with, um, intuitive examples, all sorts of things where you're populating your brain with data."}, {"time": 553, "text": "And the ones that you come up with are likely to be different than the one that the text comes up with and that like lends at a different angle."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So that aspect also slowed Feynman down in a lot of respects."}, {"time": 562, "text": "I think there was a period when like the rest of physics was running away from him."}, {"time": 566, "text": "Um, but in so far as got, it got him to where he was, uh, I, I kind of resonate with that."}, {"time": 572, "text": "I just, I would, I would be nowhere near it cause I not like him at all, but it's like a, uh, state to aspire to."}, {"time": 581, "text": "You know, just to link in a small point you made that you're not a quote unquote active researcher, do you, you're swimming often in reasonably good depth about a lot of topics."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Do you sometimes want to like dive deep at a certain moment and say, like, cause you probably built up a hell of an amazing intuition about what is and isn't true within these worlds."}, {"time": 608, "text": "Do you ever want to just dive in and see if you can discover something new?"}, {"time": 615, "text": "I, I think one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not having built better relationships with the professors I had there."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And I think a big part of success and research is that element of like mentorship and like people giving you the kind of scaffolded problems to carry along for my own like goals right now."}, {"time": 631, "text": "I feel like, um, I'm pretty good at exposing math to others and like want to continue doing that for my personal learning."}, {"time": 639, "text": "I, are you familiar with like the hedgehog Fox dynamic?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "I think this was, um, either the ancient Greeks came up with it or it was pretended to be something drawn from the ancient Greeks that I don't know who to point it to, but the probably Mark Twain."}, {"time": 654, "text": "It is that you've got two types of people or especially two types of researchers."}, {"time": 659, "text": "There's the Fox that knows many different things and then the hedgehog that knows one thing very deeply."}, {"time": 664, "text": "So like von Neumann would have been the Fox."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Obviously someone who knows many different things, just very foundational, a lot of different fields."}, {"time": 671, "text": "Um, Einstein would have been more of a hedge thinking really deeply about one particular thing and both are very necessary for making progress."}, {"time": 677, "text": "Um, so between those two, I would definitely see myself as like the Fox where, uh, I'll try to get my pause in like a whole bunch of different things."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And at the moment I just think I don't know enough of anything to make like a significant contribution to any of them."}, {"time": 690, "text": "But I do see value in, um, like having a decently deep understanding of a wide variety of things."}, {"time": 696, "text": "Like most people who, uh, know computer science really deeply don't necessarily know physics very deeply or, uh, many of the aspects, like different fields in math, even let's say you have like an analytic number theory versus an algebraic number theory."}, {"time": 709, "text": "Like these two things end up being related to very different fields."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Like some of them more complex analysis, some of them more like algebraic geometry."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And then when you just go out so far as to take those adjacent fields, place one, you know, PhD student into a seminar of another ones, they don't understand what the other one's saying at all."}, {"time": 724, "text": "Like you take the complex analysis specialist inside the algebraic geometry seminar, they're as lost as you or I would be."}, {"time": 730, "text": "But I think, uh, going around and like trying to have some sense of what this big picture is certainly has personal value for me."}, {"time": 736, "text": "I don't know if I would ever make like new contributions in those fields, but I do think I could make new like expositional contributions where there's kind of a notion of, uh, things that are known, but like haven't been explained very well."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Well, first of all, I think most people would agree your videos, your teaching the way you see the world is fundamentally often new, like you're creating something new and it almost feels like research, even just like the visualizations, uh, the multidimensional visualization we'll talk about."}, {"time": 768, "text": "I mean, you're revealing something very interesting that, uh, yeah, just feels like research feels like science feels like the cutting edge of the very thing of which like new ideas and new discoveries are made of."}, {"time": 783, "text": "I do think you're being a little bit more generous than is necessarily."}, {"time": 786, "text": "And I promise that's not even false humility because I sometimes think when I research a video, I'll learn like 10 times as much as I need for the video itself and it ends up feeling kind of elementary."}, {"time": 795, "text": "Um, so I have a sense of just how far away like the stuff that I cover is from the actual depth."}, {"time": 802, "text": "I think that's natural, but I think that could also be a mathematics thing."}, {"time": 806, "text": "I feel like in the machine learning world, you like two weeks in, you feel like you've basically mastered in mathematics."}, {"time": 814, "text": "It's like, well, everything is either trivial or impossible."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And it's like a shockingly thin line between the two where you can find something that's totally impenetrable."}, {"time": 822, "text": "And then after you get a feel for it, it's like, Oh yeah, that whole, that whole subject is actually trivial in some way."}, {"time": 828, "text": "So maybe that's what goes on."}, {"time": 830, "text": "Every researcher is just on the other end of that hump and it feels like it's so far away, but one step actually gets them there."}, {"time": 836, "text": "What do you think about, uh, sort of Feynman's teaching style or another perspective of use of visualization?"}, {"time": 845, "text": "Well his teaching style is interesting because people have described like the Feynman effect where while you're watching his lectures or while he reading his lectures, everything makes such perfect sense."}, {"time": 855, "text": "So as an entertainment session, it's wonderful because it gives you this, um, this intellectual satisfaction that you don't get from anywhere else that you like finally understand it."}, {"time": 866, "text": "But the Feynman effect is that you can't really recall what it is that gave you that insight, you know, even a week later."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And this is, um, this is true of a lot of books and a lot of lectures where the retention is never quite what we hope it is."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Unless you're doing something like that, it's not actually going to stick."}, {"time": 907, "text": "So the very same thing that's so admirable about Feynman's lectures, which is how damn satisfying they are to consume might actually also reveal a little bit of the flaw that we should as educators all look out for, which is that that does not correlate with long term learning."}, {"time": 923, "text": "We'll talk about it a little bit."}, {"time": 925, "text": "I think you've done some interactive stuff."}, {"time": 928, "text": "I mean, even in your videos, the awesome thing that Feynman couldn't do at the time is you could, since it's programmed, you can like tinker, like play with stuff."}, {"time": 940, "text": "You could take this value and change it."}, {"time": 942, "text": "You can like heroes, take the value of this variable and change it to build up an intuition, to move along the surface or to, to change the shape of something."}, {"time": 951, "text": "I think that's almost an equivalent of you doing it yourself."}, {"time": 957, "text": "It's not quite there, but you as a viewer, um, yeah, do you think there's some value in that interactive element?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "Yeah, well, so what's interesting is you're saying that, and the videos are non interactive in the sense that there's a play button and a pause button."}, {"time": 970, "text": "Um, and you could ask like, Hey, while you're programming these things, why don't you program it into an interactable version?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "You know, make it a Jupiter notebook that people can play with, which I should do."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And that like would be better."}, {"time": 980, "text": "I think the thing about interactives though is most people consuming them, um, just sort of consume what the author had in mind."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Uh, and that's kind of what they want."}, {"time": 989, "text": "Like I have a ton of friends who make interactive explanations."}, {"time": 993, "text": "And when you look into the analytics of how people use them, there's a small sliver that genuinely use it as a playground to have experiments."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And maybe that small sliver is actually who you're targeting and the rest don't matter."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Um, but most people consume it just as a piece of, um, like well constructed literature that maybe you tweak with the example a little bit to see what it's getting at."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "But in that way, I do think like a video can get most of the benefits of the interactive, like the interactive app, as long as you make the interactive for yourself and you decide what the best narrative to spin is."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Um, as a more concrete example, like my process with, I made this video about, um, SIR models for epidemics and it's like this agent based bottling thing where you tweak some things about how the epidemic spreads and you want to see how that affects its evolution."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "Um, my, my, uh, format for making that was very different than others where rather than scripting it ahead of time, I just made the playground and then I played a bunch, uh, and then I saw what stories there were to tell within that."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Um, that's cool."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So your, your video had that kind of structure, it had, uh, like five or six stories or whatever it was."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And like, it was basically, okay, here's a simulation, here's a model."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "What can we discover with this model?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "And here's five things I found after playing with it."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Well, cause here, the thing is a way that you could do that project is you make the model and then you put it out and you say, here's a thing for the world to play with, like come to my website where you interact with this thing."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Um, and, and people did like sort of remake it in a, um, JavaScript way so that you can go to that website and you can test your own hypotheses."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But I think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technology, but to give the story around it as well."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And like, that's kind of my job."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "It's not just to like make the, uh, the visuals that someone will look at it's to be the one to decide what's the interesting thing to walk through here."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Um, and even though there's lots of other interesting paths that one could take, that can be kind of daunting when you're just sitting there in a sandbox and you're given this tool with like five different sliders and you're told to like play and discover things."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Where do you do?"}, {"time": 1113, "text": "What do you start?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "What are my hypotheses?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "What should I be asking?"}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Like a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparks curiosity to make someone want to, um, imagine more about it."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "A few videos I've seen you do, I don't know how often you do it, but there's almost a tangential like pause where you, here's a cool thing you say like, here's a cool thing, but it's outside the scope of this video essentially, but I'll leave it to you as homework essentially to like figure out it's a cool thing to explore."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I wish I could say that wasn't a function of laziness and that's like, you've worked so hard on making the 20 minutes already that to extend it out even further, it would take more time."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And one of your cooler videos, the homomorphic, like from the Mobius strip to this, yeah, that's the super and you're like, yeah, you can't, uh, you can't transform the Mobius strip into a, into a surface without it intersecting itself, but I'll leave it to you to see why that is."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Well, I hope that's not exactly how I phrase it because I think what my hope would be is that I leave it to you to think about why you would expect that to be true and then to want to know what aspects of a Mobius strip do you want to formalize such that you can prove that intuition that you have because at some point now you're starting to invent algebraic topology."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "If you have these vague instincts like I want to get this Mobius strip, I want to, um, fit it such that it's all above the plane, but it's boundary sits exactly on the plane."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "I don't think I can do that without crossing itself, but that feels really vague."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "How do I formalize it?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And as you're starting to formalize that, that's what's going to get you to try to come up with a definition for what it means to be orientable or non orientable."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And like once you have that motivation, a lot of the otherwise arbitrary things that are sitting at the very beginning of a topology stack textbook start to make a little more sense."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And I mean that, that whole video beautifully was a motivation for topology school."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "That was my, well, my hope with that is I feel like topology is, um, I don't want to say it's taught wrong, but I do think sometimes it's popularized in the wrong way where, uh, you know, you'll hear these things that people saying, Oh, topologists, they're very interested in surfaces that you can bend and stretch, but you can't cut or glue."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "There's all sorts of things you can be interested in with random, like imaginative manipulations of things."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "Is that really what like mathematicians are into?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And the short answer is not, not really."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "That's uh, it's not as if someone was sitting there thinking like, I wonder what the properties of clay are by add some arbitrary rules about what, when I can't cut it and when I can't glue it instead, it's, there's a ton of pieces of math that, um, can actually be equivalent to, uh, like these very general structures that's like geometry, except you don't have exact distances."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "You just want to maintain a notion of closeness."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And once you get it to those general structures, constructing mappings between them translate into non trivial facts about other parts of math and that I just, I don't think that's actually like popularized."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "Um, I don't even think it's emphasized well enough when you're starting to take a topology class because you kind of have these two problems."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "It's like either it's too squishy."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "You're just talking about coffee mugs and donuts, or it's a little bit too rigor first."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "And you're talking about, um, the axiom systems with open sets and an open set is not the opposite of closed set."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So sorry about that."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "Everyone, we have a notion of clopin sets for ones that are both at the same time."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "It's just, it's not, it's not an intuitive axiom system in comparison to other fields of math."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So you as the student like really have to walk through mud to get there and you're constantly confused about how this relates to the beautiful things about coffee mugs and Mobius strips and such."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "And it takes a really long time to actually see like see topology in the way that mathematicians see topology."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "But I don't think it needs to take that time."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "I think there's, um, this is making me feel like I need to make more videos on the topic because I think you do, but you know, I've also seen it in my narrow view."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Uh, like, um, I find game theory very beautiful and I know topology has been used, uh, elegantly to prove things in game theory."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "You have like facts that seem very strange."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "Like I could tell you, you stir your coffee and um, after you stir it and like, let's say all the molecules settled to like not moving again, one of the molecules will be basically in the same position it was before."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Um, you have all sorts of fixed point theorems like this, right?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "That kind of fixed point theorem directly relevant to Nash equilibriums, right?"}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Um, so you can imagine popularizing it by describing the coffee fact, but then you're left to wonder like who cares about if a molecule of coffee like stays in the same spot?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Is this what we're paying our mathematicians for?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "Um, you have this very elegant mapping onto economics in a way that's very concrete or very, I shouldn't say concrete, very, uh, tangible, like actually adds value to people's lives through the predictions that it makes."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Uh, but that line isn't always drawn because like you have to get a little bit technical in order to properly draw that line out, um, and often I think popularized forms of media just shy away from being a little too technical for sure."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Uh, by the way, for people who are watching the video, I do not condone the message in this mug."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "It's the only one I have, which is this."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "The snuggle is real."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "By the way, for anyone watching, I do condone the message of that mug."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "Okay, so you mentioned the SIR model."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I think, uh, there are certain ideas there of growth of exponential growth."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "What maybe have you learned about, um, pandemics from, from making that video?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "Because it was kind of exploratory."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "You were kind of building up an intuition and it's, again, people should watch the video."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "It's kind of an abstract view."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "It's not really modeling in detail."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "The whole field of epidemiology, those, those people, they go really far in terms of modeling, like how people move about."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "I don't know if you've seen it, but like there is the mobility patterns, like how, like the track, like how many people you encounter in a certain situations when you go to a school, when you go to a mall, they like model every aspect of that for a particular city."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "Like they have maps of actual city streets."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "They model it really well and natural patterns of the people have it's crazy."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "So you don't do any of that."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "You're just doing an abstract model to explore different ideas of simple pedigree."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "Well, because I don't want to pretend like an epidemiologist, I'm an epidemiologist."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Like we have a ton of armchair epidemiologists and the spirit of that was more like, uh, can we through a little bit of play, uh, draw like reasonable ish conclusions."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "Um, and also just like, uh, get ourselves in a position where we can judge the validity of a model."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Like, I think people should look at that and they should criticize it."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "They should point to all the ways that it's wrong because it's definitely naive, right?"}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And the way that it's set up."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "Um, but to say like what, what lessons from that hold, like thinking about the are not value and what that represents and what it can imply."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Um, so are not is if you are infectious and you're in a population which is completely susceptible, uh, what's the average number of people that you're going to infect during your infectiousness?"}, {"time": 1546, "text": "Um, so certainly during the beginning of an epidemic, this basically gives you kind of the, um, the exponential growth rate."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Like if every person infects two others, you've got that one, two, four, eight, uh, exponential growth pattern."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "Um, as it goes on and, uh, let's say it's something, um, uh, endemic where you've got like a ton of people who have had it, uh, and are recovered, then, uh, you, you would, the are not value doesn't tell you that as directly because a lot of the people you interact with aren't susceptible, but in the early phases it does."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "Um, and this is like the fundamental constant that it seems like epidemiologists look at and you know, the whole goal is to get that down."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "If you can get it below one, then it's no longer

giving some intuitions on how do certain changes in behavior change that value and then what does that imply for exponential growth?"}, {"time": 1601, "text": "I think those are, um, general enough lessons and they're like resilient to all of the chaoses of the world, um, that it's still like valid to take from the video."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "I mean, one of the interesting aspects of that is just exponential growth and we think about growth."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "Is that the one of the first times you've done a video on, on, uh, no, of course not the whole, uh, well there's identity."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "I guess I've done a lot of videos about exponential growth in the circular direction, uh, only minimal in the normal direction."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "I mean, another way to ask, like, do you think we're able to reason intuitively about exponential growth?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "It's, it's funny."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "I think it's, um, I think it's extremely intuitive to humans and then we train it out of ourselves such that it's then really not intuitive and then I think it can become intuitive again when you study a technical field."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "That's the number that sits right between one and nine."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "Um, but sometimes when a numeracy and, uh, the kind of just basic arithmetic that we have isn't in a society, the natural instinct is three because it's, uh, in between in an exponential sense and a geometric sense that, uh, one is three times bigger and then the next one is three times bigger than that."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So it's like, what's, you know, if you have one friend versus a hundred friends, what's in between that?"}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Ten friends seems like the social status in between those two states."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So that's like deeply intuitive to us to think logarithmically like that."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Um, and for some reason we kind of train it out of ourselves to start thinking linearly about things."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "So in the sense, yeah, the early, early basic math is, uh, yeah, forces us to take a step back."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "It's, it's the same criticism if there's any of science is the lessons of science make us like see the world in a slightly narrow sense to where we, we have an over exaggerated confidence that we understand everything as opposed to just understanding a small slice of it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "But I think that probably only really goes for small numbers cause the real counterintuitive thing about exponential growth is like as the numbers start to get big."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "So I bet if you took that same setup and you asked them, oh, if I keep tripling the size of this rock pile, you know, um, seven times, how big will it be?"}, {"time": 1758, "text": "I bet it would be surprisingly big even to like an a society without numeracy."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And that's the side of it that, um, I think is pretty counterintuitive to us, uh, but that you can basically train into people like I think computer scientists and physicists when they're looking at the early numbers of, um, like COVID were, they were the ones thinking like, oh God, this is following an exact exponential curve."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Um, and I heard that from a number of people, uh, so it's, and, and almost all of them are like techies in some capacity, probably just cause I like live in the Bay area, but, but for sure they, they're cognizant of this kind of, this kind of growth is present in a lot of natural systems and a lot of, in a lot of, in a lot of systems."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Uh, I don't know if you've seen like, I mean, there's a lot of ways to visualize this obviously, but Raker as well, I think was the one that had this like chess board where, um, every, every square on the chess board, you double the number of stones or something in that chess board."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "I've heard, this is like an old proverb where it's like, you know, someone, the King offered him a gift and he said, ah, the only

know, the other classic example for, um, gauging someone's intuitive understanding of exponential growth is, uh, I've got like a Lily pad on a, on like really big lake, um, like lake Michigan and that

entire lake."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "So after how many days does it cover half the lake?"}, {"time": 1885, "text": "49."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So you, you have a good instinct for exponential growth."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So I think a lot of, uh, like the knee jerk reaction is sometimes to think that it's like half the amount of time or to at least be like surprised that like after 49 days, you've only covered half of it."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "I mean, that's the reason you heard a pause for me."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Um, I literally thought that can't be right."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So even when you know the fact and you do the division, it's like, wow."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So you've gotten like that whole time and then day 49, it's only covering half."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "And then after that it gets the whole thing."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "But I think you can make that even more visceral if rather than going one day before you say how long until, um, it's covered 1% of the lake, right."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "And it's, uh, so what would that be?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Um, how many times you have to double to get over a hundred, like seven, six and a half times, something like that."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "So at that point you're looking at 43, 44 days into it."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "You're not even at 1% of the lake."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So you've, you've experienced, you know, 44 out of 50 days and you're like, ah, that's really bad."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "It's just 1% of the lake."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "But then next thing you know, it's the entire lake."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "You're wearing a space X shirt."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So let me ask you, let me ask you one, one person who talks about exponential, you know, just the miracle of the exponential function in general is Elon Musk."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "So he kind of advocates the idea of exponential thinking, you know, realizing that technological development can, at least in the short term, follow exponential improvement, which breaks apart our intuition, our ability to reason about what is and isn't impossible."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So he's a big one."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "It's a good leadership kind of style of saying like, look, the thing that everyone thinks is impossible is actually possible because exponentials."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "But what's your sense about, um, about that kind of way to see the world?"}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Well, so I think it's, um, it can be very inspiring to note when something like Moore's law is another great example where you have this exponential pattern that holds shockingly well."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Um, and it enables, um, just better lives to be led."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "I think the people who took Moore's law seriously in the sixties, we're seeing that, wow, it's not going to be too long before like these giant

they took it seriously, like you have people predicting smartphones like a long time ago."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "Um, and it's only out of like kind of this, I don't want to say faith in exponentials, but an understanding that that's what's happening."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "What's more interesting I think is to, um, really understand why exponential growth happens and that the mechanism behind it is when the rate of change is proportional to the thing in and of itself."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So the reason that technology would grow exponentially is only going to be if, um, the rate of progress is proportional to the amount that you have."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So that the software you write enables you to write more software."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "Um, and I think we see this with the internet, like the advent of the internet makes it faster to learn things, which makes it faster to, uh, create new things."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "Um, I think this is, uh, oftentimes why like investment will grow exponentially that the more resources a company has, if it knows how to use them, well, the more, uh, the more it can actually grow."}, {"time": 2081,

part of that is because you have the sense, what you want is to make sure that the things that you develop, you have ownership of in the, they enable further development of the adjacent parts, right?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So it's not just this, you, you see a curve and you're blindly drawing a line through it."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "What's much more interesting is to ask, when do you have this proportional growth property?"}, {"time": 2104, "text": "Um, because then you can also recognize when it breaks down, like in an epidemic, as you approach saturation, that would break down."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "Um, as you do anything that, uh, skews what that proportionality constant is, um, you can make it maybe not break down as being an exponential, but it can seriously slow what that exponential rate is."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "This is the opposite of a pandemic is you want, in terms of ideas, you want to minimize barriers that, um, prevent the spread."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "You want to maximize the spread of impact."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "So like you want it to, to grow when you're doing technological development is so that you do hold up that rate holds up."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And that's, that's almost like, uh, like an operational challenge of like how you run a company, how you run a group of people is that any one invention has a ripple that's unstopped."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "And that ripple effect then has its own ripple effects and so on."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "And that continues."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "Like Moore's law is fascinating."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And the, like on a psychological level and a human level, cause it's not exponential."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "It's, it's just a consistent set of like what you would call like S curves, which is like, it's constantly like breakthrough innovations nonstop."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Like it might not actually be an example of exponentials because of something which grows in proportion to itself."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "But instead it's almost like a benchmark that was set out that everyone's been pressured to meet."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And it's like all these innovations and micro inventions along the way, rather than some consistent sit back and just let the lily pad grow across the lake phenomenon."}, {"time": 2198,

know, Moore's law, it's a law."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "So like it's a, it's certainly an achievable thing."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "You know, we achieved it for the last decade, for the last two decades, for the last three decades, you just keep going and it somehow makes it happen."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "It's like rippling the idea that it's possible and that idea that it's possible

out content is too slow to be actively helpful."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "Let me just do some biweekly lectures that if you're looking for a place to point your students, if you're a student looking for a place to be edified about math, just tune in at these times."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "Um, and in that sense, I think it was, you know, a success for those who followed with it."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "It was a really rewarding experience for me to see how people engaged with it."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Um, part of the fun of the live interaction was to actually like I do these live quizzes and see how people would answer and try to shape the lesson based on that or see what questions people were asking in the audience."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "I would love to, if I did more things like that in the future, kind of tighten that feedback loop even more."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Um, I think for, you know, you asked about like if this can be relevant to educators, like 100% online teaching is basically a form of live streaming now."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "Um, and usually it happens through zoom."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "I think if teachers view what they're doing as a kind of performance and a kind of live stream performance, um, that would probably be pretty healthy because zoom can be kind of awkward."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "Um, and I brought up this little blog post actually just on like just what our setup looked like if you want to adopt it yourself and how to integrate, um, like the broadcasting software OBS with zoom or things like that."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "It was really sorry to pause on that."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "I mean, yeah, maybe we could look at the blog post, but it looked really nice."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "The thing is, I knew nothing about any of that stuff before I started."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "I had a friend who knew a fair bit."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Um, and so he kind of helped show me the routes."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "One of the things that I realized is that you could, as a teacher, like it doesn't take that much to make things look and feel pretty professional."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "Um, like one component of it is as soon as you hook things up with the broadcasting software, rather than just doing like screen sharing, you can set up different scenes and then you can like have keyboard shortcuts to transition between those scenes."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "So you don't need a production studio with a director calling like, go to camera three, go to camera two, like onto the screen capture."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "Instead you can have control of that."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "And it took a little bit of practice and I would mess it up now and then, but I think I had it decently smooth such that, you know, I'm talking to the camera and then we're doing something on the paper."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "Then we're doing like a, um, playing with a Desmos graph or something."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "And something that I think in the past would have required a production team, you can actually do as a solo operation, um, and in particular as a teacher."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And I think it's worth it to try to do that because, uh, two reasons, one, you might get more engagement from the students, but the biggest reason I think one of the like best things that can come out of this pandemic education wise is if we turn a bunch of teachers into content creators."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "And if we take lessons that are usually done in these one off settings and like start to get in the habit of, um, sometimes I'll use the phrase commoditizing explanation where what you want is whatever a thing a student wants to learn."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "It just seems inefficient to me that that lesson is taught millions of times over in parallel across many different classrooms in the world."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "Like year to year, you've got a given algebra one lesson that's just taught like literally millions of times, um, by different people."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "What should happen is that there's the small handful of explanations online, uh, that exists so that when someone needs that explanation, they can go to it, that the time in classroom is spent on all of the parts of teaching and education that aren't explanation, which is most of it."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "Um, and the way to get there is to basically have more people who are already explaining, publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forum."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "So if during a pandemic you can have people automatically creating online content cause it has to be online, but getting into the habit of doing it in a, um, in a way that doesn't just feel like a zoom call that happened to be recorded, but it actually feels like a, a piece that was always going to be publicized to more people than just your students that can be really powerful."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And there's an improvement process there, like so being self critical and growing, like, you know, like I guess YouTubers go through this process of like putting out some content and like nobody caring about it and then trying to figure out like, and basically improving figure out like, why did nobody care?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "What can I, you know, and they come up with all kinds of answers, which may or may not be correct, but doesn't matter because the answer leads to improvement."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So you're being constantly self critical, self analytical, it should be better to say."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "So you think of like, how can I make the audio better?"}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Like all the basic things."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "Maybe one, one question to ask, cause, uh, well, by way of, uh, Russ Tedrick is a robotics professor at MIT, one of my favorite people, a big fan of yours."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "Uh, he watched our first conversation."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "I just interviewed him a couple of weeks ago."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "He, uh, he teaches this course in the under actuated robotics, which is, um, like robotic systems when you can't control everything, like when you're like, we as humans, when we walk, we're always falling forward, which

degrees of freedoms you have is not enough to fully control the system."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "It's a really, I think, beautiful, fascinating class."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "He puts it online."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "Um, it's quite popular."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "He does an incredible job teaching."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "He puts it online every time, but he's kind of been interested in like crisping it up, like, you know, making it, uh, you know, innovating in different kinds of ways."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And he was inspired by the work you do, because I think in his work, he can do similar kinds of explanations as you're doing, like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months in preparing a single video."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "Uh, and he's interested in how to do that."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "That's why he listened to the conversation."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "He was asking, you know, what kind of equipment do you recommend?"}, {"time": 4661, "text": "I guess like your blog post is a good one."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "I said, I don't recommend this is excessive and actually really hard to work with."}, {"time": 4669,

do you, for my narration, I use a USB mic for the streams that used to lapel mic, uh, the narration, it's a blue Yeti."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Um, I'm forgetting actually the name of the lapel mic, but it was probably like a road of some kind."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "Um, but is it hard to figure out how to make the audio sound good?"}, {"time": 4697, "text": "Oh, I mean, listen to all the early videos on my channel and clearly like I'm terrible at this for, for some reason."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "Um, I just couldn't get audio for awhile."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "I think I, it's weird when you hear your own voice."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So you hear it, you're like, this sounds weird and it's hard to notice it sound weird because you're not used to your own voice or they're like actual audio artifacts at play."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "Um, so, uh, and then video is just for the lockdown, just the camera, like you said, it was probably streaming somehow through the, yeah, there were two GH five cameras."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "One that was mounted overhead over a piece of paper."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "You could also use like an iPad or a Wacom tablet to do your writing electronically, but I just wanted the paper feel, um, one on the face."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "There's two."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "Um, again, I don't know, I'm like just not actually the one to ask this cause I like animate stuff usually, but, uh, each of them like has a compressor object that makes it such that the camera output goes into the computer USB, but like gets compressed before it does that."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "The, the live aspect of it, do you, do you regret doing it live?"}, {"time": 4761, "text": "Um, I think I do think the content might be like much less sharp and tight than if it were something, even that I just recorded like that and then edited later."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "But I do like something that I do to be out there to show like, Hey, this is what it's like."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "Raw."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "This is what it's like when I make mistakes."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "Um, this is like the pace of

clean what three blue and brown is about versus, uh, the benefits of like live lectures."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "Do you, uh, suggest like in this time of COVID that people like Russ or other

should do is, um, choose the small handful of topics that they're going to do just really well."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "They want to create the best short explanation of it in the world that will be one of those handfuls in a world where you have commoditized explanation, right?"}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Most of the lectures should be done just normally."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "Um, so put

it's sad that like, if you Google plasma or like for plasma physics, like there's no videos."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "And just imagine if every one of those excellent teachers like your father or like Russ, um, even if they just chose one topic this year, they're like, I'm going to make the best video that I can on this topic."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "If every one of the great teachers did that, the internet would be replete and it's already replete with great explanations."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "But it would be even more so with all the niche, great explanations and like anything you want to learn."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "Um, and there's a self interest to it for, in terms of teachers, in terms of even, so if you take Russ, for example, it's not that he's teaching something like he teaches his main thing, his thing he's deeply passionate about."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "And from a selfish perspective, it's also just like, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's like publishing a paper in a really, uh, like nature has like letters, like accessible publication."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "It's just going to guarantee that your work, that your passion is seen by a huge number of people, whatever the definition of huge is, doesn't matter."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "It's much more than it otherwise, uh, would be."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "And it's those lectures that tell

fear of like embarrassment."}, {"time": 5125, "text": "Like they, they definitely, it's, it's the same reason."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "Like I feel that anytime I put out a video, I don't know if

"text": "Now others could create videos on that topic as well, but as a collection, it creates a nice set of places to go."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "Uh, if you're curious about a particular topic and it seems like coronavirus is a nice opportunity to, uh, put that knowledge out there in the world at, uh, MIT and beyond, I have to talk to you a little bit about machine learning, deep learning and so on."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "Again, we talked about last time you have a set of beautiful videos on neural networks."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "Uh, let me ask you first, what is the most beautiful aspect of neural networks and machine learning to you, like for making those videos from watching how the field is evolving?"}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Is there something mathematically or in applied sense, just beautiful to you about them?"}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Well, I think what I would go to is the layered structure and how, um, you can have what feel like qualitatively distinct things happening, going from one layer to another, but that are, um, following the same mathematical rule because you look at it as a piece of math."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "It's like you got a non linearity and then you've got a matrix multiplication."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "That's what's happening on all the layers."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Um, but especially if you look at like some of the visualizations that, uh, like Chris Ola has done with respect to, um, like convolutional nets that have been trained on image net trying to say, what does this neuron do?"}, {"time": 5594, "text": "What do this, uh, does this family of neurons do?"}, {"time": 5597, "text": "What you can see is that, um, the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low level ideas like the texture, right?"}, {"time": 5604, "text": "And then as you get further back, you have higher level ideas."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "Like what is the, where are the eyes in this picture?"}, {"time": 5609, "text": "And then how do the eyes form like an animal is this animal, a cat or a dog or a deer."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "You have this series of qualitatively different things happening, even though it's the same piece of math on each one."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "So that's a pretty beautiful idea that you can have like a generalizable object that, um, runs through the layers of abstraction, which in some sense constitute intelligence is having, um, those many different layers of an understanding to something form abstractions in a automated way."}, {"time": 5638, "text": "It's automated abstracting, which, I mean, that just feels very powerful."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "Um, and the idea that it can be so simply mathematically represented."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "I mean, a ton of like modern ML research seems a little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc things, then you decide which one worked and then you retrospectively come up with the mathematical reason that it always had to work."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Um, but you know, who cares how you came to it when you have like that elegant piece of math?"}, {"time": 5660, "text": "Uh, it's hard not to just smile seeing it work in action."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Well, and when you talked about topology before, one of the really interesting things is, is beginning to be investigated under kind of the field of like science and deep learning, which is like the craziness of the surface that, uh, is trying to be optimized, uh, in neural networks."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "I mean, the, the amount of local minima, local optima there is in these surfaces and somehow a dumb gradient descent algorithm was able to find really good solutions."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "That's like, that's really surprising."}, {"time": 5698, "text": "Well, so on the one hand it is, but also it's like not, it's not terribly surprising that you have these interesting points that exist when you make your space so high dimensional, like GPT three, what did it have?"}, {"time": 5710, "text": "175 billion parameters."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "So it doesn't feel as mesmerizing to think about, Oh, there's some surface of intelligent behavior in this crazy high dimensional space."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Um, yeah, it's just that, that there's so many good solutions, probably infinitely infinitely many good solutions, not best solutions, but good solutions."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "That's that's what's interesting."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "It's similar to, uh, Steven Wolfram has this idea of like the, if you just look at all space of computations of all space of basically algorithms that you'd be surprised how many of them are actually intelligent."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "Like if you just randomly pick from the bucket, uh, that's surprising."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "We tend to think like a tiny, tiny minority of them would be intelligent, but his sense is like, it seems weirdly easy to find computations that do something interesting."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "Well, okay, so that from like a calm agor, calm agor of complexity standpoint, almost everything will be interesting."}, {"time": 5800, "text": "What's fascinating is to find the stuff that's describable with low information, but still does interesting things."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "Uh, like one fun example of this, you know, um, Shannon's noisy coding and theorem, uh, noisy coding theorem and, uh, information theory that basically says if, you know, I want to send some bits to you, um, maybe, uh, some of them are going to get flipped."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "Uh, there's some noise along the channel."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "I can come up with some way of coding it."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "That's resilient to that noise."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "Um, and then he quantitatively describes what very good is."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "What's funny about how he proves the existence of good error correction codes is rather than saying like, here's how to construct it or even like a sensible nonconstructive proof."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "The nature of his nonconstructive proof is to say, um, if we chose a random encoding, it would be almost at the limit, which is weird because then it took decades for people to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limit."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And what his proof was saying is choose a random one."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "And it's like the best kind of encoding you'll ever find."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "But what's what that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element from this ungodly huge set, that's a very different task from finding an efficient way to actively describe it."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "Cause in that case, the random element to actually implement it as a bit of code, you would just have this huge table of like, um, telling you how to encode one thing into another."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "That's totally computationally infeasible."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "So on the side of like how many possible programs are interesting in some way, it's like, yeah, tons of them."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "But the much, much more delicate question is when you can have a low information description of something that still becomes interesting."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And thereby this kind of gives you a blueprint for how to engineer that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "Chaos theory is another good instance there where it's like, yeah, a ton of things are hard to describe, but how do you have ones that have a simple set of governing equations that remain like arbitrarily hard to describe?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "Well, let me ask you, uh, you mentioned GPT three."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "It's interesting to ask, uh, what are your thoughts about the recently released open AI GPT three model that I believe is already trying to learn how to communicate like Grant Sanderson?"}, {"time": 5927, "text": "You know, I think I got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to, um, try to use GPT three with manum where you would like give it a high level description of something and then it'll like automatically create the mathematical animation, like trying to put me out of a job here."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "I mean, it probably won't put you out of a job, but it'll create something visually beautiful for sure."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "I would be surprised if that worked as stated, but maybe there's like variants of it like that you can get to."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "Um, I mean like a lot of those demos, it's interesting."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "I think, uh, there's a lot of failed experiments, like depending on how you prime the thing, you're going to have a lot of failed, I'm certainly with code and program synthesis."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "Most of it won't even run, but eventually I think if you, if you're, if you pick the right examples, you'll be able to generate something cool."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "And I think that even that's good enough, even though if it's, if it's, if you're being very selective, it's still cool that something can be generated."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "That's a huge value."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "Um, I mean, think of the writing process."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "Sometimes a big part of it is just getting a bunch of stuff on the page and then you can decide what to whittle down to."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "So if it can be used in like a man machine symbiosis where it's just giving you a spew of potential ideas that then you can refine down, um, like it's serving as the generator and then the human serves as the refiner."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "That seems like a pretty powerful dynamic."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Have you, uh, have you gotten a chance to see any of the demos like on Twitter?"}, {"time": 6014, "text": "Is there a favorite you've seen or?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "Oh, my absolute favorite."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "Uh, so Tim Blay who runs a channel called acapella science, he was like tweeting a bunch about playing with it."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "Um, and so he, so GPT three was trained on the internet from before COVID."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "So in a sense it doesn't know about the Corona virus."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "So what he seeded it with was just a short description about like, um, a novel virus, uh, emerges in Wuhan, China and starts to spread around the globe."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "What follows is a month by month description of what happens, January, colon, right?"}, {"time": 6046, "text": "That's what he sees it with."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "So then what GPT three generates is like January, then a paragraph of description, February and such."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And it's the funniest thing you'll ever read because, um, it predicts a zombie apocalypse, which of course it would because it's trained on like the internet, the stories, but what you see unfolding is a description of COVID 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "And like the early aspects of it are kind of shockingly in line with what's reasonable and then it gets out of hand so quickly."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And the other flip side of that is, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's onto something at some point here when, you know, 2020 has been full of surprises, who knows, like we might all be in like this crazy militarized zone as it predicts just a couple of months off."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "I think there's definitely an interesting tool of storytelling."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "I honestly haven't dug into like what's going on within it, uh, in a way that I can speak intelligently to, I guess it doesn't surprise me that it's bad at numerical patterns because I mean, maybe I should be more impressed with it, but like that requires having, um, a weird combination of intuitive and, uh, and formulaic worldview."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So you're not just going off of intuition."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "When you see Fibonacci numbers, you're not saying like intuitively, what do I think will follow the 13?"}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Like I've seen patterns a lot where like 13s are followed by 21s instead."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "It's the, like the way you're starting to see a shape of things is by knowing what hypotheses to test where you're saying, oh, maybe it's generated based on the previous terms or maybe it's generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you like have a bunch of different hypotheses and your intuitions are around those hypotheses, but you still need to actively test it."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "Um, and it seems like GPT three is extremely good at, um, like that sort of pattern matching recognition that usually is very hard for computers."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "That is what humans get good at through expertise and exposure to lots of things."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "It's why it's good to learn from as many examples as you can rather than just from the definitions it's to get that level of intuition, but to actually concretize it into a piece of math, you do need to, um, like test your hypotheses and if not prove it, um, like have an actual explanation for what's going on, not just a, uh, a pattern that you've seen."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And, but then the flip side to play devil's advocate, that's a very kind of probably correct intuitive understanding of just like we said, a few, a few layers creating abstractions, but it's been able to form something that looks like, uh, a compression of the data that it's seen that looks awfully a lot like it understands what the heck it's talking about."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "Well, I think a lot of understanding is like, I don't mean to denigrate pattern recognition."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "Pattern recognition is most of understanding and it's super important and it's super hard."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "Um, and so like when it's demonstrating this kind of real understanding, compressing down some data, like that, that might be pattern recognition at its finest."}, {"time": 6260, "text": "My only point would be that like what differentiates math, I think to a large extent is that, um, the pattern recognition isn't sufficient and that the kind of patterns that you're recognizing are not like the end goals, but instead they're, they are the little bits and paths that get you to the end goal."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "That's certainly true for mathematics in general."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "It's an interesting question if that might, uh, for certain kinds of series of numbers, it might not be true."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "Like you might, um, because that's a basic, you know, like Taylor's like certain kinds of series, it feels like compressing the internet, uh, is, is enough to figure out because those patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Well, I mean, there's, uh, there's all sorts of wonderful examples of false patterns in math where, um, one of the earliest videos I put on the channel was talking about the extent of dividing a circle up using these chords."}, {"time": 6315, "text": "And you see this pattern of one, two, four, eight, 16, I was like, okay, pretty easy to see what that pattern is."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "It's powers of two."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "You've seen it a million times."}, {"time": 6323, "text": "Um, but it's not powers of two."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "The next term is 31."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "And so it's like almost a power of two, but it's a little bit shy."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "And there's, there's actually a very good explanation for what's going on."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "So at best, if it did turn out to be powers of two, it would have only been so very subtly."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "And I think the difference between like, you know, a math student making the mistake and a mathematician who's experienced seeing that kind of pattern is that they, they'll have a sense from what the problem itself is, whether the pattern that they're observing is reasonable and how to test it."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "And like, uh, I w I would just be very impressed if there was any algorithm that, um, was actively accomplishing that goal."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "Like a learning base algorithm."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "Like a little scientist, I guess."}, {"time": 6389, "text": "Basically."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "That's a fascinating thought because GPT three, these language models are already accomplishing way more than I've expected."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "So I'm learning not to doubt, but we'll get there."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "I, I, I'm not saying I'd be impressed, but like surprised, like I'll be impressed, but I think we'll get there on, um, algorithms doing math like that."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So one of the amazing things you've done for the world is to some degree, open sourcing the tooling that you use to make your videos with Madam, uh, this Python library."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "Now it's quickly evolving because I think you're inventing new things every time you make a video."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "In fact, I wanted, um, I've been working on playing around with something."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "I wanted to do like an ode to three blue on Brown."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "Like I love playing Hendrix."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "I wanted to do like a cover, you know, of a concept I wanted to visualize and use Madam."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "And I saw that you had like a little piece of code on like Mobia strip and I tried to do some cool things with spinning a Mobia strip, like continue, um, twisting it, I guess is the term, uh, and it was easier to, uh, it was tough."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "So I haven't figured it out yet."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "Well, so I guess the question I want to ask is so many people love it, uh, that you've put that out there."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "They want to, uh, do the same thing as I do with Hendrix and want to cover it."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "They want to explain an idea using the tool, including Russ."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "How would you recommend they try to, I'm very sorry."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "They try to go, they try to go by, uh, about it and what kind of choices should they choose to be most effective?"}, {"time": 6493, "text": "That I can answer."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "So I always feel guilty if this comes up because, um, I think of it like this scrappy tool."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "It's like a math teacher who put together some code."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "People asked what it was, so they made it open source and they kept scrapping it together."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And there's a lot, like a lot of things about it that make it harder to work with than it needs to be that are a function of like me not being a software engineer."}, {"time": 6513, "text": "Um, I, I've, I've put some work this year trying to like make it better and more flexible."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Um, that is still just kind of like a work in process."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "Um, one thing I would love to do is just get my act together about properly integrating with what like the community wants to work with and like what stuff I work on and making that, um, not like deviate, uh, and just like actually fostering that community in a way that I've, I've been like shamefully neglectful of."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "So I'm just always guilty if it comes up."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "So let's put that guilt aside, just kind of Zen, like I'll pretend like it isn't terrible for someone like Russ."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Um, I think step one is like, make sure that what you're animating should be done so programmatically because a lot of things maybe shouldn't."}, {"time": 6556, "text": "Um, like if you're just making a quick graph of something, uh, if it's a graphical intuition that maybe has a little motion to it, use Desmos, use grapher, use GeoGebra, use Mathematica, certain things that are like really oriented around graph."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "GeoGebra is kind of cool."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "I did super amazing."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "You can get very, very far with it."}, {"time": 6573, "text": "Um, and in a lot of ways, like it would make more sense for STEM stuff that I do to just do in GeoGebra, but I kind of have this cycle of liking to try to improve man and by doing videos and such."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "So, uh, do as I say, not as I do."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "The original like thought I had in making manum was that there's so many different ways of representing functions other than graphs, um, in particular things like transformations, like use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead of like estimate direction and Y direction, um, or like vector fields or things like that."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "So I wanted something that was flexible enough that you didn't feel constrained into a graphical environment."},

as I do."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "I mean, Python is an integral part of it."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "Just for the fun of it, let me ask, uh, what, uh, what's your most and least favorite aspects

and sort of the beautiful, interesting, insightful mathematics in that world, whether we're talking about quantum mechanics, which you touched on in a bunch of your videos a little bit, quaternions,

concepts that are like within reach."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "Yeah, I think that's super important."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "I mean, so you see this in math too with, um, the big unsolved problems."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So like the clay millennium problems, Riemann hypothesis, um, have you ever done a video on Fermat's last theorem?"}, {"time": 7170, "text": "No, I have not yet."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "But if I did, do you know what I would do?"}, {"time": 7174, "text": "I would talk about, um, proving Fermat's last theorem in the specific case of N equals three."},

7186, "text": "He does a good job of taking stuff that's barely accessible and making it, but the, the core ideas of proving it for N equals three are hard, but they do get you real ideas about

other contexts and you can get to a okay understanding of that."}, {"time": 7215, "text": "And the things that make Fermat's last theorem hard are actually quite deep."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "Um, and so the cases that we can solve it for, it's like you can get these broad sweeps based on some hard, but like accessible, um, bits of number theory."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "But before you can even understand why the general case is as hard as it is, you have to walk through those."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "And so any other attempt to describe it would just end up being like shallow and not really productive for the viewer's time."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Um, I think the same goes for, uh, most like unsolved problem type things where I think, you know, as a kid, I was actually very inspired by the twin prime conjecture, um, that like totally sucked me in as this thing that was understandable."}, {"time": 7252, "text": "I kind of had this dream like, Oh, maybe I'll be the one to prove the twin prime conjecture and new math that I would learn would be like viewed through this lens of like, Oh, maybe I can apply it to that in some way."}, {"time": 7261, "text": "But, uh, you sort of mature to a point where you realize that, uh, you should spend your brain cycles on problems that you will see resolved because then you're going to grow to see what it feels like for these things to be resolved rather than spending your brain cycles on something where it's not, it's not going to pan out."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "Um, and the people who do make progress towards these things like James Maynard, uh, is a great example here of like young creative mathematician who like pushes in the direction of things like the twin prime conjecture rather than hitting that head on, just see all the interesting questions that are hard for similar reasons, but become more tractable and let themselves really engage with those."}, {"time": 7298, "text": "Um, so I think people should get in that habit."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "I think the popularization of physics should encourage that habit through things like the physics of simple everyday phenomena, because it can get quite deep."}, {"time": 7310, "text": "And um, yeah, I think I, you know, I've, I've heard a lot of the interest that, you know, people send me messages asking to explain Weinstein's thing or asking to explain Wolfram's thing."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "One, I don't understand them, but more importantly, um, it's too big a bite to, you shouldn't be interested in those, right?"}, {"time": 7328,

7337, "text": "And to be clear, you should be interested in fundamental questions."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "I think that's a good habit to ask what the fundamentals of things are, but I think it takes a lot of steps to like, certainly you shouldn't be trying to answer that unless you actually understand quantum field theory and you actually understand general relativity."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "That's the cool thing about like your videos, people who haven't done mathematics, like if you really give it time, watch it a couple of times and like try to try to reason about it, you can actually understand the concept that's being explained."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "And it's not a coincidence that the things I'm describing aren't like the most, um, up to date, uh, progress on the Riemann hypothesis cousins or, um, like there's context in which the analog of the Riemann hypothesis has been solved in like more, uh, discrete feeling finite settings that are more well behaved."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "I'm not describing that because it just takes a ton to get there."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And instead I think it'll be like productive to have an actual understanding of something that can, you can pack into 20 minutes."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "I think that's beautifully put ultimately."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "That's where like the most satisfying thing is when
