their minds to that we've said, oh, we reached the wall, we can't go any further."}, {"time": 299, "text": "It's just, people keep saying that."}, {"time": 301, "text": "People used to believe that about life."}, {"time": 303, "text": "Alain Vital, right, there's like, what's the difference between living matter and nonliving matter, something special that we never understand."}, {"time": 309, "text": "We no longer think that."}, {"time": 310, "text": "So there's no historical evidence that suggests this is the case, and I just never even consider that's a possibility."}, {"time": 317, "text": "I would also say, today, we understand so much about the neocortex."}, {"time": 322, "text": "We've made tremendous progress in the last few years that I no longer think of it as an open question."}, {"time": 330, "text": "The answers are very clear to me."}, {"time": 332, "text": "The pieces we don't know are clear to me, but the framework is all there, and it's like, oh, okay, we're gonna be able to do this."}, {"time": 338, "text": "This is not a problem anymore, just takes time and effort, but there's no mystery, a big mystery anymore."}, {"time": 344, "text": "So then let's get into it for people like myself who are not very well versed in the human brain, except my own."}, {"time": 354, "text": "Can you describe to me, at the highest level, what are the different parts of the human brain, and then zooming in on the neocortex, the parts of the neocortex, and so on, a quick overview."}, {"time": 366, "text": "The human brain, we can divide it roughly into two parts."}, {"time": 370, "text": "There's the old parts, lots of pieces, and then there's the new part."}, {"time": 375, "text": "The new part is the neocortex."}, {"time": 378, "text": "It's new because it didn't exist before mammals."}, {"time": 380, "text": "The only mammals have a neocortex, and in humans, in primates, it's very large."}, {"time": 384, "text": "In the human brain, the neocortex occupies about 70 to 75% of the volume of the brain."}, {"time": 392, "text": "And the old parts of the brain are, there's lots of pieces there."}, {"time": 396, "text": "There's the spinal cord, and there's the brain stem, and the cerebellum, and the different parts of the basal ganglia, and so on."}, {"time": 402, "text": "In the old parts of the brain, you have the autonomic regulation, like breathing and heart rate."}, {"time": 406, "text": "You have basic behaviors, so like walking and running are controlled by the old parts of the brain."}, {"time": 411, "text": "All the emotional centers of the brain are in the old part of the brain, so when you feel anger or hungry, lust, or things like that, those are all in the old parts of the brain."}, {"time": 417, "text": "And we associate with the neocortex all the things we think about as sort of high level perception and cognitive functions, anything from seeing and hearing and touching things to language to mathematics and engineering and science and so on."}, {"time": 436, "text": "Those are all associated with the neocortex, and they're certainly correlated."}, {"time": 441, "text": "Our abilities in those regards are correlated with the relative size of our neocortex compared to other mammals."}, {"time": 447, "text": "So that's like the rough division, and you obviously can't understand the neocortex completely isolated, but you can understand a lot of it with just a few interfaces to the old parts of the brain, and so it gives you a system to study."}, {"time": 464, "text": "The other remarkable thing about the neocortex, compared to the old parts of the brain, is the neocortex is extremely uniform."}, {"time": 472, "text": "It's not visibly or anatomically, it's very, I always like to say it's like the size of a dinner napkin, about two and a half millimeters thick, and it looks remarkably the same everywhere."}, {"time": 485, "text": "Everywhere you look in that two and a half millimeters is this detailed architecture, and it looks remarkably the same everywhere, and that's across species."}, {"time": 492, "text": "A mouse versus a cat and a dog and a human."}, {"time": 495, "text": "Where if you look at the old parts of the brain, there's lots of little pieces do specific things."}, {"time": 519, "text": "This is like, wow, this is incredible."}, {"time": 522, "text": "So all the evidence we have, and this is an idea that was first articulated in a very cogent and beautiful argument by a guy named Vernon Malcastle in 1978, I think it was, that the neocortex all works on the same principle."}, {"time": 541, "text": "So language, hearing, touch, vision, engineering, all these things are basically underlying, are all built on the same computational substrate."}, {"time": 550, "text": "They're really all the same problem."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So the low level of the building blocks all look similar."}, {"time": 554, "text": "Yeah, and they're not even that low level."}, {"time": 556, "text": "We're not talking about like neurons."}, {"time": 557, "text": "We're talking about this very complex circuit that exists throughout the neocortex."}, {"time": 561, "text": "It's remarkably similar."}, {"time": 563, "text": "It's like, yes, you see variations of it here and there, more of the cell, less and less, and so on."}, {"time": 569, "text": "But what Malcastle argued was, he says, you know, if you take a section of neocortex, why is one a visual area and one is a auditory area?"}, {"time": 578, "text": "Or why is, and his answer was, it's because one is connected to eyes and one is connected to ears."}, {"time": 585, "text": "Literally, you mean just it's most closest in terms of number of connections to the sensor."}, {"time": 589, "text": "Literally, literally, if you took the optic nerve and attached it to a different part of the neocortex, that part would become a visual region."}, {"time": 597, "text": "This actually, this experiment was actually done by Merkankasur in developing, I think it was lemurs, I can't remember what it was, some animal."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And there's a lot of evidence to this."}, {"time": 608, "text": "You know, if you take a blind person, a person who's born blind at birth, they're born with a visual neocortex."}, {"time": 615, "text": "It doesn't, may not get any input from the eyes because of some congenital defect or something."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And that region becomes, does something else."}, {"time": 624, "text": "It picks up another task."}, {"time": 627, "text": "So, and it's, so it's this very complex thing."}, {"time": 632, "text": "It's not like, oh, they're all built on neurons."}, {"time": 633, "text": "No, they're all built in this very complex circuit and somehow that circuit underlies everything."}, {"time": 640, "text": "And so this is the, it's called the common cortical algorithm, if you will."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Some scientists just find it hard to believe and they just, I can't believe that's true, but the evidence is overwhelming in this case."}, {"time": 652, "text": "And so a large part of what it means to figure out how the brain creates intelligence and what is intelligence in the brain is to understand what that circuit does."}, {"time": 662, "text": "If you can figure out what that circuit does, as amazing as it is, then you can, then you understand what all these other cognitive functions are."}, {"time": 670, "text": "So if you were to sort of put neocortex outside of your book on intelligence, you look, if you wrote a giant tome, a textbook on the neocortex, and you look maybe a couple of centuries from now, how much of what we know now would still be accurate two centuries from now?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "So how close are we in terms of understanding?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "I have to speak from my own particular experience here."}, {"time": 692, "text": "So I run a small research lab here."}, {"time": 695, "text": "It's like any other research lab."}, {"time": 698, "text": "I'm sort of the principal investigator."}, {"time": 699, "text": "There's actually two of us and there's a bunch of other people."}, {"time": 702, "text": "And this is what we do."}, {"time": 703, "text": "We study the neocortex and we publish our results and so on."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So about three years ago, we had a real breakthrough in this field."}, {"time": 712, "text": "Just tremendous breakthrough."}, {"time": 713, "text": "We've now published, I think, three papers on it."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And so I have a pretty good understanding of all the pieces and what we're missing."}, {"time": 722, "text": "I would say that almost all the empirical data we've collected about the brain, which is enormous."}, {"time": 728, "text": "If you don't know the neuroscience literature, it's just incredibly big."}, {"time": 733, "text": "And it's, for the most part, all correct."}, {"time": 736, "text": "It's facts and experimental results and measurements and all kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 742, "text": "But none of that has been really assimilated into a theoretical framework."}, {"time": 747, "text": "It's data without, in the language of Thomas Kuhn, the historian, would be a sort of a pre paradigm science."}, {"time": 755, "text": "Lots of data, but no way to fit it together."}, {"time": 758, "text": "I think almost all of that's correct."}, {"time": 759, "text": "There's just gonna be some mistakes in there."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And for the most part, there aren't really good cogent theories about it, how to put it together."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It's not like we have two or three competing good theories, which ones are right and which ones are wrong."}, {"time": 771, "text": "It's like, nah, people are just scratching their heads."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Some people have given up on trying to figure out what the whole thing does."}, {"time": 777, "text": "In fact, there's very, very few labs that we do that focus really on theory and all this unassimilated data and trying to explain it."}, {"time": 786, "text": "So it's not like we've got it wrong."}, {"time": 788, "text": "It's just that we haven't got it at all."}, {"time": 791, "text": "So it's really, I would say, pretty early days in terms of understanding the fundamental theory's forces of the way our mind works."}, {"time": 801, "text": "I would have said that's true five years ago."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So as I said, we had some really big breakthroughs on this recently and we started publishing papers on this."}, {"time": 810, "text": "So we'll get to that."}, {"time": 814, "text": "But so I don't think it's, I'm an optimist and from where I sit today, most people would disagree with this, but from where I sit today, from what I know, it's not super early days anymore."}, {"time": 824, "text": "We are, the way these things go is it's not a linear path, right?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "You don't just start accumulating and get better and better and better."}, {"time": 830, "text": "No, all this stuff you've collected, none of it makes sense."}, {"time": 833, "text": "All these different things are just sort of around."}, {"time": 835, "text": "And then you're gonna have some breaking points where all of a sudden, oh my God, now we got it right."}, {"time": 839, "text": "That's how it goes in science."}, {"time": 841, "text": "And I personally feel like we passed that little thing about a couple of years ago, all that big thing a couple of years ago."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So we can talk about that."}, {"time": 849, "text": "Time will tell if I'm right, but I feel very confident about it."}, {"time": 852, "text": "That's why I'm willing to say it on tape like this."}, {"time": 855, "text": "At least very optimistic."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So let's, before those few years ago, let's take a step back to HTM, the hierarchical temporal memory theory, which you first proposed on intelligence and went through a few different generations."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Can you describe what it is, how it evolved through the three generations since you first put it on paper?"}, {"time": 875, "text": "Yeah, so one of the things that neuroscientists just sort of missed for many, many years, and especially people who were thinking about theory, was the nature of time in the brain."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Brains process information through time."}, {"time": 891, "text": "The information coming into the brain is constantly changing."}, {"time": 895, "text": "The patterns from my speech right now, if you were listening to it at normal speed, would be changing on your ears about every 10 milliseconds or so, you'd have a change."}, {"time": 904, "text": "This constant flow, when you look at the world, your eyes are moving constantly, three to five times a second, and the input's completely changing."}, {"time": 911, "text": "If I were to touch something like a coffee cup, as I move my fingers, the input changes."}, {"time": 915, "text": "So this idea that the brain works on time changing patterns is almost completely, or was almost completely missing from a lot of the basic theories, like fears of vision and so on."}, {"time": 925, "text": "It's like, oh no, we're gonna put this image in front of you and flash it and say, what is it?"}, {"time": 929, "text": "Convolutional neural networks work that way today, right?"}, {"time": 932, "text": "Classify this picture."}, {"time": 934, "text": "But that's not what vision is like."}, {"time": 935, "text": "Vision is this sort of crazy time based pattern that's going all over the place, and so is touch and so is hearing."}, {"time": 941, "text": "So the first part of hierarchical temporal memory was the temporal part."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's to say, you won't understand the brain, nor will you understand intelligent machines unless you're dealing with time based patterns."}, {"time": 952, "text": "The second thing was, the memory component of it was, is to say that we aren't just processing input, we learn a model of the world."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And the memory stands for that model."}, {"time": 965, "text": "The point of the brain, the part of the neocortex, it learns a model of the world."}, {"time": 968, "text": "We have to store things, our experiences, in a form that leads to a model of the world."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So we can move around the world, we can pick things up and do things and navigate and know how it's going on."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So that's what the memory referred to."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And many people just, they were thinking about like certain processes without memory at all."}, {"time": 985, "text": "They're just like processing things."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And then finally, the hierarchical component was a reflection to that the neocortex, although it's this uniform sheet of cells, different parts of it project to other parts, which project to other parts."}, {"time": 999, "text": "And there is a sort of rough hierarchy in terms of that."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "So the hierarchical temporal memory is just saying, look, we should be thinking about the brain as time based, model memory based, and hierarchical processing."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And that was a placeholder for a bunch of components that we would then plug into that."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "We still believe all those things I just said, but we now know so much more that I'm stopping to use the word hierarchical temporal memory yet because it's insufficient to capture the stuff we know."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So again, it's not incorrect, but it's, I now know more and I would rather describe it more accurately."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Yeah, so you're basically, we could think of HTM as emphasizing that there's three aspects of intelligence that are important to think about whatever the eventual theory it converges to."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So in terms of time, how do you think of nature of time across different time scales?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "So you mentioned things changing, sensory inputs changing every 10, 20 minutes."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "What about every few minutes, every few months and years?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Well, if you think about a neuroscience problem, the brain problem, neurons themselves can stay active for certain periods of time, parts of the brain where they stay active for minutes."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "You could hold a certain perception or an activity for a certain period of time, but most of them don't last that long."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And so if you think about your thoughts are the activity of neurons, if you're gonna wanna involve something that happened a long time ago, even just this morning, for example, the neurons haven't been active throughout that time."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So you have to store that."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So if I ask you, what did you have for breakfast today?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "That is memory, that is you've built into your model the world now, you remember that."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And that memory is in the synapses, is basically in the formation of synapses."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "And so you're sliding into what, you know, it's the different timescales."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "There's timescales of which we are like understanding my language and moving about and seeing things rapidly and over time, that's the timescales of activities of neurons."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "But if you wanna get in longer timescales, then it's more memory."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And we have to invoke those memories to say, oh yes, well now I can remember what I had for breakfast because I stored that someplace."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "I may forget it tomorrow, but I'd store it for now."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "So does memory also need to have, so the hierarchical aspect of reality is not just about concepts, it's also about time?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Do you think of it that way?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Yeah, time is infused in everything."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's like you really can't separate it out."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "If I ask you, what is your, you know, how's the brain learn a model of this coffee cup here?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "I have a coffee cup and I'm at the coffee cup."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I say, well, time is not an inherent property of the model I have of this cup, whether it's a visual model or a tactile model."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I can sense it through time, but the model itself doesn't really have much time."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "If I asked you, if I said, well, what is the model of my cell phone?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "My brain has learned a model of the cell phone."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "So if you have a smartphone like this, and I said, well, this has time aspects to it."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "I have expectations when I turn it on, what's gonna happen, what or how long it's gonna take to do certain things, if I bring up an app, what sequences, and so I have, and it's like melodies in the world, you know?"}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Melody has a sense of time."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So many things in the world move and act, and there's a sense of time related to them."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Some don't, but most things do actually."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So it's sort of infused throughout the models of the world."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "You build a model of the world, you're learning the structure of the objects in the world, and you're also learning how those things change through time."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Okay, so it really is just a fourth dimension that's infused deeply, and you have to make sure that your models of intelligence incorporate it."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So, like you mentioned, the state of neuroscience is deeply empirical, a lot of data collection."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It's, you know, that's where it is."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "You mentioned Thomas Kuhn, right?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you're proposing a theory of intelligence, and which is really the next step, the really important step to take, but why is HTM, or what we'll talk about soon, the right theory?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "So is it more in the, is it backed by intuition?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Is it backed by evidence?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Is it backed by a mixture of both?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Is it kind of closer to where string theory is in physics, where there's mathematical components which show that, you know what, it seems that this, it fits together too well for it not to be true, which is where string theory is."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Is that where you're kind of seeing?"}, {"time": 1289, "text": "It's a mixture of all those things, although definitely where we are right now is definitely much more on the empirical side than, let's say, string theory."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "The way this goes about, we're theorists, right?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So we look at all this data, and we're trying to come up with some sort of model that explains it, basically, and there's, unlike string theory, there's vast more amounts of empirical data here that I think than most physicists deal with."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And so our challenge is to sort through that and figure out what kind of constructs would explain this."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And when we have an idea, you come up with a theory of some sort, you have lots of ways of testing it."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "First of all, there are 100 years of assimilated, assimilated, unassimilated empirical data from neuroscience."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So we go back and read papers, and we say, oh, did someone find this already?"}, {"time": 1340, "text": "We can predict X, Y, and Z, and maybe no one's even talked about it since 1972 or something, but we go back and find that, and we say, oh, either it can support the theory or it can invalidate the theory."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And we say, okay, we have to start over again."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Oh, no, it's supportive, let's keep going with that one."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So the way I kind of view it, when we do our work, we look at all this empirical data, and what I call it is a set of constraints."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "We're not interested in something that's biologically inspired."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "We're trying to figure out how the actual brain works."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So every piece of empirical data is a constraint on a theory."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "In theory, if you have the correct theory, it needs to explain every pin, right?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So we have this huge number of constraints on the problem, which initially makes it very, very difficult."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "If you don't have many constraints, you can make up stuff all the day."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "You can say, oh, here's an answer on how you can do this, you can do that, you can do this."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "But if you consider all biology as a set of constraints, all neuroscience as a set of constraints, and even if you're working in one little part of the neocortex, for example, there are hundreds and hundreds of constraints."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "These are empirical constraints that it's very, very difficult initially to come up with a theoretical framework for that."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "But when you do, and it solves all those constraints at once, you have a high confidence that you got something close to correct."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "It's just mathematically almost impossible not to be."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So that's the curse and the advantage of what we have."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "The curse is we have to solve, we have to meet all these constraints, which is really hard."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But when you do meet them, then you have a great confidence that you've discovered something."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "In addition, then we work with scientific labs."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So we'll say, oh, there's something we can't find, we can predict something, but we can't find it anywhere in the literature."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "So we will then, we have people we've collaborated with, we'll say, sometimes they'll say, you know what?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I have some collected data, which I didn't publish, but we can go back and look at it and see if we can find that, which is much easier than designing a new experiment."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "You know, neuroscience experiments take a long time, years."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So, although some people are doing that now too."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So, but between all of these things, I think it's a reasonable, actually a very, very good approach."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "We are blessed with the fact that we can test our theories out the yin yang here because there's so much unassimilar data and we can also falsify our theories very easily, which we do often."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "So it's kind of reminiscent to whenever that was with Copernicus, you know, when you figure out that the sun's at the center of the solar system as opposed to earth, the pieces just fall into place."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Yeah, I think that's the general nature of aha moments is, and it's Copernicus, it could be, you could say the same thing about Darwin, you could say the same thing about, you know, about the double helix, that people have been working on a problem for so long and have all this data and they can't make sense of it, they can't make sense of it."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "But when the answer comes to you and everything falls into place, it's like, oh my gosh, that's it."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "That's got to be right."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I asked both Jim Watson and Francis Crick about this."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "I asked them, you know, when you were working on trying to discover the structure of the double helix, and when you came up with the sort of the structure that ended up being correct, but it was sort of a guess, you know, it wasn't really verified yet."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I

fact, the last time was a little bit over a year ago, I gave a talk at Cold Spring Harbor Labs about the progress we were making in our work."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And it was a lot of fun because

much, let's start with a little preface."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Many of the things that humans are able to do do not have obvious survival advantages precedent."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "We could create music, is that, is there a really survival advantage to that?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Maybe, maybe not."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "What about mathematics?"}, {"time": 1864, "text": "Is there a real survival advantage to mathematics?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Well, you could stretch it."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "You can try to figure these things out, right?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "But most of evolutionary history, everything had immediate survival advantages to it."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So, I'll tell you a story, which I like, may or may not be true, but the story goes as follows."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Organisms have been evolving for, since the beginning of life here on Earth, and adding this sort of complexity onto that, and this sort of complexity onto that, and the brain itself is evolved this way."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "In fact, there's old parts, and older parts, and older, older parts of the brain that kind of just keeps calming on new things, and we keep adding capabilities."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "When we got to the neocortex, initially it had a very clear survival advantage in that it produced better vision, and better hearing, and better touch, and maybe, and so on."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "But what I think happens is that evolution discovered, it took a mechanism, and this is in our recent theories, but it took a mechanism evolved a long time ago for navigating in the world, for knowing where you are."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "These are the so called grid cells and place cells of an old part of the brain."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And it took that mechanism for building maps of the world, and knowing where you are on those maps, and how to navigate those maps, and turns it into a sort of a slimmed down, idealized version of it."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And that idealized version could now apply to building maps of other things."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "Maps of coffee cups, and maps of phones, maps of mathematics."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Concepts almost."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Concepts, yes, and not just almost, exactly."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "And so, and it just started replicating this stuff, right?"}, {"time": 1964, "text": "You just think more, and more, and more."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So we went from being sort of dedicated purpose neural hardware to solve certain problems that are important to survival, to a general purpose neural hardware that could be applied to all problems."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And now it's escaped the orbit of survival."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "We are now able to apply it to things which we find enjoyment, but aren't really clearly survival characteristics."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "And that it seems to only have happened in humans, to the large extent."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And so that's what's going on, where we sort of have, we've sort of escaped the gravity of evolutionary pressure, in some sense, in the neocortex."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And it now does things which are not, that are really interesting, discovering models of the universe, which may not really help us."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Does it matter?"}, {"time": 2017, "text": "How does it help us surviving, knowing that there might be multiverses, or that there might be the age of the universe, or how do various stellar things occur?"}, {"time": 2026, "text": "It doesn't really help us survive at all."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "But we enjoy it, and that's what happened."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "Or at least not in the obvious way, perhaps."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "It is required, if you look at the entire universe in an evolutionary way, it's required for us to do interplanetary travel, and therefore survive past our own sun."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "But you know, let's not get too."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Yeah, but evolution works at one time frame, it's survival, if you think of survival of the phenotype, survival of the individual."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "What you're talking about there is spans well beyond that."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So there's no genetic, I'm not transferring any

new, as you've mentioned, this idea of the, I don't know if you have a nice name, thousand."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "We call it the thousand brain theory of intelligence."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "I like it."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "Can you talk about this idea of a spatial view of concepts and so on?"}, {"time": 2084, "text": "Yeah, so can I just describe sort of the, there's an underlying core discovery, which then everything comes from that."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "That's a very simple, this is really what happened."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "We were deep into problems about understanding how we build models of stuff in the world and how we make predictions about things."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And I was holding a coffee cup just like this in my hand."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "And my finger was touching the side, my index finger."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "And then I moved it to the top and I was gonna feel the rim at the top of the cup."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And I asked myself a very simple question."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "I said, well, first of all, I say, I know that my brain predicts what it's gonna feel before it touches it."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "You can just think about it and imagine it."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And so we know that the brain's making predictions all the time."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So the question is, what does it take to predict that?"}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And there's a very interesting answer."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "First of all, it says the brain has to know it's touching a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It has to have a model of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "It needs to know where the finger currently is on the cup relative to the cup."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Because when I make a movement, it needs to know where it's going to be on the cup after the movement is completed relative to the cup."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "And then it can make a prediction about what it's gonna sense."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So this told me that the neocortex, which is making this prediction, needs to know that it's sensing it's touching a cup."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And it needs to know the location of my finger relative to that cup in a reference frame of the cup."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "It doesn't matter where the cup is relative to my body."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "It doesn't matter its orientation."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "None of that matters."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "It's where my finger is relative to the cup, which tells me then that the neocortex has a reference frame that's anchored to the cup."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Because otherwise I wouldn't be able to say the location and I wouldn't be able to predict my new location."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And then we quickly, very instantly can say, well, every part of my skin could touch this cup."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And therefore every part of my skin is making predictions and every part of my skin must have a reference frame that it's using to make predictions."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "So the big idea is that throughout the neocortex, there are, everything is being stored and referenced in reference frames."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "You can think of them like XYZ reference frames, but they're not like that."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "We know a lot about the neural mechanisms for this, but the brain thinks in reference frames."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "And as an engineer, if you're an engineer, this is not surprising."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "You'd say, if I wanted to build a CAD model of the coffee cup, well, I would bring it up and some CAD software, and I would assign some reference frame and say this features at this locations and so on."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "But the fact that this, the idea that this is occurring throughout the neocortex everywhere, it was a novel idea."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "And then a zillion things fell into place after that, a zillion."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "So now we think about the neocortex as processing information quite differently than we used to do it."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "We used to think about the neocortex as processing sensory data and extracting features from that sensory data and then extracting features from the features, very much like a deep learning network does today."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "But that's not how the brain works at all."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "The brain works by assigning everything, every input, everything to reference frames."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of them active at once in your neocortex."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "It's a surprising thing to think about, but once you sort of internalize this, you understand that it explains almost every, almost all the mysteries we've had about this structure."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So one of the consequences of that is that every small part of the neocortex, say a millimeter square, and there's 150,000 of those."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So it's about 150,000 square millimeters."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "If you take every little square millimeter of the cortex, it's got some input coming into it and it's gonna have reference frames where it's assigned that input to."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And each square millimeter can learn complete models of objects."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "So what do I mean by that?"}, {"time": 2302, "text": "If I'm touching the coffee cup, well, if I just touch it in one place, I can't learn what this coffee cup is because I'm just feeling one part."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "But if I move it around the cup and touch it at different areas, I can build up a complete model of the cup because I'm now filling in that three dimensional map, which is the coffee cup."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "I can say, oh, what am I feeling at all these different locations?"}, {"time": 2319, "text": "That's the basic idea, it's more complicated than that."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "But so through time, and we talked about time earlier, through time, even a single column, which is only looking at, or a single part of the cortex, which is only looking at a small part of the world, can build up a complete model of an object."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And so if you think about the part of the brain, which is getting input from all my fingers, so they're spread across the top of your head here."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "This is the somatosensory cortex."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "There's columns associated with all the different areas of my skin."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "And what we believe is happening is that all of them are building models of this cup, every one of them, or things."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "They're not all building, not every column or every part of the cortex builds models of everything, but they're all building models of something."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "And so you have, so when I touch this cup with my hand, there are multiple models of the cup being invoked."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "If I look at it with my eyes, there are, again, many models of the cup being invoked, because each part of the visual system, the brain doesn't process an image."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "That's a misleading idea."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It's just like your fingers touching the cup, so different parts of my retina are looking at different parts of the cup."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "And thousands and thousands of models of the cup are being invoked at once."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And they're all voting with each other, trying to figure out what's going on."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "So that's why we call it the thousand brains theory of intelligence, because there isn't one model of a cup."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "There are thousands of models of this cup."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "There are thousands of models of your cellphone and about cameras and microphones and so on."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It's a distributed modeling system, which is very different than the way people have thought about it."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "And so that's a really compelling and interesting idea."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "I have two first questions."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "So one, on the ensemble part of everything coming together, you have these thousand brains."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "How do you know which one has done the best job of forming the... Great question."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Let me try to explain it."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "There's a problem that's known in neuroscience called the sensor fusion problem."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "And so the idea is there's something like, oh, the image comes from the eye."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "There's a picture on the retina and then it gets projected to the neocortex."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Oh, by now it's all spread out all over the place and it's kind of squirrely and distorted and pieces are all over the..."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "It doesn't look like a picture anymore."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "When does it all come back together again?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Or you might say, well, yes, but I also have sounds or touches associated with the cup."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So I'm seeing the cup and touching the cup."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "How do they get combined together again?"}, {"time": 2452, "text": "So it's called the sensor fusion problem."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "As if all these disparate parts have to be brought together into one model someplace."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "That's the wrong idea."}, {"time": 2461,

the size of a little piece of spaghetti."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Like a two and a half millimeters tall and about a millimeter in wide."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "They're not physical, but you could think of them that way."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And each one's trying to guess what this thing is or touching."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Now, they can do a pretty good job if they're allowed to move over time."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "So I can reach my hand into a black box and move my finger around an object."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "And if I touch enough spaces, I go, okay, now I know what it is."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "But often we don't do that."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "Often I can just reach and grab something with my hand all at once and I get it."}, {"time": 2511,

the cortex, are all trying to guess what it is that they're sensing."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "They'll do a better guess if they have time and can move over time."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "So if I move my eyes, I move my fingers."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "But if they don't, they have a poor guess."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "It's a probabilistic guess of what they might be touching."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Now, imagine they can post their probability at the top of a little piece of spaghetti."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "Each one of them says, I think, and it's not really a probability distribution."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "It's more like a set of possibilities."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "In the brain, it doesn't work as a probability distribution."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "It works as more like what we call a union."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "So you could say, and one column says, I think it could be a coffee cup, a soda can, or a water bottle."}, {"time": 2559, "text":

described this in a recent paper and we've modeled this that says, they can all quickly settle on the only or the one best answer for all of them."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "If there is a single best answer, they all vote and say, yep, it's gotta be the coffee cup."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And at that point, they all know it's a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And at that point, everyone acts as if it's a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "They're like, yep, we know it's a coffee, even though I've only seen one little piece of this world, I know it's a coffee cup I'm touching or

all different."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "But this layer that's doing the voting, it solidifies."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "It's just like it crystallizes and says, oh, we all know what we're doing."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "And so you don't bring these models together in one model, you just vote and there's a crystallization of the vote."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Great, that's at least a compelling way to think about the way you form a model of the world."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "Now, you talk about a coffee cup."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "Do you see this, as far as I understand, you are proposing this as well, that this extends to much more than coffee cups?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Or at least the physical world, it expands to the world of concepts."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And well, first, the primary thing is evidence for that is that the regions of the neocortex that are associated with language or high level thought or mathematics or things like that, they look like the regions of the neocortex that process vision, hearing, and touch."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "They don't look any different."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Or they look only marginally different."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "And so one would say, well, if Vernon Mountcastle, who proposed that all the parts of the neocortex do the same thing, if he's right, then the parts that are doing language or mathematics or physics are working on the same principle."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "They must be working on the principle of reference frames."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So that's a little odd thought."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "But of course, we had no prior idea how these things happen."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "So let's go with that."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "And we, in our recent paper, we talked a little bit about that."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "I've been working on it more since."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "I have better ideas about it now."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "I'm sitting here very confident that that's what's happening."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And I can give you some examples that help you think about that."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "It's not we understand it completely, but I understand it better than I've described it in any paper so far."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So, but we did put that idea out there."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "It says, okay, this is, it's a good place to start, you know?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "And the evidence would suggest it's how it's happening."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "And then we can start tackling that problem one piece at a time."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "Like, what does it mean to do high level thought?"}, {"time": 2729, "text": "What does it mean to do language?"}, {"time": 2730, "text": "How would that fit into a reference frame framework?"}, {"time": 2734, "text": "Yeah, so there's a, I don't know if you could tell me if there's a connection, but there's an app called Anki that helps you remember different concepts."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "And they talk about like a memory palace that helps you remember completely random concepts by trying to put them in a physical space in your mind and putting them next to each other."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "It's called the method of loci."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "Loci, yeah."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "For some reason, that seems to work really well."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Now, that's a very narrow kind of application of just remembering some facts."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "But that's a very, very telling one."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "So this seems like you're describing a mechanism why this seems to work."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So basically the way what we think is going on is all things you know, all concepts, all ideas, words, everything you know are stored in reference frames."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And so if you want to remember something, you have to basically navigate through a reference frame the same way a rat navigates through a maze and the same way my finger navigates to this coffee cup."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "You are moving through some space."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And so if you have a random list of things you were asked to remember, by assigning them to a reference frame, you've already know very well to see your house, right?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And the idea of the method of loci is you can say, okay, in my lobby, I'm going to put this thing."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And then the bedroom, I put this one."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "I go down the hall, I put this thing."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And then you want to recall those facts or recall those things."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "You just walk mentally, you walk through your house."}, {"time": 2814,

2820, "text": "It tells us the brain prefers to store things in reference frames."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And that the method of recalling things or thinking, if you will, is to move mentally through those reference frames."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "You could move physically through some reference frames, like I could physically move through the reference frame of this coffee cup."},

2842, "text": "And so now we can ask yourself, or are all concepts stored this way?"}, {"time": 2846, "text": "There was some recent research using human subjects in fMRI, and I'm going to apologize for not knowing the name of the scientists who did this."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "But what they did is they put humans in this fMRI machine, which is one of these imaging machines."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And they gave the humans tasks to think about birds."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So they had different types of birds, and birds that look big and small, and long necks and long legs, things like that."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And what they could tell from the fMRI was a very clever experiment."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "You get to tell when humans were thinking about the birds, that the birds, the knowledge of birds was arranged in a reference frame, similar to the ones that are used when you navigate in a room."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "That these are called grid cells, and there are grid cell like patterns of activity in the neocortex when they do this."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "So it's a very clever experiment."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And what it basically says, that even when you're thinking about something abstract, and you're not really thinking about it as a reference frame, it tells us the brain is actually using a reference frame."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "And it's using the same neural mechanisms."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "These grid cells are the basic same neural mechanism that we propose that grid cells, which exist in the old part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, that that mechanism is now similar mechanism is used throughout the neocortex."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "It's the same nature to preserve this interesting way of creating reference frames."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And so now they have empirical evidence that when you think about concepts like birds, that you're using reference frames that are built on grid cells."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So that's similar to the method of loci, but in this case, the birds are related."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So they create their own reference frame, which is consistent with bird space."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "And when you think about something, you go through that."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "You can make the same example, let's take mathematics."},

haven't proven it."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And so it might be an equation."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "I wanna show that this is equal to that."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "And you have some places you start with."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "You say, well, I know this is true, and I know this is true."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "And I think that maybe to get to the final proof, I need to go through some intermediate results."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "What I believe is happening is literally these equations or these points are assigned to a reference frame, a mathematical reference frame."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "And when you do mathematical operations, a simple one might be multiply or divide, but you might be a little plus transform or something else."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "That is like a movement in the reference frame of the math."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And so you're literally trying to discover a path from one location to another location in a space of mathematics."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And if you can get to these intermediate results, then you know your map is pretty good, and you know you're using the right operations."}, {"time": 3002,

that space to get me there."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "Yeah, so if you dig in an idea of this reference frame, whether it's the math, you start a set of axioms to try to get to proving the conjecture."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Can you try to describe, maybe take a step back, how you think of the reference frame in that context?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "Is it the reference frame that the axioms are happy in?"}, {"time": 3036, "text": "Is it the reference frame that might contain everything?"}, {"time": 3038, "text": "Is it a changing thing as you?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "You have many, many reference frames."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I mean, in fact, the way the theory, the thousand brain theory of intelligence says that every single thing in the world has its own reference frame."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So every word has its own reference frames."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "And we can talk about this."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "The mathematics work out, this is no problem for neurons to do this."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "But how many reference frames does a coffee cup have?"}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Well, it's on a table."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "Let's say you ask how many reference frames could a column in my finger that's touching the coffee cup have?"}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Because there are many, many copy, there are many, many models of the coffee cup."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "So the coffee, there is no one model of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "There are many models of a coffee cup."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "And you could say, well, how many different things can my finger learn?"}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Is this the question you want to ask?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Imagine I say every concept, every idea, everything you've ever know about that you can say, I know that thing has a reference frame associated with it."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "And what we do when we build composite objects, we assign reference frames to point another reference frame."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So my coffee cup has multiple components to it."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "It's got a limb, it's got a cylinder, it's got a handle."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "And those things have their own reference frames and they're assigned to a master reference frame, which is called this cup."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And now I have this Numenta logo on it."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Well, that's something that exists elsewhere in the world."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "It's its own thing."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "So it has its own reference frame."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So we now have to say, how can I assign the Numenta logo reference frame onto the cylinder or onto the coffee cup?"}, {"time": 3119, "text": "So it's all, we talked about this in the paper that came out in December of this last year."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "The idea of how you can assign reference frames to reference frames, how neurons could do this."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "So, well, my question is, even though you mentioned reference frames a lot, I almost feel it's really useful to dig into how you think of what a reference frame is."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "I mean, it was already helpful for me to understand that you think of reference frames as something there is a lot of."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "Okay, so let's

neuroscience in an old part of the brain."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "The way these cells create reference frames, they have no origin."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So what it's more like, you have a

3279, "text": "They seem to know where they are, right?"}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So this is a current area of active research, and it seems like somehow the neurons in the entorhinal cortex can

had a bunch of two dimensional slices."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "That's the way these things work."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "There's a whole bunch of two dimensional models, and you can just, you can slice up any n dimensional space with two dimensional projections."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "So, and you could have one dimensional models."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "So there's nothing inherent about the mathematics about the way the neurons do this, which constrain the dimensionality of the space, which I think was important."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So obviously I have a three

most?"}, {"time": 3458, "text": "Oh, well, right now, this is a detailed thing that wouldn't apply to most people, okay?"}, {"time": 3463, "text": "But you want me to answer that question?"}, {"time": 3466, "text": "We've talked about as if, oh, to predict what you're going to sense on this coffee cup, I need to know where my finger is gonna be on the coffee cup."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "That is

cells, which way the rat is facing."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "It's the same kind of basic idea."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "So if my finger were a rat, you know, in three dimensions, I have a three dimensional orientation and I have a three dimensional location."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "If I was a rat, I would have a, you might think of it as a two dimensional location, a two dimensional orientation, a one dimensional orientation, like just which way is it facing?"}, {"time": 3515, "text": "So how the two components work together, how it is that I combine orientation, the orientation of my sensor, as well as the location is a tricky problem."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "And I think I've made progress on it."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "So at a bigger version of that, so perspective is super interesting, but super specific."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "Yeah, I warned you."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "No, no, no, that's really good, but there's a more general version of that."}, {"time":

the way to think about it is the following, one way to think about it, is we have all these models of the world, okay?"}, {"time": 3604, "text": "And we model everything."}, {"time": 3606, "text":

synapses on it, which is a connection between neurons."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Real neurons can have everywhere from five to 30,000 synapses on them."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "The ones near the

"text": "They're too far away."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "So if you activate one of those synapses, it just doesn't affect the cell body enough to make any difference."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "Any one of them individually."}, {"time": 4010, "text": "Any one of them individually, or even if you do a mass of them."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "What real neurons do is the following."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "If you activate or you get 10 to 20 of them active at the same time, meaning they're all receiving an input at the same time, and those 10 to 20 synapses or 40 synapses within a very short distance on the dendrite, like 40 microns, a very small area."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So if you activate a bunch of these right next to each other at some distant place, what happens is it creates what's called the dendritic spike."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "And the dendritic spike travels through the dendrites and can reach the soma or the cell body."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "Now, when it gets there, it changes the voltage, which is sort of like gonna make the cell fire, but never enough to make the cell fire."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "It's sort of what we call, it says we depolarize the cell, you raise the voltage a little bit, but not enough to do anything."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "It's like, well, what good is that?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "And then it goes back down again."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "So we propose a theory, which I'm very confident in basics are, is that what's happening there is those 95% of the synapses are recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique patterns."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "They can write about 10, 20 synapses at a time, and they're acting like predictions."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "So the neuron actually is a predictive engine on its own."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "It can fire when it gets enough, what they call proximal input from those ones near the cell fire, but it can get ready to fire from dozens to hundreds of patterns that it recognizes from the other guys."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And the advantage of this to the neuron is that when it actually does produce a spike in action potential, it does so slightly sooner than it would have otherwise."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "And so what could is slightly sooner?"}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Well, the slightly sooner part is it, all the excitatory neurons in the brain are surrounded by these inhibitory neurons, and they're very fast, the inhibitory neurons, these basket cells."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "And if I get my spike out a little bit sooner than someone else, I inhibit all my neighbors around me, right?"}, {"time": 4127, "text": "And what you end up with is a different representation."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "You end up with a reputation that matches your prediction."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "It's a sparser representation, meaning fewer neurons are active, but it's much more specific."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And so we showed how networks of these neurons can do very sophisticated temporal prediction, basically."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "So this, summarize this, real neurons in the brain are time based prediction engines, and there's no concept of this at all in artificial, what we call point neurons."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "I don't think you can build a brain without them."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "I don't think you can build intelligence without them, because it's where a large part of the time comes from."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "These are predictive models, and the time is, there's a prior and a prediction and an action, and it's inherent through every neuron in the neocortex."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "So I would say that point neurons sort of model a piece of that, and not very well at that either."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "But like for example, synapses are very unreliable, and you cannot assign any precision to them."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So even one digit of precision is not possible."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "So the way real neurons work is they don't add these, they don't change these weights accurately like artificial neural networks do."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "They basically form new synapses, and so what you're trying to always do is detect the presence of some 10 to 20 active synapses at the same time, as opposed, and they're almost binary."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "It's like, because you can't really represent anything much finer than that."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "So these are the kind of, and I think that's actually another essential component, because the brain works on sparse patterns, and all that mechanism is based on sparse patterns, and I don't actually think you could build real brains or machine intelligence without incorporating some of those ideas."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "It's hard to even think about the complexity that emerges from the fact that the timing of the firing matters in the brain, the fact that you form new synapses, and I mean, everything you just mentioned in the past couple minutes."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Trust me, if you spend time on it, you can get your mind around it."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "It's not like, it's no longer a mystery to me."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "No, but sorry, as a function, in a mathematical way, can you start getting an intuition about what gets it excited, what not, and what kind of representation?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Yeah, it's not as easy as, there's many other types of neural networks that are more amenable to pure analysis, especially very simple networks."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "Oh, I have four neurons, and they're doing this."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "Can we describe to them mathematically what they're doing type of thing?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "Even the complexity of convolutional neural networks today, it's sort of a mystery."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "They can't really describe the whole system."},

if you're interested, talking about sort of the mathematical properties of sparse representations."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And so what we can do is we can show mathematically, for example, why 10 to 20 synapses to recognize a pattern is the correct number, is the right number you'd wanna use."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And by the way, that matches biology."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "We can show mathematically some of these concepts about the show why the brain is so robust to noise and error and fallout and so on."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "We can show that mathematically as well as empirically in simulations."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "But the system can't be analyzed completely."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Any complex system can't, and so that's out of the realm."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "But there is mathematical benefits and intuitions that can be derived from mathematics."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And we try to do that as well."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "Most of our papers have a section about that."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So I think it's refreshing and useful for me to be talking to you about deep neural networks, because your intuition basically says that we can't achieve anything like intelligence with artificial neural networks."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Well, not in the current form."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "Not in the current form."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "I'm sure we can do it in the ultimate form, sure."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So let me dig into it and see what your thoughts are there a little bit."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "So I'm not sure if you read this little blog post called Bitter Lesson by Rich Sutton recently."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "He's a reinforcement learning pioneer."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar with him."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "His basic idea is that all the stuff we've done in AI in the past 70 years, he's one of the old school guys."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "The biggest

system, if we're talking about, he's not concerned about intelligence."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "He's concerned about a system that works in terms of making predictions on applied narrow AI problems, right?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "That's what this discussion is about."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "That you just try to go as general as possible and wait years or decades for the computation to make it actually."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Is he saying that as a criticism or is he saying this is a prescription of what we ought to be doing?"}, {"time": 4434, "text": "Well, it's very difficult."},

do."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "He's part of the community."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "He's saying it's only going to be short term gains."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So this all leads up to a question,

just feels like if the fewer neurons are involved, the more fragile the representation."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "But I didn't say there was lots of few neurons."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "I said, let's say 200."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "That's a lot."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "There's still a lot, it's just."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "So here's an intuition for it."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "This is a bit technical, so for engineers, machine learning people, this will be easy, but all the listeners, maybe not."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "If you're trying to classify something, you're trying to divide some very high dimensional space into different pieces, A and B."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "And you're trying to create some point where you say, all these points in this high dimensional space are A, and all these points in this high dimensional space are B."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "And if you have points that are close to that line, it's not very robust."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "It works for all the points you know about, but it's not very robust, because you can just move a little bit and you've crossed over the line."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "When you have sparse representations, imagine I pick, I'm gonna pick 200 cells active out of 10,000, okay?"}, {"time": 4879, "text": "So I have 200 cells active."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "Now let's say I pick randomly another, a different representation, 200."}, {"time": 4884, "text": "The overlap between those is gonna be very small, just a few."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "I can pick millions of samples randomly of 200 neurons, and not one of them will overlap more than just a few."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "So one way to think about it is, if I wanna fool one of these representations to look like one of those other representations, I can't move just one cell, or two cells, or three cells, or four cells."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "I have to move 100 cells."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "And that makes them robust."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "In terms of further, so you mentioned sparsity."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "What would be the next thing?"}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Okay, so we have, we picked one."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "We don't know if it's gonna work well yet."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "So again, we're trying to come up with incremental ways to moving from brain theory to add pieces to machine learning, current machine learning world, and one step at a time."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "So the next thing we're gonna try to do is sort of incorporate some of the ideas of the thousand brains theory, that you have many, many models that are voting."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Now that idea is not new."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "There's a mixture of models that's been around for a long time."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "But the way the brain does it is a little different."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And the way it votes is different."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And the kind of way it represents uncertainty is different."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "So we're just starting this work, but we're gonna try to see if we can sort of incorporate some of the principles of voting, or principles of the thousand brain theory."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Like lots of simple models that talk to each other in a certain way."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "And can we build more machines, systems that learn faster and also, well mostly are multimodal and robust to multimodal type of issues."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "So one of the challenges there is the machine learning computer vision community has certain sets of benchmarks, sets of tests based on which they compete."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "And I would argue, especially from your perspective, that those benchmarks aren't that useful for testing the aspects that the brain is good at, or intelligence."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "They're not really testing intelligence."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "They're very fine."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "And it's been extremely useful for developing specific mathematical models, but it's not useful in the long term for creating intelligence."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So you think you also have a role in proposing better tests?"}, {"time": 5027, "text": "Yeah, this is a very, you've identified a very serious problem."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "First of all, the tests that they have are the tests that they want."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Not the tests of the other things that we're trying to do, right?"}, {"time": 5038, "text": "You know, what are the, so on."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "The second thing is sometimes these, to be competitive in these tests, you have to have huge data sets and huge computing power."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "And so, you know, and we don't have that here."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "We don't have it as well as other big teams that big companies do."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "So there's numerous issues there."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "You know, we come out, you know, where our approach to this is all based on, in some sense, you might argue, elegance."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "We're coming at it from like a theoretical base that we think, oh my God, this is so clearly elegant."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "This is how brains work."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "This is what intelligence is."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "But the machine learning world has gotten in this phase where they think it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "Doesn't matter what you think, as long as you do, you know, 0.1% better on this benchmark, that's what, that's all that matters."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "And that's a problem."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "You know, we have to figure out how to get around that."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "That's a challenge for us."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "That's one of the challenges that we have to deal with."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So I agree, you've identified a big issue."},

people to say, I'm gonna read those papers."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "Those might be some interesting ideas."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "I'm tired of doing this 0.1% improvement stuff, you know?"}, {"time": 5108, "text": "Well, that's why I'm here as well, because I think machine learning now as a community is at a place where the next step needs to be orthogonal to what has received success in the past."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Well, you see other leaders saying this, machine learning leaders, you know, Jeff Hinton with his capsules idea."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "Many people have gotten up to say, you know, we're gonna hit road map, maybe we should look at the brain, you know, things like that."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "So hopefully that thinking will occur organically."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And then we're in a nice position for people to come and look at our work and say, well, what can we learn from these guys?"}, {"time": 5143, "text": "Yeah, MIT is launching a billion dollar computing college that's centered around this idea, so."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "Is it on this idea of what?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "Well, the idea that, you know, the humanities,

Let's study what a brain does."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Does."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "And then we can decide which parts of that we wanna recreate in some system, but until you have that theory about what the brain does, what's the point, you know, it's just, you're gonna be wasting time, I think."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Right, just to break it down on the artificial neural network side, maybe you could speak to this on the biological neural network side, the process of learning versus the process of inference."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "Maybe you can explain to me, is there a difference between, you know, in artificial neural networks, there's a difference between the learning stage and the inference stage."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "Do you see the brain as something different?"}, {"time": 5244, "text": "One of the big distinctions that people often say, I don't know how correct it is, is artificial neural networks need a lot of data."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "They're very inefficient learning."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "Do you see that as a correct distinction from the biology of the human brain, that the human brain is very efficient, or is that just something we deceive ourselves?"}, {"time": 5264, "text": "No, it is efficient, obviously."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "We can learn new things almost instantly."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "And so what elements do you think are useful?"}, {"time": 5270, "text": "Yeah, I can talk about that."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "You brought up two issues there."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "So remember I talked early about the constraints we always feel, well, one of those constraints is the fact that brains are continually learning."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "That's not something we said, oh, we can add that later."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "That's something that was upfront, had to be there from the start, made our problems harder."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "But we showed, going back to the 2016 paper on sequence memory, we showed how that happens, how the brains infer and learn at the same time."}, {"time": 5299, "text": "And our models do that."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "And they're not two separate phases, or two separate sets of time."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "I think that's a big, big problem in AI, at least for many applications, not for all."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "So I can talk about that."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "There are some, it gets detailed, there are some parts of the neocortex in the brain where actually what's going on, there's these cycles of activity in the brain."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And there's very strong evidence that you're doing more of inference on one part of the phase, and more of learning on the other part of the phase."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "So the brain can actually sort of separate different populations of cells or going back and forth like this."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "But in general, I would say that's an important problem."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "We have all of our networks that we've come up with do both."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "And they're continuous learning networks."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "And you mentioned benchmarks earlier."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "Well, there are no benchmarks about that."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "So we have to, we get in our little soapbox, and hey, by the way, this is important, and here's a mechanism for doing that."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "But until you can prove it to someone in some commercial system or something, it's a little harder."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "So yeah, one of the things I had to linger on that is in some ways to learn the concept of a coffee cup, you only need this one coffee cup and maybe some time alone in a room with it."},

something I already know or if it's a new thing."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "And I have to, I'm doing both at the same time."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "I don't say, oh, let's see if it's a new thing."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "Oh, let's see if it's an old thing."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "I don't do that."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "As I go, my brain says, oh, it's new or it's not new."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And if it's new, I start learning what it is."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "And by the way, it starts learning from the get go, even if it's gonna recognize it."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "So they're not separate problems."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "And so that's the thing there."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "The other thing you mentioned was the fast learning."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "So I was just talking about continuous learning, but there's also fast learning."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "Literally, I can show you this coffee cup and I say, here's a new coffee cup."},

different positions."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "So I can talk about that too."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "In the brain, the way learning occurs, I mentioned this earlier, but I'll mention it again."},

5444, "text": "I'm just gonna learn something new."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "I need to recognize a new pattern."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna form new synapses."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "New synapses, we're gonna rewire the brain onto that section of the dendrite."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "Once I've done that, everything else that neuron has learned is not affected by it."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "That's because it's isolated to that small section of the dendrite."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "They're not all being added together, like a point neuron."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "So if I learn something new on this segment here, it doesn't change any of the learning that occur anywhere else in that neuron."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "So I can add something without affecting previous learning."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "And I can do it quickly."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "Now let's talk, we can talk about the quickness, how it's done in real neurons."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "You might say, well, doesn't it take time to form synapses?"}, {"time": 5486, "text": "Yes, it can take maybe an hour to form a new synapse."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "We can form memories quicker than that, and I can explain that how it happens too, if you want."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "But it's getting a bit neurosciencey."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "That's great, but is there an understanding of these mechanisms at every level?"}, {"time": 5503, "text": "So from the short term memories and the forming."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So this idea of synaptogenesis, the growth of new synapses, that's well described, it's well understood."}, {"time": 5514, "text": "And that's an essential part of learning."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "That is learning."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Going back many, many years, people, you know, it was, what's his name, the psychologist who proposed, Hebb, Donald Hebb."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "He proposed that learning was the modification of the strength of a connection between two neurons."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "People interpreted that as the modification of the strength of a synapse."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "He didn't say that."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "He just said there's a modification between the effect of one neuron and another."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "So synaptogenesis is totally consistent with what Donald Hebb said."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "But anyway, there's these mechanisms, the growth of new synapses."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "You can go online, you can watch a video of a synapse growing in real time."}, {"time": 5553, "text": "It's literally, you can see this little thing going boop."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "It's pretty impressive."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "So those mechanisms are known."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "Now there's another thing that we've speculated and we've written about, which is consistent with known neuroscience, but it's less proven."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "And this is the idea, how do I form a memory really, really quickly?"}, {"time": 5571, "text": "Like instantaneous."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "If it takes an hour to grow a synapse, like that's not instantaneous."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "So there are types of synapses called silent synapses."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "They look like a synapse, but they don't do anything."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "They're just sitting there."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "It's like if an action potential comes in, it doesn't release any neurotransmitter."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "Some parts of the brain have more of these than others."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "For example, the hippocampus has a lot of them, which is where we associate most short term memory with."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "So what we speculated, again, in that 2016 paper, we proposed that the way we form very quick memories, very short term memories, or quick memories, is that we convert silent synapses into active synapses."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "It's like saying a synapse has a zero weight and a one weight, but the longterm memory has to be formed by synaptogenesis."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "So you can remember something really quickly by just flipping a bunch of these guys from silent to active."}, {"time": 5626, "text": "It's not from 0.1 to 0.15."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "It's like, it doesn't do anything till it releases transmitter."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And if I do that over a bunch of these, I've got a very quick short term memory."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "So I guess the lesson behind this is that most neural networks today are fully connected."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "Every neuron connects every other neuron from layer to layer."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "That's not correct in the brain."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "We don't want that."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "We actually don't want that."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "You want a very sparse connectivity so that any neuron connects to some subset of the neurons in the other layer."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "And it does so on a dendrite by dendrite segment basis."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "So it's a very some parcelated out type of thing."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "And that then learning is not adjusting all these weights, but learning is just saying, okay, connect to these 10 cells here right now."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "In that process, you know, with artificial neural networks, it's a very simple process of backpropagation that adjusts the weights."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "The process of synaptogenesis."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "It's even easier."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "Backpropagation requires something that really can't happen in brains."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "This backpropagation of this error signal, that really can't happen."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "People are trying to make it happen in brains, but it doesn't happen in brains."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "This is pure Hebbian learning."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Well, synaptogenesis is pure Hebbian learning."}, {"time": 5698, "text": "It's basically saying, there's a population of cells over here that are active right now."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "And there's a population of cells over here active right now."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "How do I form connections between those active cells?"}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And it's literally saying this guy became active."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "These 100 neurons here became active before this neuron became active."}, {"time": 5715,

almost completely on Hebbian learning, but on dendritic segments and multiple synapses at the same time."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So now let's sort of turn the question that you already answered, and maybe you can answer it again."}, {"time": 5738, "text": "If you look at the history of artificial intelligence, where do you think we stand?"}, {"time": 5743, "text": "How far are we from solving intelligence?"}, {"time": 5745, "text": "You said you were very optimistic."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Can you elaborate on that?"}, {"time": 5748, "text": "Yeah, it's always the crazy question to ask because no one can predict the future."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "So I'll tell you a story."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "I used to run a different neuroscience institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, and we would hold these symposiums and we'd get like 35 scientists from around the world to come together."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "And I used to ask them all the same question."},

introduced the name and they have to answer that question."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "So I got, the typical answer was 50 to 100 years."}, {"time": 5782, "text": "Some people would say 500 years."},

happen."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "You can't predict that."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "I feel I've already passed a step function."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "So if I can do my job correctly over the

year span."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "It'll be something like that."}, {"time": 5848, "text": "But I think if I can do what I said, we're starting it."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "And of course there could be other, you said step functions."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "It could be everybody gives up on your ideas for 20 years and then all of a sudden somebody picks it up again."}, {"time": 5862,

one, just in your intuition about intelligence, when you think about intelligence of us humans, do you think of that as something, if you look at intelligence on a spectrum from zero to us humans, do
