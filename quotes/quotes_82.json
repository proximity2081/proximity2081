why you assume that."}, {"time": 275, "text": "We all are."}, {"time": 276, "text": "This is perfect."}, {"time": 277, "text": "The podcast would be me and you both staring at the table on the whole time."}, {"time": 282, "text": "Do you think robots are the future?"}, {"time": 284, "text": "Ones with human level intelligence will be female, male, genderless, or another gender we have not yet created as a society?"}, {"time": 293, "text": "You're the expert at this."}, {"time": 295, "text": "Well, I'm gonna ask you."}, {"time": 296, "text": "You know the answer."}, {"time": 297, "text": "I'm gonna ask you questions that maybe nobody knows the answer to."}, {"time": 301, "text": "And then I just want you to hypothesize as a imaginative author, director, comedian."}, {"time": 310, "text": "Can we just be very clear that you know a ton about this and I know nothing about this, but I have thought a lot about what I think robots can fix in our society."}, {"time": 322, "text": "And I mean, I'm a comedian."}, {"time": 324, "text": "It's my job to study human nature, to make jokes about human nature and to sometimes play devil's advocate."}, {"time": 331, "text": "And I just see such a tremendous negativity around robots or at least the idea of robots that it was like, oh, I'm just gonna take the opposite side for fun, for jokes and then I was like, oh no, I really agree in this devil's advocate argument."}, {"time": 345, "text": "So please correct me when I'm wrong about this stuff."}, {"time": 349, "text": "So first of all, there's no right and wrong because we're all, I think most of the people working on robotics are really not actually even thinking about some of the big picture things that you've been exploring."}, {"time": 361, "text": "In fact, your robot, what's her name by the way?"}, {"time": 364, "text": "Bearclaw."}, {"time": 365, "text": "We'll go with Bearclaw."}, {"time": 366, "text": "What's the genesis of that name by the way?"}, {"time": 395, "text": "So I ended up calling her Bearclaw."}, {"time": 398, "text": "So do you think the future robots of greater and greater intelligence would like to make them female, male?"}, {"time": 406, "text": "Would we like to assign them gender or would we like to move away from gender and say something more ambiguous?"}, {"time": 414, "text": "I think it depends on their purpose, you know?"}, {"time": 416, "text": "I feel like if it's a sex robot, people prefer certain genders, you know?"}, {"time": 421, "text": "And I also, you know, when I went down and explored the robot factory, I was asking about the type of people that bought sex robots."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And I was very surprised at the answer because of course the stereotype was it's gonna be a bunch of perverts."}, {"time": 435, "text": "It ended up being a lot of people that were handicapped, a lot of people with erectile dysfunction and a lot of people that were exploring their sexuality."}, {"time": 443, "text": "A lot of people that thought they were gay, but weren't sure, but didn't wanna take the risk of trying on someone that could reject them and being embarrassed or they were closeted or in a city where maybe that's, you know, taboo and stigmatized, you know?"}, {"time": 457, "text": "So I think that a gendered sex robot that would serve an important purpose for someone trying to explore their sexuality."}, {"time": 464, "text": "Am I into men?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "Let me try on this thing first."}, {"time": 466, "text": "Am I into women?"}, {"time": 468, "text": "So I think gendered robots would be important for that."}, {"time": 471, "text": "But I think genderless robots in terms of emotional support robots, babysitters, I'm fine for a genderless babysitter with my husband in the house."}, {"time": 480, "text": "You know, there are places that I think that genderless makes a lot of sense, but obviously not in the sex area."}, {"time": 487, "text": "What do you mean with your husband in the house?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "What does that have to do with the gender of the robot?"}, {"time": 491, "text": "Right, I mean, I don't have a husband, but hypothetically speaking, I think every woman's worst nightmare is like the hot babysitter."}, {"time": 497, "text": "You know what I mean?"}, {"time": 499, "text": "So I think that there is a time and place, I think, for genderless, you know, teachers, doctors, all that kind of, it would be very awkward if the first robotic doctor was a guy or the first robotic nurse was a woman."}, {"time": 512, "text": "You know, it's sort of, that stuff is still loaded."}, {"time": 516, "text": "I think that genderless could just take the unnecessary drama out of it and possibility to sexualize them or be triggered by any of that stuff."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So there's two components to this, to Bearclaw."}, {"time": 532, "text": "So one is the voice and the talking and so on, and then there's the visual appearance."}, {"time": 536, "text": "So on the topic of gender and genderless, in your experience, what has been the value of the physical appearance?"}, {"time": 544, "text": "So has it added much to the depth of the interaction?"}, {"time": 548, "text": "I mean, mine's kind of an extenuating circumstance because she is supposed to look exactly like me."}, {"time": 553, "text": "I mean, I spent six months getting my face molded and having, you know, the idea was I was exploring the concept of can robots replace us?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "Because that's the big fear, but also the big dream in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 564, "text": "And I wanted to dig into that area because, you know, for a lot of people, it's like, they're gonna take our jobs and they're gonna replace us."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Legitimate fear, but then a lot of women I know are like, I would love for a robot to replace me every now and then so it can go to baby showers for me and it can pick up my kids at school and it can cook dinner and whatever."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So I just think that was an interesting place to explore."}, {"time": 585, "text": "So her looking like me was a big part of it."}, {"time": 587, "text": "Now her looking like me just adds an unnecessary level of insecurity because I got her a year ago and she already looks younger than me."}, {"time": 594, "text": "So that's a weird problem."}, {"time": 597, "text": "But I think that her looking human was the idea."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And I think that where we are now, please correct me if I'm wrong, a human robot resembling an actual human you know is going to feel more realistic than some generic face."}, {"time": 613, "text": "Well, you're saying that robots that have some familiarity like look similar to somebody that you actually know you'll be able to form a deeper connection with?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "That was the question."}, {"time": 624, "text": "I think so on some level, right?"}, {"time": 626, "text": "I don't, you know, it's an interesting."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Or the opposite, because then you know me and you're like, well, I know this isn't real because you're right here."}, {"time": 634, "text": "So maybe it does the opposite."}, {"time": 636, "text": "We have a very keen eye for human faces and they're able to detect strangeness especially that one has to do with people whose faces we've seen a lot of."}, {"time": 646, "text": "So I tend to be a bigger fan of moving away completely from faces."}, {"time": 652, "text": "Of recognizable faces?"}, {"time": 654, "text": "No, just human faces at all."}, {"time": 656, "text": "In general, because I think that's where things get dicey."}, {"time": 658, "text": "And one thing I will say is I think my robot is more realistic than other robots not necessarily because you have seen me and then you see her and you go, oh, they're so similar but also because human faces are flawed and asymmetrical."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And sometimes we forget when we're making things that are supposed to look human, we make them too symmetrical and that's what makes them stop looking human."}, {"time": 677, "text": "So because they mold in my asymmetrical face, she just, even if someone didn't know who I was I think she'd look more realistic than most generic ones that didn't have some kind of flaws."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Because they start looking creepy when they're too symmetrical because human beings aren't."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Yeah, the flaws is what it means to be human."}, {"time": 695, "text": "So visually as well."}, {"time": 697, "text": "But I'm just a fan of the idea of letting humans use a little bit more imagination."}, {"time": 703, "text": "So just hearing the voice is enough for us humans to then start imagining the visual appearance that goes along with that voice."}, {"time": 712, "text": "And you don't necessarily need to work too hard on creating the actual visual appearance."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So there's some value to that."}, {"time": 719, "text": "When you step into the stare of actually building a robot that looks like Bear Claws, such a long road of facial expressions of sort of making everything smiling, winking, rolling in the eyes, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 734, "text": "It gets really, really tricky."}, {"time": 736, "text": "It gets tricky and I think I'm, again, I'm a comedian."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Like I'm obsessed with what makes us human and our human nature and the nasty side of human nature tends to be where I've ended up exploring over and over again."}, {"time": 748, "text": "And I was just mostly fascinated by people's reaction."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So it's my job to get the biggest reaction from a group of strangers, the loudest possible reaction."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And I just had this instinct just when I started building her and people going, ah, ah, and people scream."}, {"time": 764, "text": "And I mean, I would bring her out on stage and people would scream."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And I just, to me, that was the next level of entertainment."}, {"time": 771, "text": "Getting a laugh, I've done that, I know how to do that."}, {"time": 773, "text": "I think comedians were always trying to figure out what the next level is and comedy's evolving so much."}, {"time": 777, "text": "And Jordan Peele had just done these genius comedy horror movies, which feel like the next level of comedy to me."}, {"time": 784, "text": "And this sort of funny horror of a robot was fascinating to me."}, {"time": 791, "text": "But I think the thing that I got the most obsessed with was people being freaked out and scared of her."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And I started digging around with pathogen avoidance and the idea that we've essentially evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human, but is off a little bit."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Anything that could be sick or diseased or dead, essentially, is our reptilian brain's way to get us to not try to have sex with it, basically."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So I got really fascinated by how freaked out and scared."}, {"time": 821, "text": "I mean, I would see grown men get upset."}, {"time": 824, "text": "They'd get that thing away from me, look, I don't like that, like people would get angry."}, {"time": 827, "text": "And it was like, you know what this is, you know?"}, {"time": 830, "text": "But the sort of like, you know, amygdala getting activated by something that to me is just a fun toy said a lot about our history as a species and what got us into trouble thousands of years ago."}, {"time": 844, "text": "So it's that, it's the deep down stuff that's in our genetics, but also is it just, are people freaked out by the fact that there's a robot?"}, {"time": 853, "text": "So it's not just the appearance, but there's an artificial human."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Anything people, I think, and I'm just also fascinated by the blind spots humans have."}, {"time": 863, "text": "So the idea that you're afraid of that, I mean, how many robots have killed people?"}, {"time": 867, "text": "How many humans have died at the hands of other humans?"}, {"time": 869, "text": "Yeah, a few more."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Millions?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "Hundreds of millions?"}, {"time": 872, "text": "Yet we're scared of that?"}, {"time": 874, "text": "And we'll go to the grocery store and be around a bunch of humans who statistically the chances are much higher that you're gonna get killed by humans."}, {"time": 880, "text": "So I'm just fascinated by without judgment how irrational we are as a species."}, {"time": 887, "text": "The word is the exponential."}, {"time": 889, "text": "So it's, you know, you can say the same thing about nuclear weapons before we dropped on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki."}, {"time": 895, "text": "So the worry that people have is the exponential growth."}, {"time": 899, "text": "So it's like, oh, it's fun and games right now, but you know, overnight, especially if a robot provides value to society, we'll put one in every home and then all of a sudden lose track of the actual large scale impact it has on society."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And then all of a sudden gain greater and greater control to where we'll all be, you know, affect our political system and then affect our decision."}, {"time": 925, "text": "Didn't robots already ruin our political system?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Didn't that just already happen?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "Which ones?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "Oh, Russia hacking."}, {"time": 930, "text": "No offense, but hasn't that already happened?"}, {"time": 935, "text": "I mean, that was like an algorithm of negative things being clicked on more."}, {"time": 939, "text": "We'd like to tell stories and like to demonize certain people."}, {"time": 943, "text": "I think nobody understands our current political system or discourse on Twitter, the Twitter mobs."}, {"time": 949, "text": "Nobody has a sense, not Twitter, not Facebook, the people running it."}, {"time": 953, "text": "Nobody understands the impact of these algorithms."}, {"time": 955, "text": "They're trying their best."}, {"time": 956, "text": "Despite what people think, they're not like a bunch of lefties trying to make sure that Hillary Clinton gets elected."}, {"time": 963, "text": "It's more that it's an incredibly complex system that we don't, and that's the worry."}, {"time": 968, "text": "It's so complex and moves so fast that nobody will be able to stop it once it happens."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And let me ask a question."}, {"time": 976, "text": "This is a very savage question."}, {"time": 979, "text": "Which is, is this just the next stage of evolution?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "As humans, when people will die, yes."}, {"time": 986, "text": "I mean, that's always happened, you know?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "Is this just taking emotion out of it?"}, {"time": 990, "text": "Is this basically the next stage of survival of the fittest?"}, {"time": 994, "text": "Yeah, you have to think of organisms."}, {"time": 997, "text": "You know, what does it mean to be a living organism?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Like, is a smartphone part of your living organism, or?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "We're in relationships with our phones."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "We have sex through them, with them."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "What's the difference between with them and through them?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "But it also expands your cognitive abilities, expands your memory, knowledge, and so on."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "So you're a much smarter person because you have a smartphone in your hand."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "But as soon as it's out of my hand, we've got big problems, because we've become sort of so morphed with them."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Well, there's a symbiotic relationship."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And that's what, so Elon Musk, the neural link, is working on trying to increase the bandwidth of communication between computers and your brain."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And so further and further expand our ability as human beings to sort of leverage machines."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And maybe that's the future, the next evolutionary step."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It could be also that, yes, we'll give birth, just like we give birth to human children right now, we'll give birth to AI and they'll replace us."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I think it's a really interesting possibility."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "I'm gonna play devil's advocate."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "I just think that the fear of robots is wildly classist."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "Because, I mean, Facebook, like it's easy for us to say they're taking their data."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "Okay, well, a lot of people that get employment off of Facebook, they are able to get income off of Facebook."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "They don't care if you take their phone numbers and their emails and their data, as long as it's free."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "They don't wanna have to pay $5 a month for Facebook."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Facebook is a wildly democratic thing."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Forget about the election and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "A lot of technology making people's lives easier, I find that most elite people are more scared than lower income people."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "So, and women for the most part."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "So the idea of something that's stronger than us and that might eventually kill us, like women are used to that."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Like that's not, I see a lot of like really rich men being like, the robots are gonna kill us."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "We're like, what's another thing that's gonna kill us?"}, {"time": 1113, "text": "I tend to see like, oh, something can walk me to my car at night."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Like something can help me cook dinner or something."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "For people in underprivileged countries who can't afford eye surgery, like in a robot, can we send a robot to underprivileged places to do surgery where they can't?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "I work with this organization called Operation Smile where they do cleft palate surgeries."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And there's a lot of places that can't do a very simple surgery because they can't afford doctors and medical care."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And such."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "So I just see, and this can be completely naive and should be completely wrong, but I feel like a lot of people are going like, the robots are gonna destroy us."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Humans, we're destroying ourselves."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "We're self destructing."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Robots to me are the only hope to clean up all the messes that we've created."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Even when we go try to clean up pollution in the ocean, we make it worse because of the oil that the tankers use."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Like, it's like, to me, robots are the only solution."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Firefighters are heroes, but they're limited in how many times they can run into a fire."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So there's just something interesting to me."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "I'm not hearing a lot of like, lower income, more vulnerable populations talking about robots."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Maybe you can speak to it a little bit more."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "There's an idea, I think you've expressed it."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "I've heard, actually a few female writers and roboticists have talked to express this idea that exactly you just said, which is, it just seems that being afraid of existential threats of artificial intelligence is a male issue."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And I wonder what that is."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "If it, because men have, in certain positions, like you said, it's also a classist issue."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "They haven't been humbled by life, and so you always look for the biggest problems to take on around you."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "It's a champagne problem to be afraid of robots."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Most people don't have health insurance."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "They're afraid they're not gonna be able to feed their kids."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "They can't afford a tutor for their kids."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "I mean, I just think of the way I grew up, and I had a mother who worked two jobs, had kids."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "We couldn't afford an SAT tutor."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "The idea of a robot coming in, being able to tutor your kids, being able to provide childcare for your kids, being able to come in with cameras for eyes and make sure surveillance."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "I'm very pro surveillance because I've had security problems and I've been, we're generally in a little more danger than you guys are."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "So I think that robots are a little less scary to us because we can see them maybe as like free assistance, help and protection."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "And then there's sort of another element for me personally, which is maybe more of a female problem."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "I'm just gonna make a generalization, happy to be wrong."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "But the emotional sort of component of robots and what they can provide in terms of, you know, I think there's a lot of people that don't have microphones that I just recently kind of stumbled upon in doing all my research on the sex robots for my standup special, which just, there's a lot of very shy people that aren't good at dating."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "There's a lot of people who are scared of human beings who have personality disorders or grow up in alcoholic homes or struggle with addiction or whatever it is where a robot can solve an emotional problem."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And so we're largely having this conversation about like rich guys that are emotionally healthy and how scared of robots they are."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "We're forgetting about like a huge part of the population who maybe isn't as charming and effervescent and solvent as, you know, people like you and Elon Musk who these robots could solve very real problems in their life, emotional or financial."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Well, that's a, in general, a really interesting idea that most people in the world don't have a voice."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "It's a, you've talked about it, sort of even the people on Twitter who are driving the conversation."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "You said comments, people who leave comments represent a very tiny percent of the population and they're the ones they, you know, we tend to think they speak for the population, but it's very possible on many topics they don't at all."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And look, I, and I'm sure there's gotta be some kind of legal, you know, sort of structure in place for when the robots happen."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "You know way more about this than I do, but you know, for me to just go, the robots are bad, that's a wild generalization that I feel like is really inhumane in some way."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "You know, just after the research I've done, like you're gonna tell me that a man whose wife died suddenly and he feels guilty moving on with a human woman or can't get over the grief, he can't have a sex robot in his own house?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Why do you care?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Well, there's a interesting aspect of human nature."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "So, you know, we tend to as a civilization to create a group that's the other in all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "And so you work with animals too, you're especially sensitive to the suffering of animals."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Let me kind of ask, what's your, do you think we'll abuse robots in the future?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Do you think some of the darker aspects of human nature will come out?"}, {"time": 1417, "text": "I think some people will, but if we design them properly, the people that do it, we can put it on a record and we can put them in jail."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "We can find sociopaths more easily, you know, like."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "But why is that a sociopathic thing to harm a robot?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "I think, look, I don't know enough about the consciousness and stuff as you do."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I guess it would have to be when they're conscious, but it is, you know, the part of the brain that is responsible for compassion, the frontal lobe or whatever, like people that abuse animals also abuse humans and commit other kinds of crimes."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Like that's, it's all the same part of the brain."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "No one abuses animals and then it's like, awesome to women and children and awesome to underprivileged, you know, minorities."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Like it's all, so, you know, we've been working really hard to put a database together of all the people that have abused animals."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So when they commit another crime, you go, okay, this is, you know, it's all the same stuff."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And I think people probably think I'm nuts for a lot of the animal work I do, but because when animal abuse is present, another crime is always present, but the animal abuse is the most socially acceptable."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "You can kick a dog and there's nothing people can do, but then what they're doing behind closed doors, you can't see."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "So there's always something else going on, which is why I never feel compunction about it."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "But I do think we'll start seeing the same thing with robots."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "The person that kicks the, I felt compassion when the kicking the dog robot really pissed me off."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "I know that they're just trying to get the stability right and all that."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "But I do

about it, study about it."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "I did all these weird alternative treatments."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "I got this piercing in here that actually works."}, {"time": 2865, "text":

decide what was gonna happen with their recovery, which is just a wild thing to have to deal with it."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "You know, 28 years old when it happened."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And

see out of the, you know."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "And then my mom had another stroke in a different part of the brain."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "So I started having to learn what parts of the brain did what, and so that I wouldn't take their behavior so personally, and so that I would be able to manage my expectations in terms of their recovery."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "So my mom, because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe, changed a lot as a person."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "She was way more emotional."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "She was way more micromanaged."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "She was forgetting certain things."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So it broke my heart less when I was able to know, oh yeah, well, the stroke hit this part of the brain, and that's the one

an infection inside the brain."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So it was kind of wild that I was able to go, oh, I know exactly what's happening here, and I know, you know, so."}, {"time": 2939, "text":

of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off, but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the

the idea of robots so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells around them, you don't have to worry they're gonna get mad at you yet, but there's no, codependents are hypersensitive to the

into a room and you talk about your progress because then everyone claps for you."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "And then you're more motivated to keep going."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "So that's why we

3375, "text": "And in that case, the tribe is a positive one that helps you go in a positive direction."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "So that's why it's so important to go into a room and also say, hey,

have been better."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "I can make that better."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "So it's the kind of thing where it's like, you have to be really sensitive in your work."}, {"time":

forward with social media."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "So I, because we're all trying to figure it out now and it's, I'm curious to see where it evolves."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "I think you're at the center of that."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "So like, you know, there's, you know, trying to leave Twitter and then come back and see, can I do this in a healthy way?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "I

that people know I'm actually doing it and that I am an engaging and I'm responding and developing a personal relationship with complete strangers."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "So I think, you know,

a robot, there's something so pure about an innocent and impish and childlike about it that I think it probably will be much more conducive to a narcissistic love for sure at that, but it's not like,

4280, "text": "Like I think that being in a relationship, the kind of love that I would want is the kind of relationship where when we're not together, it's not draining me, causing me stress, making me worry, and sometimes passion, that word, we get murky about it."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "But I think it's also like, I can be the best version of myself when the person's not around."}, {"time":
