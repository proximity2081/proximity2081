design."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And so he didn't publish for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own ideas."}, {"time": 395, "text": "He didn't think they could possibly be true."}, {"time": 400, "text": "But then, you know, by the time the 20th century rolls around, we all, you know, we understand that, many people understand or believe that evolution produced, you know, the entire range of animals that there are."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And, you know, Descartes's idea starts to seem a little wonky after a while, right?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "Like, well, wait a minute."}, {"time": 431, "text": "There's the apes and the chimpanzees and the bonobos and, you know, like, they're pretty smart in some ways."}, {"time": 438, "text": "You know, so what?"}, {"time": 440, "text": "Oh, you know, somebody comes up, oh, there's a certain part of the brain that's still different."}, {"time": 444, "text": "They don't, you know, there's no hippocampus in the monkey brain."}, {"time": 448, "text": "It's only in the human brain."}, {"time": 451, "text": "Huxley had to do a surgery in front of many, many people in the late 19th century to show to them there's actually a hippocampus in the chimpanzee's brain."}, {"time": 460, "text": "You know, so the continuity of the species is another element that, you know, contributes to this sort of, you know, idea that we are ourselves a total product of nature."}, {"time": 481, "text": "And that, to me, is the magic and the mystery, how nature could actually, you know, give rise to organisms that have the capabilities that we have."}, {"time": 500, "text": "So it's interesting because even the idea of evolution is hard for me to keep all together in my mind."}, {"time": 507, "text": "So because we think of a human time scale, it's hard to imagine, like, the development of the human eye would give me nightmares too."}, {"time": 516, "text": "Because you have to think across many, many, many generations, and it's very tempting to think about kind of a growth of a complicated object and it's like, how is it possible for such a thing to be built?"}, {"time": 530, "text": "Because also, me, from a robotics engineering perspective, it's very hard to build these systems."}, {"time": 535, "text": "How can, through an undirected process, can a complex thing be designed?"}, {"time": 540, "text": "It seems not, it seems wrong."}, {"time": 543, "text": "Yeah, so that's absolutely right."}, {"time": 545, "text": "And I, you know, a slightly different career path that would have been equally interesting to me would have been to actually study the process of embryological development flowing on into brain development and the exquisite sort of laying down of pathways and so on that occurs in the brain."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And I know the slightest bit about that is not my field, but there are, you know, fascinating aspects to this process that eventually result in the, you know, the complexity of various brains."}, {"time": 594, "text": "At least, you know, one thing we're, in the field, I think people have felt for a long time, in the study of vision, the continuity between humans and nonhuman animals has been second nature for a lot longer."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I was having, I had this conversation with somebody who is a vision scientist and he was saying, oh, we don't have any problem with this."}, {"time": 619, "text": "You know, the monkey's visual system and the human visual system, extremely similar up to certain levels, of course, they diverge after a while."}, {"time": 629, "text": "But the first, the visual pathway from the eye to the brain and the first few layers of cortex or cortical areas, I guess one would say, are extremely similar."}, {"time": 649, "text": "Yeah, so on the cognition side is where the leap seems to happen with humans, that it does seem we're kind of special."}, {"time": 656, "text": "And that's a really interesting question when thinking about alien life or if there's other intelligent alien civilizations out there, is how special is this leap?"}, {"time": 666, "text": "So one special thing seems to be the origin of life itself."}, {"time": 669, "text": "However you define that, there's a gray area."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And the other leap, this is very biased perspective of a human, is the origin of intelligence."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And again, from an engineer perspective, it's a difficult question to ask."}, {"time": 684, "text": "An important one is how difficult is that leap?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "How special were humans?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "Did a monolith come down?"}, {"time": 692, "text": "Did aliens bring down a monolith and some apes had to touch a monolith to get it?"}, {"time": 698, "text": "That's a lot like Descartes idea, right?"}, {"time": 701, "text": "Exactly, but it just seems one heck of a leap to get to this level of intelligence."}, {"time": 708, "text": "Yeah, and so Chomsky argued that some genetic fluke occurred 100,000 years ago and just happened that some human, some hominin predecessor of current humans had this one genetic tweak that resulted in language."}, {"time": 740, "text": "And language then provided this special thing that separates us from all other animals."}, {"time": 756, "text": "I think there's a lot of truth to the value and importance of language, but I think it comes along with the evolution of a lot of other related things related to sociality and mutual engagement with others and establishment of, I don't know, rich mechanisms for organizing and understanding of the world, which language then plugs into."}, {"time": 792, "text": "Right, so language is a tool that allows you to do this kind of collective intelligence."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And whatever is at the core of the thing that allows for this collective intelligence is the main thing."}, {"time": 805, "text": "And it's interesting to think about that one fluke, one mutation could lead to the first crack opening of the door to human intelligence."}, {"time": 818, "text": "All it takes is one."}, {"time": 819, "text": "Evolution just kind of opens the door a little bit, and then time and selection takes care of the rest."}, {"time": 825, "text": "You know, there's so many fascinating aspects to these kinds of things."}, {"time": 829, "text": "So we think of evolution as continuous, right?"}, {"time": 834, "text": "We think, oh, yes, OK, over 500 million years, there could have been this relatively continuous changes."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And but that's not what anthropologists, evolutionary biologists found from the fossil record."}, {"time": 855, "text": "They found hundreds of millions of years of stasis."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And then suddenly a change occurs."}, {"time": 867, "text": "Well, suddenly on that scale is a million years or something, or even 10 million years."}, {"time": 873, "text": "But the concept of punctuated equilibrium was a very important concept in evolutionary biology."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And that also feels somehow right about the stages of our mental abilities."}, {"time": 895, "text": "We seem to have a certain kind of mindset at a certain age."}, {"time": 899, "text": "And then at another age, we look at that four year old and say, oh, my god, how could they have thought that way?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "So Piaget was known for this kind of stage theory of child development, right?"}, {"time": 911, "text": "And you look at it closely, and suddenly those stages are so discreet and it transitions."}, {"time": 917, "text": "But the difference between the four year old and the seven year old is profound."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And that's another thing that's always interested me is how something happens over the course of several years of experience where at some point we reach the point where something like an insight or a transition or a new stage of development occurs."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And these kinds of things can be understood in complex systems research."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And so evolutionary biology, developmental biology, cognitive development are all things that have been approached in this kind of way."}, {"time": 961, "text": "Just like you said, I find both fascinating those early years of human life, but also the early minutes, days from the embryonic development to how from embryos you get the brain."}, {"time": 977, "text": "That development, again, from an engineer perspective, is fascinating."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So it's not."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So the early, when you deploy the brain to the human world and it gets to explore that world and learn, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 990, "text": "But just like the assembly of the mechanism that is capable of learning, that's amazing."}, {"time": 996, "text": "The stuff they're doing with brain organoids where you can build many brains and study that self assembly of a mechanism from the DNA material, that's like, what the heck?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "You have literally biological programs that just generate a system, this mushy thing that's able to be robust and learn in a very unpredictable world and learn seemingly arbitrary things, or a very large number of things that enable survival."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Ultimately, that is a very important part of the whole process of understanding this emergence of mind from brain kind of thing."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And the whole thing seems to be pretty continuous."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So let me step back to neural networks for another brief minute."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "You wrote parallel distributed processing books that explored ideas of neural networks in the 1980s together with a few folks."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "But the books you wrote with David Romelhart, who is the first author on the back propagation paper with Jeff Hinton."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So these are just some figures at the time that we're thinking about these big ideas."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "What are some memorable moments of discovery and beautiful ideas from those early days?"}, {"time": 1084, "text": "I'm going to start sort of with my own process in the mid 70s and then into the late 70s when I met Jeff Hinton and he came to San Diego and we were all together."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "In my time in graduate schools, I've already described to you, I had this sort of feeling of, OK, I'm really interested in human cognition, but this disembodied sort of way of thinking about it that I'm getting from the current mode of thought about it isn't working fully for me."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And when I got my assistant professorship, I went to UCSD and that was in 1974."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Something amazing had just happened."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Dave Romelhart had written a book together with another man named Don Norman and the book was called Explorations in Cognition."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And it was a series of chapters exploring interesting questions about cognition, but in a completely sort of abstract, nonbiological kind of way."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And I'm saying, gee, this is amazing."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "I'm coming to this community where people can get together and feel like they've collectively exploring ideas."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And it was a book that had a lot of, I don't know, lightness to it."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And Don Norman, who was the more senior figure to Romelhart at that time who led that project, always created this spirit of playful exploration of ideas."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And so I'm like, wow, this is great."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "But I was also still trying to get from the neurons to the cognition."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And I realized at one point, I got this opportunity to go to a conference where I heard a talk by a man named James Anderson, who was an engineer, but by then a professor in a psychology department, who had used linear algebra to create neural network models of perception and categorization and memory."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And it just blew me out of the water that one could create a model that was simulating neurons, not just engaged in a stepwise algorithmic process that was construed abstractly."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "But it was simulating remembering and recalling and recognizing the prior occurrence of a stimulus or something like that."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "So for me, this was a bridge between the mind and the brain."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "And I remember I was walking across campus one day in 1977, and I almost felt like St. Paul on the road to Damascus."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "I said to myself, if I think about the mind in terms of a neural network, it will help me answer the questions about the mind that I'm trying to answer."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And that really excited me."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So I think that a lot of people were becoming excited about that."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And one of those people was Jim Anderson, who I had mentioned."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "Another one was Steve Grossberg, who had been writing about neural networks since the 60s."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And Jeff Hinton was yet another."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And his PhD dissertation showed up in an applicant pool to a postdoctoral training program that Dave and Don, the two men I mentioned before, Rumelhart and Norman, were administering."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And Rumelhart got really excited about Hinton's PhD dissertation."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "And so Hinton was one of the first people who came and joined this group of postdoctoral scholars that was funded by this wonderful grant that they got."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Another one who is also well known in neural network circles is Paul Smolenski."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "He was another one of that group."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "Anyway, Jeff and Jim Anderson organized a conference at UCSD where we were."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And it was called Parallel Models of Associative Memory."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And it brought all the people together who had been thinking about these kinds of ideas in 1979 or 1980."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And this began to kind of really resonate with some of Rumelhart's own thinking, some of his reasons for wanting something other than the kinds of computation he'd been doing so far."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So let me talk about Rumelhart now for a minute, OK, with that context."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Well, let me also just pause because he said so many interesting things before we go to Rumelhart."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So first of all, for people who are not familiar, neural networks are at the core of the machine learning, deep learning revolution of today."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Geoffrey Hinton that we mentioned is one of the figures that were important in the history like yourself in the development of these neural networks, artificial neural networks that are then used for the machine learning application."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Like I mentioned, the backpropagation paper is one of the optimization mechanisms by which these networks can learn."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And the word parallel is really interesting."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "So it's almost like synonymous from a computational perspective how you thought at the time about neural networks as parallel computation."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Would that be fair to say?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Well, yeah, the parallel, the word parallel in this comes from the idea that each neuron is an independent computational unit, right?"}, {"time": 1473, "text": "It gathers data from other neurons, it integrates it in a certain way, and then it produces a result."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And it's a very simple little computational unit."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "But it's autonomous in the sense that it does its thing, right?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "It's in a biological medium where it's getting nutrients and various chemicals from that medium."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But you can think of it as almost like a little computer in and of itself."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "So the idea is that each our brains have, oh, look, 100 or hundreds, almost a billion of these little neurons, right?"}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And they're all capable of doing their work at the same time."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So it's like instead of just a single central processor that's engaged in chug one step after another, we have a billion of these little computational units working at the same time."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So at the time that's, I don't know, maybe you can comment, it seems to me, even still to me, quite a revolutionary way to think about computation relative to the development of theoretical computer science alongside of that where it's very much like sequential computer."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're analyzing algorithms that are running on a single computer."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "You're saying, wait a minute, why don't we take a really dumb, very simple computer and just have a lot of them interconnected together?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And they're all operating in their own little world and they're communicating with each other and thinking of computation that way."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "And from that kind of computation, trying to understand how things like certain characteristics of the human mind can emerge."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "That's quite a revolutionary way of thinking, I would say."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Well, yes, I agree with you."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And there's still this sort of sense of not sort of knowing how we kind of get all the way there, I think."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And this very much remains at the core of the questions that everybody's asking about the capabilities of deep learning and all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "But if I could just play this out a little bit, a convolutional neural network or a CNN, which many people may have heard of, is a set of, you could think of it biologically as a set of collections of neurons."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Each collection has maybe 10,000 neurons in it."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "But there's many layers."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "Some of these things are hundreds or even 1,000 layers deep."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "But others are closer to the biological brain and maybe they're like 20 layers deep or something like that."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So within each layer, we have thousands of neurons or tens of thousands maybe."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "Well, in the brain, we probably have millions in each layer."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "But we're getting sort of similar in a certain way."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And then we think, OK, at the bottom level, there's an array of things that are like the photoreceptors."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "In the eye, they respond to the amount of light of a certain wavelength at a certain location on the pixel array."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So that's like the biological eye."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And then there's several further stages going up, layers of these neuron like units."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "And you go from that raw input array of pixels to the classification, you've actually built a system that could do the same kind of thing that you and I do when we open our eyes and we look around and we see there's a cup, there's a cell phone, there's a water bottle."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And these systems are doing that now, right?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "So they are, in terms of the parallel idea that we were talking about before, they are doing this massively parallel computation in the sense that each of the neurons in each of those layers is thought of as computing its little bit of something about the input simultaneously with all the other ones in the same layer."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "We get to the point of abstracting that away and thinking, oh, it's just one whole vector that's being computed, one activation pattern that's computed in a single step."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And that abstraction is useful, but it's still that parallel."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And distributed processing, right?"}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Each one of these guys is just contributing a tiny bit to that whole thing."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And that's the excitement that you felt, that from these simple things, you can emerge."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "When you add these level of abstractions on it, you can start getting all the beautiful things that we think about as cognition."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And so, OK, so you have this conference."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I forgot the name already, but it's Parallel and Something Associative Memory and so on."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Very exciting, technical and exciting title."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And you started talking about Dave Romerhart."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So who is this person that was so, you've spoken very highly of him."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Can you tell me about him, his ideas, his mind, who he was as a human being, as a scientist?"}, {"time": 1824, "text": "So Dave came from a little tiny town in Western South Dakota."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "And his mother was the librarian, and his father was the editor of the newspaper."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And I know one of his brothers pretty well."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "They grew up, there were four brothers, and they grew up together."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And their father encouraged them to compete with each other a lot."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "They competed in sports, and they competed in mind games."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "I don't know, things like Sudoku and chess and various things like that."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And Dave was a standout undergraduate."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "He went at a younger age than most people do to college at the University of South Dakota and majored in mathematics."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And I don't know how he got interested in psychology, but he applied to the mathematical psychology program at Stanford and was accepted as a PhD student to study mathematical psychology at Stanford."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So mathematical psychology is the use of mathematics to model mental processes."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So something that I think these days might be called cognitive modeling, that whole space."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "Yeah, it's mathematical in the sense that you say, if this is true and that is true, then I can derive that this should follow."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And so you say, these are my stipulations about the fundamental principles, and this is my prediction about behavior."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And it's all done with equations."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "It's not done with a computer simulation."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So you solve the equation, and that tells you what the probability that the subject will be correct on the seventh trial or the experiment is or something like that."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So it's a use of mathematics to descriptively characterize aspects of behavior."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And Stanford at that time was the place where there were several really, really strong mathematical thinkers who were also connected with three or four others around the country who brought a lot of really exciting ideas onto the table."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And it was a very, very prestigious part of the field of psychology at that time."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So Rummelhart comes into this."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "He was a very strong student within that program."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "And he got this job at this brand new university in San Diego in 1967, where he's one of the first assistant professors in the Department of Psychology at UCSD."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So I got there in 74, seven years later, and Rummelhart at that time was still doing mathematical modeling."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "But he had gotten interested in cognition."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "He'd gotten interested in understanding."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And understanding, I think, remains, what does it mean to understand anyway?"}, {"time": 2048, "text": "It's an interesting sort of curious, how would we know if we really understood something?"}, {"time": 2054, "text": "But he was interested in building machines that would hear a couple of sentences and have an insight about what was going on."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So for example, one of his favorite things at that time was, Margie was sitting on the front step when she heard the familiar jingle of the good humor man."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "She remembered her birthday money and ran into the house."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "What is Margie doing?"}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Well, there's a couple of ideas you could have, but the most natural one is that the good humor man brings ice cream."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "She likes ice cream."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "She knows she needs money to buy ice cream, so she's going to run into the house and get her money so she can buy herself an ice cream."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "It's a huge amount of inference that has to happen to get those things to link up with each other."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "And he was interested in how the hell that could happen."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And he was trying to build good old fashioned AI style models of representation of language and content of things like has money."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "So like formal logic and knowledge bases, like that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "So he was integrating that with his thinking about cognition."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "The mechanisms of cognition, how can they mechanistically be applied to build these knowledge, like to actually build something that looks like a web of knowledge and thereby from there emerges something like understanding, whatever the heck that is."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Yeah, he was grappling."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "This was something that they grappled with at the end of that book that I was describing, Explorations in Cognition."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "But he was realizing that the paradigm of good old fashioned AI wasn't giving him the answers to these questions."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "By the way, that's called good old fashioned AI now."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "It wasn't called that at the time."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "Well, it was."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "It was beginning to be called that."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "Oh, because it was from the 60s."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "By the late 70s, it was kind of old fashioned, and it hadn't really panned out."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And people were beginning to recognize that."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And Rommelhardt was like, yeah, he's part of the recognition that this wasn't all working."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Anyway, so he started thinking in terms of the idea that we needed systems that allowed us to integrate multiple simultaneous constraints in a way that would be mutually influencing each other."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "So he wrote a paper that just really, first time I read it, I said, oh, well, yeah, but is this important?"}, {"time": 2231, "text": "But after a while, it just got under my skin."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "And it was called An Interactive Model of Reading."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "And in this paper, he laid out the idea that every aspect of our interpretation of what's coming off the page when we read at every level of analysis you can think of actually depends on all the other levels of analysis."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So what are the actual pixels making up each letter?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And what do those pixels signify about which letters they are?"}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And what do those letters tell us about what words are there?"}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And what do those words tell us about what ideas the author is trying to convey?"}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And so he had this model where we have these little tiny elements that represent each of the pixels of each of the letters, and then other ones that represent the line segments in them, and other ones that represent the letters, and other ones that represent the words."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And at that time, his idea was there's this set of experts."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "There's an expert about how to construct a line out of pixels, and another expert about which sets of lines go together to make which letters, and another one about which letters go together to make which words, and another one about what the meanings of the words are, and another one about how the meanings fit together, and things like that."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And all these experts are looking at this data, and they're updating hypotheses at other levels."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "So the word expert can tell the letter expert, oh, I think there should be a T there, because I think there should be a word the here."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "And the bottom up sort of feature to letter expert could say, I think there should be a T there, too."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "And if they agree, then you see a T, right?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "And so there's a top down, bottom up interactive process, but it's going on at all layers simultaneously."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So everything can filter all the way down from the top, as well as all the way up from the bottom."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "And it's a completely interactive, bidirectional, parallel distributed process."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "That is somehow, because of the abstractions, it's hierarchical."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "So there's different layers of responsibilities, different levels of responsibilities."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "First of all, it's fascinating to think about it in this kind of mechanistic way."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "So not thinking purely from the structure of a neural network or something like a neural network, but thinking about these little guys that work on letters, and then the letters come words and words become sentences."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And that's a very interesting hypothesis that from that kind of hierarchical structure can emerge understanding."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Yeah, so, but the thing is, though, I wanna just sort of relate this to the earlier part of the conversation."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "When Romelhart was first thinking about it, there were these experts on the side, one for the features and one for the letters and one for how the letters make the words and so on."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And they would each be working, sort of evaluating various propositions about, you know, is this combination of features here going to be one that looks like the letter T and so on."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "And what he realized, kind of after reading Hinton's dissertation and hearing about Jim Anderson's linear algebra based neural network models that I was telling you about before was that he could replace those experts with neuron like processing units, which just would have their connection weights that would do this job."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So what ended up happening was that Romelhart and I got together and we created a model called the interactive activation model of letter perception, which takes these little pixel level inputs, constructs line segment features, letters and words."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But now we built it out of a set of neuron like processing units that are just connected to each other with connection weights."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "So the unit for the word time has a connection to the unit for the letter T in the first position and the letter I in the second position, so on."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And because these connections are bi directional, if you have prior knowledge that it might be the word time that starts to prime the letters and the features."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And if you don't, then it has to start bottom up."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "But the directionality just depends on where the information comes in first."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And if you have context together with features at the same time, they can convergently result in an emergent perception."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And that was the piece of work that we did together that sort of got us both completely convinced that this neural network way of thinking was going to be able to actually address the questions that we were interested in as cognitive psychologists."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "So the algorithmic side, the optimization side, those are all details like when you first start the idea that you can get far with this kind of way of thinking, that in itself is a profound idea."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "So do you like the term connectionism to describe this kind of set of ideas?"}, {"time": 2587, "text": "I think it's useful."},

to the unit for the word time, right?"}, {"time": 2616, "text": "The unit for the word time isn't a unit for the word time for any other reason than it's got the connections to the letters that make up the word time."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Those are the units on the input that excited when it's excited that it in a sense represents in the system that there's support for the hypothesis that the word time is present in the input."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "But it's not, the word time isn't written anywhere inside the bottle, it's only written there in the picture we drew of the model to say that's the unit for the word time, right?"}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And if somebody wants to tell me, well, how do you spell that word?"}, {"time": 2661, "text": "You have to use the connections from that out to then get those letters, for example."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "That's such a, that's a counterintuitive idea where humans want to think in this logic way."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "This idea of connectionism, it doesn't, it's weird."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "It's weird that this is how it all works."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "Yeah, but let's go back to that CNN, right?"}, {"time": 2686, "text": "That CNN with all those layers of neuron like processing units that we were talking about before, it's gonna come out and say, this is a cat, that's a dog, but it has no idea why it said that."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "It's just got all these connections between all these layers of neurons, like from the very first layer to the, you know, like whatever these layers are, they just get numbered after a while because they, you know, they somehow further in you go, the more abstract the features are, but it's a graded and continuous sort of process of abstraction anyway."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And, you know, it goes from very local, very specific to much more sort of global, but it's still, you know, another sort of pattern of activation over an array of units."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "And then at the output side, it says it's a cat or it's a dog."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "And when I open my eyes and say, oh, that's Lex, or, oh, you know, there's my own dog and I recognize my dog, which is a member of the same species as many other dogs, but I know this one because of some slightly unique characteristics."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "I don't know how to describe what it is that makes me know that I'm looking at Lex or at my particular dog, right?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Or even that I'm looking at a particular brand of car."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "Like I can say a few words about it, but I wrote you a paragraph about the car, you would have trouble figuring out which car is he talking about, right?"}, {"time": 2776, "text": "So the idea that we have propositional knowledge of what it is that allows us to recognize that this is an actual instance of this particular natural kind has always been something that it never worked, right?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "You couldn't ever write down a set of propositions for visual recognition."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And so in that space, it sort of always seemed very natural that something more implicit, you don't have access to what the details of the computation were in between, you just get the result."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So that's the other part of connectionism, you cannot, you don't read the contents of the connections, the connections only cause outputs to occur based on inputs."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "Yeah, and for us that like final layer or some particular layer is very important, the one that tells us that it's our dog or like it's a cat or a dog, but each layer is probably equally as important in the grand scheme of things."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Like there's no reason why the cat versus dog is more important than the lower level activations, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "I mean, all of it is just this beautiful stacking on top of each other."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And we humans live in this particular layers, for us it's useful to survive, to use those cat versus dog, predator versus prey, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "It's fascinating that it's all continuous, but then you then ask, the history of artificial intelligence, you ask, are we able to introspect and convert the very things that allow us to tell the difference between cat and dog into a logic, into formal logic?"}, {"time": 2885, "text": "That's been the dream."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "I would say that's still part of the dream of symbolic AI."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And I've recently talked to Doug Lenat who created Psych and that's a project that lasted for many decades and still carries a sort of dream in it, right?"}, {"time": 2908, "text": "But we still don't know the answer, right?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "It seems like connectionism is really powerful, but it also seems like there's this building of knowledge."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "And so how do we, how do you square those two?"}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Like, do you think the connections can contain the depth of human knowledge and the depth of what Dave Romahart was thinking about of understanding?"}, {"time": 2931, "text": "Well, that remains the $64 question."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And I...

from the emergentist side, which, you know, I placed myself on."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So I used to sometimes tell people I was a radical, eliminative connectionist because I didn't want them to think that I wanted to build like anything into the machine."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "But I don't like the word eliminative anymore because it makes it seem like it's wrong to think that there is this emergent level of understanding."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And I disagree with that."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "So I think, you know, I would call myself an a radical emergentist connectionist

exist as such."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And there was an example that Doug Hofstadter used to use that I thought was helpful in this respect."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "Just the idea that we can think about sand dunes as entities and talk about like how many there are even."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "But we also know that a sand dune is a very fluid thing."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "It's a pile of sand that is capable of moving around under the wind and reforming itself in somewhat different ways."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "And that's where I think the connectionist feeds into the cognitive."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's like, okay, so if the substrate is parallel distributed connectionist, then it doesn't mean that the contents of thought isn't like abstract and symbolic, but it's more fluid maybe than it's easier to capture with a set of logical expressions."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "Yeah, that's a heck of a sort of thing to put at the top of a resume, radical, emergentist, connectionist."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So there is, just like you said, a beautiful dance between that, between the machinery of intelligence, like the neural network side of it, and the stuff that emerges."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "I mean, the stuff that emerges seems to be, I don't know, I don't know what that is, that it seems like maybe all of reality is emergent."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "What I think about, this is made most distinctly rich to me when I look at cellular automata, look at game of life, that from very, very simple things, very rich, complex things emerge that start looking very quickly like organisms that you forget how the actual thing operates."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "They start looking like they're moving around, they're eating each other, some of them are generating offspring."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "You forget very quickly."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "And it seems like maybe it's something about the human mind that wants to operate in some layer of the emergent, and forget about the mechanism of how that emergence happens."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "So it, just like you are in your radicalness, I'm also, it seems like unfair to eliminate the magic of that emergent, like eliminate the fact that that emergent is real."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Yeah, no, I agree."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "I'm not, that's why I got rid of eliminative, right?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "Eliminative, yeah."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "Yeah, because it seemed like that was trying to say that it's all completely like."}, {"time": 3241,

that philosophically many people have confronted that possibility over time, but it's still important to accept it as magic, right?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "So, I think of Fellini in this context, I

disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators have chosen to call semantic dementia."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "So it's a specific form of loss of mind related to meaning, semantic

from sound, from language."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "They, I hear sounds, but I don't know what they mean kind of thing."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "So as this illness progresses, it starts with the patient being unable to differentiate like similar breeds of dog or remember the lower frequency unfamiliar categories that they used to be able to remember."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "But as it progresses, it becomes more and more striking and the patient loses the ability to recognize things like pigs and goats and sheep and calls all middle sized animals dogs and can't recognize rabbits

dogs."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "This is just a part of the syndrome though."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "The patient loses the ability to relate concepts to each other."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So my collaborator in this work, Carolyn Patterson, developed a test called the pyramids and palm trees test."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "So you give the patient a picture of pyramids and they have a choice which goes with the pyramids, palm trees or pine trees."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "And she showed that this wasn't just a matter of language because the patient's loss of this ability shows up whether you present the material with words or with pictures."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "The pictures, they can't put the pictures together with each other properly anymore."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "They can't relate the pictures to the words either."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "They can't do word picture matching."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "But they've lost the conceptual grounding from either modality

the differences."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So the difference between the dog and the goat is no longer part of the pattern anymore."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And since dog is really familiar, that's the thing that remains."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "And we understand that in the way the models work and learn."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "But Rumelhart underwent this condition."}, {"time": 3657,

{"time": 4154, "text": "I want my machine to correctly classify all of these images."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "And I can score that."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "I can measure how well they're doing on each image."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And I get some measure of error or loss, it's typically called in deep learning."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And I'm going to figure out how to adjust the connection weights so as to minimize my loss or reduce the error."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "And that's called, you know, gradient descent."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And engineers were already familiar with the concept of gradient descent."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "And in fact, there was an algorithm called the delta rule that had been invented by a professor in the electrical engineering

multiple neuron like processing units was already understood for a single layer of connection weights."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "We have some inputs over a set of neurons."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "We want the output to produce a certain pattern."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "We can define the difference between our target and what the neural network is producing."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "And we can figure out how to change the connection weights to reduce that error."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "So what Romilhar did was to generalize that so as to be able to change the connections from earlier layers of units to the ones at a hidden layer between the input and the output."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "And so he first called the algorithm the generalized delta rule because it's just an extension of the gradient descent idea."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And interestingly enough, Hinton was thinking that this wasn't going to work very well."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "So Hinton had his own alternative algorithm at the time based on the concept of the Boltzmann machine that he was pursuing."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "So the paper on the Boltzmann machine came out in, learning in Boltzmann machines came out in 1985."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "But it turned out that back prop worked better than the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "So this generalized delta algorithm ended up being called back propagation, as you say, back prop."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "And probably that name is opaque to me."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "What it meant was that in order to figure out what the changes you needed to make to the connections from the input to the hidden layer, you had to back propagate the error signals from the output layer through the connections from the hidden layer to the output to get the signals that would be the error signals for the hidden layer."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And that's how Rumelhart formulated it."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "It was like, well, we know what the error signals are at the output layer."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "Let's see if we can get a signal at the hidden layer that tells each hidden unit what its error signal is essentially."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "So it's back propagating through the connections from the hidden to the output to get the signals to tell the hidden units how to change their weights from the input."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "And that's why it's called back prop."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "But so it came from Hinton having introduced the concept of, you know, define your objective function, figure out how to take the derivative so that you can adjust the connections so that they make progress towards your goal."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "So stop thinking about biology for a second and let's start to think about optimization and computation a little bit more."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "So what about Jeff Hinton?"}, {"time": 4395, "text": "You've gotten a chance to work with him in that little thing."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "The set of people involved there is quite incredible."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "The small set of people under the PDP flag,

Hinton is seen as one of the, not just like a seminal figure in AI, but just a brilliant person, just like the horsepower of the mind is pretty high up there for him because he's just a great thinker."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So what kind of ideas have you learned from him?"}, {"time": 4437, "text": "Have you influenced each other on?"}, {"time": 4439, "text": "Have you debated over what stands out to you in the full space of ideas here at the intersection of computation and cognition?"}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Well, so Jeff has said many things to me that had a profound impact on my thinking."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And he's written several articles which were way ahead of their time."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "He had two papers in 1981, just to give one example, one of which was essentially the idea of transformers and another of which was an early paper on semantic cognition which inspired him and Rumelhart and me throughout the 80s and, you know, still I think sort of grounds my own thinking about the semantic aspects of cognition."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "He also, in a small paper that was never published that he wrote in 1977, you know, before he actually arrived at UCSD or maybe a couple years even before that, I don't know, when he was a PhD student, he described how a neural network could do recursive computation."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "And it was a very clever idea that he's continued to explore over time, which was sort of the idea that when you call a subroutine, you need to save the state that you had when you called it so you can get back to where you were when you're finished with the subroutine."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "And the idea was that you would save the state of the calling routine by making fast changes to connection weights."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "And then when you finished with the subroutine call, those fast changes in the connection weights would allow you to go back to where you had been before and reinstate the previous context so that you could continue on with the top level of the computation."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "Anyway, that was part of the idea."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "And I always thought, okay, that's really, you know, he had extremely creative ideas that were quite a lot ahead of his time and many of them in the 1970s and early 1980s."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "So another thing about Geoff Hinton's way of thinking, which has profoundly influenced my effort to understand human mathematical cognition, is that he doesn't write too many equations."}, {"time": 4633,

too big a jump, you're going to jump to the other side."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And so that's why we have to turn down the learning rate, for example."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "And it speaks to me of the fundamentally intuitive character of deep insight together with a commitment to really understanding in a way that's absolutely ultimately explicit and clear, but also intuitive."}, {"time":

{"time": 4783, "text": "And together with the deeply intuitive thinking ability that he has, he also has, it's been clear, he's described this to me, and I think he's mentioned it from time to time in other interviews that he's had with people."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "He's wanted to be able to sort of think of himself as contributing to the understanding of reasoning itself, not just human reasoning."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "Like Boole is about logic, right?"}, {"time": 4825, "text": "It's about what can we conclude from what else and how do we formalize that."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "And as a computer scientist, logician, philosopher, the goal is to understand how we derive truths from other, from givens and things like this."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And the work that

constraint satisfaction realm."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And it was a beautiful set of ideas linked with theoretical physics as well as with logic."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "And it's always been, I mean, I've always been inspired by the Bolton machine too."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "It's like, well, if the neurons are probabilistic rather than deterministic in their computations, then maybe this

might be sort of partially the result of a stochastic process."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "And that too is part of the magic of the emergence of some of these things."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "Well, you're right with the Boolean lineage and the dream of computer science is somehow, I mean, I certainly think of humans this way, that humans are one particular manifestation of intelligence, that

{"time": 4950, "text": "So I think of, I started using the phrase computational intelligence at some point as to characterize the field that I thought, you know, people like Geoff Hinton and many of the people I know at DeepMind are working in and where I feel like I'm, you know, I'm a kind of a human oriented computational intelligence researcher in that I'm actually kind of interested in the human solution."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "But at the same time, I feel like that's where a huge amount of the excitement of deep learning actually lies is in the idea that, you know, we may be able

5026, "text": "Perhaps allowing us to scale the very mechanisms of human intelligence just increases power through scale."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "And I think that that, you know, obviously that's

conclude that the triangles are congruent."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "That is to say they have all of their properties in common."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "And that is something about triangles."},

launched from the planet Earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out in way beyond Pluto somewhere at exactly a predicted time and date is something that depends on these ideas."},

idealized objects, these triangles or these distances or these points, whatever they are, that allow for this set of tools to be created that then gives human beings this incredible leverage that they didn't have without these concepts."}, {"time": 5331, "text": "And I think this is actually already true when we think about just, you know, the natural numbers."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "I always

one in the same time sort of abstract and idealized and generalizable, while on the other hand, potentially very, very grounded and concrete."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "And one of the things that makes for the incredible achievements of the human mind is the fact that humans invented these idealized systems that leverage the power of human thought in such a way as to allow all this kind of thing to happen."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And so that's what mathematics to me is the development of systems for thinking about the properties and relations among sets of idealized objects and the mathematical notation system that we unfortunately focus way too much on is just our way of expressing propositions about these properties."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "It's just like we're talking with

model?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "The insights that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of the intuitive kind of connectionist like knowledge that makes it so that something is

with this formal system."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "So I think of the ability of somebody like Hinton or Newton or Einstein or Rumelhart or Poincare to Archimedes is another example."}, {"time": 5661,

that allow me to make it rigorous and certain?"}, {"time": 5701, "text": "And so I feel like the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of hope or encouragement that ultimately it'll all happen."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "So in particular as many people now have become really interested in thinking about, you know,

caused me to become really excited to kind of collaborate with some of those people and analyze it at DeepMind."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "So I think though that what I like to really emphasize here is one part of what I like to emphasize about mathematical cognition at least is that philosophers and logicians going back three or even a little more than 3000 years ago began to develop these

as a paradigm."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And what I find interesting is the idea that the ability to become a person who is capable of thinking in this abstract formal way is a result of the same
