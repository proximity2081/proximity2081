{"time": 305, "text": "What philosophers, thinkers, or ideas had a big impact on you growing up and today?"}, {"time": 310, "text": "So one author that had a big impact on me when I read his books as a teenager was Jean Piaget, who is a Swiss psychologist, is considered to be the father of developmental psychology."}, {"time": 325, "text": "And he has a large body of work about basically how intelligence develops in children."}, {"time": 333, "text": "And so it's very old work, like most of it is from the 1930s, 1940s."}, {"time": 339, "text": "So it's not quite up to date."}, {"time": 340, "text": "It's actually superseded by many newer developments in developmental psychology."}, {"time": 345, "text": "But to me, it was very interesting, very striking, and actually shaped the early ways in which I started thinking about the mind and the development of intelligence as a teenager."}, {"time": 356, "text": "His actual ideas or the way he thought about it or just the fact that you could think about the developing mind at all?"}, {"time": 361, "text": "I guess both."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Jean Piaget is the author that really introduced me to the notion that intelligence and the mind is something that you construct throughout your life and that children construct it in stages."}, {"time": 375, "text": "And I thought that was a very interesting idea, which is, of course, very relevant to AI, to building artificial minds."}, {"time": 383, "text": "Another book that I read around the same time that had a big impact on me, and there was actually a little bit of overlap with Jean Piaget as well, and I read it around the same time, is Geoff Hawking's On Intelligence, which is a classic."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And he has this vision of the mind as a multi scale hierarchy of temporal prediction modules."}, {"time": 407, "text": "And these ideas really resonated with me, like the notion of a modular hierarchy of potentially compression functions or prediction functions."}, {"time": 421, "text": "I thought it was really, really interesting, and it shaped the way I started thinking about how to build minds."}, {"time": 429, "text": "The hierarchical nature, which aspect?"}, {"time": 433, "text": "Also, he's a neuroscientist, so he was thinking actual, he was basically talking about how our mind works."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Yeah, the notion that cognition is prediction was an idea that was kind of new to me at the time and that I really loved at the time."}, {"time": 447, "text": "And yeah, and the notion that there are multiple scales of processing in the brain."}, {"time": 455, "text": "The hierarchy."}, {"time": 457, "text": "This was before deep learning."}, {"time": 458, "text": "These ideas of hierarchies in AI have been around for a long time, even before on intelligence."}, {"time": 465, "text": "They've been around since the 1980s."}, {"time": 468, "text": "And yeah, that was before deep learning."}, {"time": 470, "text": "But of course, I think these ideas really found their practical implementation in deep learning."}, {"time": 478, "text": "What about the memory side of things?"}, {"time": 479, "text": "I think he was talking about knowledge representation."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Do you think about memory a lot?"}, {"time": 484, "text": "One way you can think of neural networks as a kind of memory, you're memorizing things, but it doesn't seem to be the kind of memory that's in our brains, or it doesn't have the same rich complexity, long term nature that's in our brains."}, {"time": 500, "text": "Yes, the brain is more of a sparse access memory so that you can actually retrieve very precisely like bits of your experience."}, {"time": 510, "text": "The retrieval aspect, you can like introspect, you can ask yourself questions."}, {"time": 515, "text": "I guess you can program your own memory and language is actually the tool you use to do that."}, {"time": 521, "text": "I think language is a kind of operating system for the mind and use language."}, {"time": 527, "text": "Well, one of the uses of language is as a query that you run over your own memory, use words as keys to retrieve specific experiences or specific concepts, specific thoughts."}, {"time": 540, "text": "Like language is a way you store thoughts, not just in writing, in the physical world, but also in your own mind."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And it's also how you retrieve them."}, {"time": 547, "text": "Like, imagine if you didn't have language, then you would have to, you would not really have a self, internally triggered way of retrieving past thoughts."}, {"time": 558, "text": "You would have to rely on external experiences."}, {"time": 561, "text": "For instance, you see a specific site, you smell a specific smell and that brings up memories, but you would not really have a way to deliberately access these memories without language."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Well, the interesting thing you mentioned is you can also program the memory."}, {"time": 577, "text": "You can change it probably with language."}, {"time": 579, "text": "Yeah, using language, yes."}, {"time": 581, "text": "Well, let me ask you a Chomsky question, which is like, first of all, do you think language is like fundamental, like there's turtles, what's at the bottom of the turtles?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "They don't go, it can't be turtles all the way down."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Is language at the bottom of cognition of everything?"}, {"time": 600, "text": "Is like language, the fundamental aspect of like what it means to be a thinking thing?"}, {"time": 612, "text": "I think language is."}, {"time": 612, "text": "You disagree with Norm Chomsky?"}, {"time": 614, "text": "Yes, I think language is a layer on top of cognition."}, {"time": 617, "text": "So it is fundamental to cognition in the sense that to use a computing metaphor, I see language as the operating system of the brain, of the human mind."}, {"time": 629, "text": "And the operating system is a layer on top of the computer."}, {"time": 633, "text": "The computer exists before the operating system, but the operating system is how you make it truly useful."}, {"time": 639, "text": "And the operating system is most likely Windows, not Linux, because language is messy."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Yeah, it's messy and it's pretty difficult to inspect it, introspect it."}, {"time": 653, "text": "How do you think about language?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "Like we use actually sort of human interpretable language, but is there something like a deeper, that's closer to like logical type of statements?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Like, yeah, what is the nature of language, do you think?"}, {"time": 676, "text": "Like is there something deeper than like the syntactic rules we construct?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "Is there something that doesn't require utterances or writing or so on?"}, {"time": 685, "text": "Are you asking about the possibility that there could exist languages for thinking that are not made of words?"}, {"time": 694, "text": "I think, so the mind is layers, right?"}, {"time": 698, "text": "And language is almost like the outermost, the uppermost layer."}, {"time": 704, "text": "But before we think in words, I think we think in terms of emotion in space and we think in terms of physical actions."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And I think babies in particular, probably expresses thoughts in terms of the actions that they've seen or that they can perform and in terms of motions of objects in their environment before they start thinking in terms of words."}, {"time": 730, "text": "It's amazing to think about that as the building blocks of language."}, {"time": 736, "text": "So like the kind of actions and ways the babies see the world as like more fundamental than the beautiful Shakespearean language you construct on top of it."}, {"time": 748, "text": "And we probably don't have any idea what that looks like, right?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "Like what, because it's important for them trying to engineer it into AI systems."}, {"time": 758, "text": "I think visual analogies and motion is a fundamental building block of the mind."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And you actually see it reflected in language."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Like language is full of special metaphors."}, {"time": 771, "text": "And when you think about things, I consider myself very much as a visual thinker."}, {"time": 777, "text": "You often express these thoughts by using things like visualizing concepts in 2D space or like you solve problems by imagining yourself navigating a concept space."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So I don't know if you have this sort of experience."}, {"time": 797, "text": "You said visualizing concept space."}, {"time": 799, "text": "So like, so I certainly think about, I certainly visualize mathematical concepts, but you mean like in concept space, visually you're embedding ideas into a three dimensional space you can explore with your mind essentially?"}, {"time": 818, "text": "You should be more like 2D, but yeah."}, {"time": 820, "text": "2D?"}, {"time": 822, "text": "You're a flatlander."}, {"time": 823, "text": "You're, okay."}, {"time": 825, "text": "No, I do not."}, {"time": 829, "text": "I always have to, before I jump from concept to concept, I have to put it back down on paper."}, {"time": 837, "text": "It has to be on paper."}, {"time": 838, "text": "I can only travel on 2D paper, not inside my mind."}, {"time": 843, "text": "You're able to move inside your mind."}, {"time": 845, "text": "But even if you're writing like a paper, for instance, don't you have like a spatial representation of your paper?"}, {"time": 851, "text": "Like you visualize where ideas lie topologically in relationship to other ideas, kind of like a subway map of the ideas in your paper."}, {"time": 863, "text": "I mean, there is, in papers, I don't know about you, but it feels like there's a destination."}, {"time": 872, "text": "There's a key idea that you want to arrive at."}, {"time": 876, "text": "And a lot of it is in the fog and you're trying to kind of, it's almost like, what's that called when you do a path planning search from both directions, from the start and from the end."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And then you find, you do like shortest path, but like, you know, in game playing, you do this with like A star from both sides."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And you see where we're on the join."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Yeah, so you kind of do, at least for me, I think like, first of all, just exploring from the start from like first principles, what do I know, what can I start proving from that, right?"}, {"time": 915, "text": "And then from the destination, if you start backtracking, like if I want to show some kind of sets of ideas, what would it take to show them and you kind of backtrack, but like, yeah, I don't think I'm doing all that in my mind though."}, {"time": 931, "text": "Like I'm putting it down on paper."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Do you use mind maps to organize your ideas?"}, {"time": 935, "text": "Yeah, I like mind maps."}, {"time": 937, "text": "Let's get into this, because I've been so jealous of people."}, {"time": 941, "text": "I haven't really tried it."}, {"time": 942, "text": "I've been jealous of people that seem to like, they get like this fire of passion in their eyes because everything starts making sense."}, {"time": 950, "text": "It's like Tom Cruise in the movie was like moving stuff around."}, {"time": 953, "text": "Some of the most brilliant people I know use mind maps."}, {"time": 955, "text": "I haven't tried really."}, {"time": 957, "text": "Can you explain what the hell a mind map is?"}, {"time": 961, "text": "I guess mind map is a way to make kind of like the mess inside your mind to just put it on paper so that you gain more control over it."}, {"time": 970, "text": "It's a way to organize things on paper and as kind of like a consequence of organizing things on paper, they start being more organized inside your own mind."}, {"time": 980, "text": "So what does that look like?"}, {"time": 981, "text": "You put, like, do you have an example?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "Like what's the first thing you write on paper?"}, {"time": 987, "text": "What's the second thing you write?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "I mean, typically you draw a mind map to organize the way you think about a topic."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So you would start by writing down like the key concept about that topic."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Like you would write intelligence or something, and then you would start adding associative connections."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Like what do you think about when you think about intelligence?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "What do you think are the key elements of intelligence?"}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So maybe you would have language, for instance, and you'd have motion."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And so you would start drawing notes with these things."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And then you would see what do you think about when you think about motion and so on."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And you would go like that, like a tree."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Is it a tree mostly or is it a graph too, like a tree?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Oh, it's more of a graph than a tree."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "And it's not limited to just writing down words."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "You can also draw things."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And it's not supposed to be purely hierarchical, right?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "The point is that once you start writing it down, you can start reorganizing it so that it makes more sense, so that it's connected in a more effective way."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "See, but I'm so OCD that you just mentioned intelligence and language and motion."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I would start becoming paranoid that the categorization isn't perfect."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Like that I would become paralyzed with the mind map that like this may not be."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "So like the, even though you're just doing associative kind of connections, there's an implied hierarchy that's emerging."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And I would start becoming paranoid that it's not the proper hierarchy."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So you're not just, one way to see mind maps is you're putting thoughts on paper."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It's like a stream of consciousness, but then you can also start getting paranoid."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Well, is this the right hierarchy?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Sure, which it's mind maps, your mind map."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "You're free to draw anything you want."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "You're free to draw any connection you want."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And you can just make a different mind map if you think the central node is not the right node."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Yeah, I suppose there's a fear of being wrong."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "If you want to organize your ideas by writing down what you think, which I think is very effective."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Like how do you know what you think about something if you don't write it down, right?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "If you do that, the thing is that it imposes much more syntactic structure over your ideas, which is not required with mind maps."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So mind map is kind of like a lower level, more freehand way of organizing your thoughts."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And once you've drawn it, then you can start actually voicing your thoughts in terms of, you know, paragraphs."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It's a two dimensional aspect of layout too, right?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It's a kind of flower, I guess, you start."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "There's usually, you want to start with a central concept?"}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Then you move out."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Typically it ends up more like a subway map."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So it ends up more like a graph, a topological graph without a root node."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "Yeah, so like in a subway map, there are some nodes that are more connected than others."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And there are some nodes that are more important than others."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So there are destinations, but it's not going to be purely like a tree, for instance."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Yeah, it's fascinating to think that if there's something to that about the way our mind thinks."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "By the way, I just kind of remembered obvious thing that I have probably thousands of documents in Google Doc at this point, that are bullet point lists, which is, you can probably map a mind map to a bullet point list."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "It's the same, it's a, no, it's not, it's a tree."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "It's a tree, yeah."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So I create trees, but also they don't have the visual element."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "Like, I guess I'm comfortable with the structure."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "It feels like the narrowness, the constraints feel more comforting."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "If you have thousands of documents with your own thoughts in Google Docs, why don't you write some kind of search engine, like maybe a mind map, a piece of software, mind mapping software, where you write down a concept and then it gives you sentences or paragraphs from your thousand Google Docs document that match this concept."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "The problem is it's so deeply, unlike mind maps, it's so deeply rooted in natural language."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So it's not, it's not semantically searchable, I would say, because the categories are very, you kind of mentioned intelligence, language, and motion."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "They're very strong, semantic."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Like, it feels like the mind map forces you to be semantically clear and specific."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "The bullet points list I have are sparse, desperate thoughts that poetically represent a category like motion, as opposed to saying motion."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "So unfortunately, that's the same problem with the internet."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "That's why the idea of semantic web is difficult to get."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "It's, most language on the internet is a giant mess of natural language that's hard to interpret, which, so do you think there's something to mind maps as, you actually originally brought it up as we were talking about kind of cognition and language."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Do you think there's something to mind maps about how our brain actually deals, like think reasons about things?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "I think it's reasonable to assume that there is some level of topological processing in the brain, that the brain is very associative in nature."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And I also believe that a topological space is a better medium to encode thoughts than a geometric space."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So I think... What's the difference in a topological and a geometric space?"}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Well, if you're talking about topologies, then points are either connected or not."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "So a topology is more like a subway map."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And geometry is when you're interested in the distance between things."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And in a subway map, you don't really have the concept of distance."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "You only have the concept of whether there is a train going from station A to station B."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "And what we do in deep learning is that we're actually dealing with geometric spaces."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "We are dealing with concept vectors, word vectors, that have a distance between them to express in terms of that product."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "So we are not really building topological models usually."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "Like distance is a fundamental importance in deep learning."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "I mean, it's the continuous aspect of it."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Yes, because everything is a vector and everything has to be a vector because everything has to be differentiable."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "If your space is discrete, it's no longer differentiable."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "You cannot do deep learning in it anymore."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Well, you could, but you can only do it by embedding it in a bigger continuous space."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "So if you do topology in the context of deep learning, you have to do it by embedding your topology in the geometry."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "Well, let me zoom out for a second."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "Let's get into your paper on the measure of intelligence that you put out in 2019."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "Yeah, remember 2019?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "That was a different time."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Yeah, I remember."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I still remember."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It feels like a different world."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "You could travel, you could actually go outside and see friends."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Let me ask the most absurd question."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "I think there's some nonzero probability there'll be a textbook one day, like 200 years from now on artificial intelligence, or it'll be called like just intelligence cause humans will already be gone."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "It'll be your picture with a quote."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "This is, you know, one of the early biological systems would consider the nature of intelligence and there'll be like a definition of how they thought about intelligence."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Which is one of the things you do in your paper on measure intelligence is to ask like, well, what is intelligence and how to test for intelligence and so on."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "So is there a spiffy quote about what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 1501, "text": "What is the definition of intelligence according to Francois Chollet?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Yeah, so do you think the super intelligent AIs of the future will want to remember us the way we remember humans from the past?"}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And do you think they will be, you know, they won't be ashamed of having a biological origin?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "No, I think it would be a niche topic."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "It won't be that interesting, but it'll be like the people that study in certain contexts like historical civilization that no longer exists, the Aztecs and so on."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "That's how it'll be seen."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And it'll be study in also the context on social media."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "There'll be hashtags about the atrocity committed to human beings when the robots finally got rid of them."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Like it was a mistake."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "You'll be seen as a giant mistake, but ultimately in the name of progress and it created a better world because humans were over consuming the resources and they were not very rational and were destructive in the end in terms of productivity and putting more love in the world."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "And so within that context, there'll be a chapter about these biological systems."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "It seems to have a very detailed vision of that hit here."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "You should write a sci fi novel about it."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "I'm working on a sci fi novel currently, yes."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "Self published, yeah."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "The definition of intelligence."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So intelligence is the efficiency with which you acquire new skills at tasks that you did not previously know about, that you did not prepare for, right?"}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So intelligence is not skill itself."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "It's not what you know, it's not what you can do."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "It's how well and how efficiently you can learn new things."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "New things."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "The idea of newness there seems to be fundamentally important."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So you would see intelligence on display, for instance."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "Whenever you see a human being or an AI creature adapt to a new environment that it does not see before, that its creators did not anticipate."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "When you see adaptation, when you see improvisation, when you see generalization, that's intelligence."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "In reverse, if you have a system that when you put it in a slightly new environment, it cannot adapt, it cannot improvise, it cannot deviate from what it's hard coded to do or what it has been trained to do, that is a system that is not intelligent."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "There's actually a quote from Einstein that captures this idea, which is, the measure of intelligence is the ability to change."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "I like that quote."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "I think it captures at least part of this idea."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "You know, there might be something interesting about the difference between your definition and Einstein's."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "I mean, he's just being Einstein and clever, but acquisition of new ability to deal with new things versus ability to just change."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "What's the difference between those two things?"}, {"time": 1696, "text": "So just change in itself."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "Do you think there's something to that?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Just being able to change."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Yes, being able to adapt."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "So not change, but certainly change its direction."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Being able to adapt yourself to your environment."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "Whatever the environment is."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "That's a big part of intelligence."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And intelligence is more precisely, you know, how efficiently you're able to adapt, how efficiently you're able to basically master your environment, how efficiently you can acquire new skills."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And I think there's a big distinction to be drawn between intelligence, which is a process, and the output of that process, which is skill."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "So for instance, if you have a very smart human brain, so for instance, if you have a very smart human programmer that considers the game of chess, and that writes down a static program that can play chess, then the intelligence is the process of developing that program."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "But the program itself is just encoding the output artifact of that process."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "The program itself is not intelligent."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And the way you tell it's not intelligent is that if you put it in a different context, you ask it to play Go or something, it's not going to be able to perform well without human involvement, because the source of intelligence, the entity that is capable of that process is the human programmer."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So we should be able to tell the difference between the process and its output."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "We should not confuse the output and the process."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "It's the same as, you know, do not confuse a road building company and one specific road, because one specific road takes you from point A to point B, but a road building company can take you from, can make a path from anywhere to anywhere else."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Yeah, that's beautifully put, but it's also to play devil's advocate a little bit."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "You know, it's possible that there's something more fundamental than us humans."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "So you kind of said the programmer creates the difference between the choir, the skill and the skill itself."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "There could be something like, you could argue the universe is more intelligent."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Like the base intelligence that we should be trying to measure is something that created humans."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "We should be measuring God or the source of the universe as opposed to, like there could be a deeper intelligence."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "There's always deeper intelligence, I guess."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "You can argue that, but that does not take anything away from the fact that humans are intelligent."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And you can tell that because they are capable of adaptation and generality."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "And you see that in particular in the fact that humans are capable of handling situations and tasks that are quite different from anything that any of our evolutionary ancestors has ever encountered."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So we are capable of generalizing very much out of distribution, if you consider our evolutionary history as being in a way our training data."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Of course, evolutionary biologists would argue that we're not going too far out of the distribution."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "We're like mapping the skills we've learned previously, desperately trying to like jam them into like these new situations."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "I mean, there's definitely a little bit of that, but it's pretty clear to me that we're able to, most of the things we do any given day in our modern civilization are things that are very, very different from what our ancestors a million years ago would have been doing in a given day."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "And your environment is very different."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So I agree that everything we do, we do it with cognitive building blocks that we acquired over the course of evolution, right?"}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And that anchors our cognition to a certain context, which is the human condition very much."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "But still our mind is capable of a pretty remarkable degree of generality far beyond anything we can create in artificial systems today."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Like the degree in which the mind can generalize from its evolutionary history, can generalize away from its evolutionary history is much greater than the degree to which a deep learning system today can generalize away from its training data."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "And like the key point you're making, which I think is quite beautiful is like, we shouldn't measure, if we're talking about measurement, we shouldn't measure the skill."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "We should measure like the creation of the new skill, the ability to create that new skill."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But it's tempting, like it's weird because the skill is a little bit of a small window into the system."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So whenever you have a lot of skills, it's tempting to measure the skills."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "I mean, the skill is the only thing you can objectively measure, but yeah."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "So the thing to keep in mind is that when you see skill in the human, it gives you a strong signal that that human is intelligent because you know they weren't born with that skill typically."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Like you see a very strong chess player, maybe you're a very strong chess player yourself."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "I think you're saying that because I'm Russian and now you're prejudiced, you assume."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "All Russians are good at chess."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "I'm biased, exactly."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "I'm biased, yeah."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Well, you're definitely biased."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So if you see a very strong chess player, you know they weren't born knowing how to play chess."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "So they had to acquire that skill with their limited resources, with their limited lifetime."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And they did that because they are generally intelligent."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And so they may as well have acquired any other skill."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "You know they have this potential."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "And on the other hand, if you see a computer playing chess, you cannot make the same assumptions because you cannot just assume the computer is generally intelligent."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "The computer may be born knowing how to play chess in the sense that it may have been programmed by a human that has understood chess for the computer and that has just encoded the output of that understanding in a static program."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And that program is not intelligent."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "So let's zoom out just for a second and say like, what is the goal on the measure of intelligence paper?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "Like what do you hope to achieve with it?"}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the goal of the paper is to clear up some longstanding misunderstandings about the way we've been conceptualizing intelligence in the AI community and in the way we've been evaluating progress in AI."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "There's been a lot of progress recently in machine learning and people are extrapolating from that progress that we are about to solve general intelligence."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And if you want to be able to evaluate these statements, you need to precisely define what you're talking about when you're talking about general intelligence."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And you need a formal way, a reliable way to measure how much intelligence, how much general intelligence a system processes."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "And ideally this measure of intelligence should be actionable."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "So it should not just describe what intelligence is."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "It should not just be a binary indicator that tells you the system is intelligent or it isn't."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "It should be actionable."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "It should have explanatory power, right?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So you could use it as a feedback signal."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It would show you the way towards building more intelligent systems."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "So at the first level, you draw a distinction between two divergent views of intelligence."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "As we just talked about, intelligence is a collection of task specific skills and a general learning ability."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "So what's the difference between kind of this memorization of skills and a general learning ability?"}, {"time": 2197, "text": "We've talked about it a little bit, but can you try to linger on this topic for a bit?"}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Yeah, so the first part of the paper is an assessment of the different ways we've been thinking about intelligence and the different ways we've been evaluating progress in AI."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "And this tree of cognitive sciences has been shaped by two views of the human mind."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "And one view is the evolutionary psychology view in which the mind is a collection of fairly static special purpose ad hoc mechanisms that have been hard coded by evolution over our history as a species for a very long time."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And early AI researchers, people like Marvin Minsky, for instance, they clearly subscribed to this view."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "And they saw the mind as a kind of collection of static programs similar to the programs they would run on like mainframe computers."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "And in fact, I think they very much understood the mind through the metaphor of the mainframe computer because that was the tool they were working with, right?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And so you had these static programs, this collection of very different static programs operating over a database like memory."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And in this picture, learning was not very important."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Learning was considered to be just memorization."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And in fact, learning is basically not featured in AI textbooks until the 1980s with the rise of machine learning."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "It's kind of fun to think about that learning was the outcast."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Like the weird people working on learning, like the mainstream AI world was, I mean, I don't know what the best term is, but it's non learning."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "It was seen as like reasoning would not be learning based."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Yes, it was considered that the mind was a collection of programs that were primarily logical in nature."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "And that's all you needed to do to create a mind was to write down these programs and they would operate over knowledge, which would be stored in some kind of database."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And as long as your database would encompass, you know, everything about the world and your logical rules were comprehensive, then you would have a mind."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "So the other view of the mind is the brain as a sort of blank slate, right?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "This is a very old idea."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "You find it in John Locke's writings."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "This is the tabula rasa."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And this is this idea that the mind is some kind of like information sponge that starts empty, that starts blank."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And that absorbs knowledge and skills from experience, right?"}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So it's a sponge that reflects the complexity of the world, the complexity of your life experience, essentially."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "That everything you know and everything you can do is a reflection of something you found in the outside world, essentially."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "So this is an idea that's very old."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "That was not very popular, for instance, in the 1970s."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "But that gained a lot of vitality recently with the rise of connectionism, in particular deep learning."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "And so today, deep learning is the dominant paradigm in AI."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "And I feel like lots of AI researchers are conceptualizing the mind via a deep learning metaphor."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Like they see the mind as a kind of randomly initialized neural network that starts blank when you're born."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And then that gets trained via exposure to trained data that acquires knowledge and skills via exposure to trained data."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "By the way, it's a small tangent."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "I feel like people who are thinking about intelligence are not conceptualizing it that way."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "I actually haven't met too many people who believe that a neural network will be able to reason, who seriously think that rigorously."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Because I think it's actually an interesting worldview."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And we'll talk about it more, but it's been impressive what neural networks have been able to accomplish."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And to me, I don't know, you might disagree, but it's an open question whether like scaling size eventually might lead to incredible results to us mere humans will appear as if it's general."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "I mean, if you ask people who are seriously thinking about intelligence, they will definitely not say that all you need to do is, like the mind is just a neural network."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "However, it's actually a view that's very popular, I think, in the deep learning community that many people are kind of conceptually intellectually lazy about it."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Right, it's a, but I guess what I'm saying exactly right, it's, I mean, I haven't met many people and I think it would be interesting to meet a person who is not intellectually lazy about this particular topic and still believes that neural networks will go all the way."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "I think Yama is probably closest to that with self supervised."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "There are definitely people who argue that current deep learning techniques are already the way to general artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "And that all you need to do is to scale it up to all the available trained data."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And that's, if you look at the waves that OpenAI's GPT3 model has made, you see echoes of this idea."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "So on that topic, GPT3, similar to GPT2 actually, have captivated some part of the imagination of the public."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "There's just a bunch of hype of different kind."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "That's, I would say it's emergent."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "It's not artificially manufactured."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "It's just like people just get excited for some strange reason."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "And in the case of GPT3, which is funny, that there's, I believe, a couple months delay from release to hype."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Maybe I'm not historically correct on that, but it feels like there was a little bit of a lack of hype and then there's a phase shift into hype."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "But nevertheless, there's a bunch of cool applications that seem to captivate the imagination of the public about what this language model that's trained in unsupervised way without any fine tuning is able to achieve."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So what do you make of that?"}, {"time": 2600, "text": "What are your thoughts about GPT3?"}, {"time": 2602, "text": "Yeah, so I think what's interesting about GPT3 is the idea that it may be able to learn new tasks after just being shown a few examples."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So I think if it's actually capable of doing that, that's novel and that's very interesting and that's something we should investigate."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "That said, I must say, I'm not entirely convinced that we have shown it's capable of doing that."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "It's very likely, given the amount of data that the model is trained on, that what it's actually doing is pattern matching a new task you give it with a task that it's been exposed to in its trained data."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "It's just recognizing the task instead of just developing a model of the task, right?"}, {"time": 2645, "text": "But there's, sorry to interrupt, there's a parallel as to what you said before, which is it's possible to see GPT3 as like the prompts it's given as a kind of SQL query into this thing that it's learned, similar to what you said before, which is language is used to query the memory."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So is it possible that neural network is a giant memorization thing, but then if it gets sufficiently giant, it'll memorize sufficiently large amounts of things in the world or it becomes, or intelligence becomes a querying machine?"}, {"time": 2680, "text": "I think it's possible that a significant chunk of intelligence is this giant associative memory."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "I definitely don't believe that intelligence is just a giant associative memory, but it may well be a big component."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "So do you think GPT3, 4, 5, GPT10 will eventually, like, what do you think, where's the ceiling?"}, {"time": 2708, "text": "Do you think you'll be able to reason?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "No, that's a bad question."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "Like, what is the ceiling is the better question."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "How well is it gonna scale?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "How good is GPTN going to be?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "So I believe GPTN is gonna."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "GPTN."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "Is gonna improve on the strength of GPT2 and 3, which is it will be able to generate, you know, ever more plausible text in context."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Just monotonically increasing performance."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Yes, if you train a bigger model on more data, then your text will be increasingly more context aware and increasingly more plausible in the same way that GPT3 is much better at generating plausible text compared to GPT2."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "But that said, I don't think just scaling up the model to more transformer layers and more trained data is gonna address the flaws of GPT3, which is that it can generate plausible text, but that text is not constrained by anything else other than plausibility."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So in particular, it's not constrained by factualness or even consistency, which is why it's very easy to get GPT3 to generate statements that are factually untrue."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Or to generate statements that are even self contradictory."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "Because it's only goal is plausibility, and it has no other constraints."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "It's not constrained to be self consistent, for instance."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And so for this reason, one thing that I thought was very interesting with GPT3 is that you can predetermine the answer it will give you by asking the question in a specific way, because it's very responsive to the way you ask the question."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Since it has no understanding of the content of the question."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "And if you have the same question in two different ways that are basically adversarially engineered to produce certain answer, you will get two different answers, two contradictory answers."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "It's very susceptible to adversarial attacks, essentially."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So in general, the problem with these models, these generative models, is that they are very good at generating plausible text, but that's just not enough."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I think one avenue that would be very interesting to make progress is to make it possible to write programs over the latent space that these models operate on."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "That you would rely on these self supervised models to generate a sort of like pool of knowledge and concepts and common sense."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And then you would be able to write explicit reasoning programs over it."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Because the current problem with GPT3 is that it can be quite difficult to get it to do what you want to do."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "If you want to turn GPT3 into products, you need to put constraints on it."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "You need to force it to obey certain rules."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "So you need a way to program it explicitly."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Yeah, so if you look at its ability to do program synthesis, it generates, like you said, something that's plausible."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Yeah, so if you try to make it generate programs, it will perform well for any program that it has seen in its training data."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "But because program space is not interpretive, right?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "It's not going to be able to generalize to problems it hasn't seen before."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Now that's currently, do you think sort of an absurd, but I think useful, I guess, intuition builder is, you know, the GPT3 has 175 billion parameters."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "Human brain has 100, has about a thousand times that or more in terms of number of synapses."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Do you think, obviously, very different kinds of things, but there is some degree of similarity."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "Do you think, what do you think GPT will look like when it has 100 trillion parameters?"}, {"time": 2974, "text": "You think our conversation might be in nature different?"}, {"time": 2979, "text": "Like, because you've criticized GPT3 very effectively now."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "So to begin with, the bottleneck with scaling up GPT3, GPT models, generative pre trained transformer models, is not going to be the size of the model or how long it takes to train it."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "The bottleneck is going to be the trained data because OpenAI is already training GPT3 on a core of basically the entire web, right?"}, {"time": 3008, "text": "And that's a lot of data."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So you could imagine training on more data than that, like Google could train on more data than that, but it would still be only incrementally more data."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And I don't recall exactly how much more data GPT3 was trained on compared to GPT2, but it's probably at least like a hundred, maybe even a thousand X. I don't have the exact number."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "You're not going to be able to train a model on a hundred more data than what you're already doing."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So it's easier to think of compute as a bottleneck and then arguing that we can remove that bottleneck."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But we can remove the compute bottleneck."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I don't think it's a big problem."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "If you look at the pace at which we've improved the efficiency of deep learning models in the past few years, I'm not worried about train time bottlenecks or model size bottlenecks."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "The bottleneck in the case of these generative transformer models is absolutely the trained data."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "What about the quality of the data?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So the quality of the data is an interesting point."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "The thing is, if you're going to want to use these models in real products, then you want to feed them data that's as high quality, as factual, I would say as unbiased as possible, that there's not really such a thing as unbiased data in the first place."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "But you probably don't want to train it on Reddit, for instance."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "It sounds like a bad plan."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "So from my personal experience, working with large scale deep learning models."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "So at some point I was working on a model at Google that's trained on 350 million labeled images."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's an image classification model."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "That's a lot of images."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "That's like probably most publicly available images on the web at the time."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And it was a very noisy data set because the labels were not originally annotated by hand, by humans."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "They were automatically derived from like tags on social media, or just keywords in the same page as the image was found and so on."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So it was very noisy."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "And it turned out that you could easily get a better model, not just by training, like if you train on more of the noisy data, you get an incrementally better model, but you very quickly hit diminishing returns."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "On the other hand, if you train on smaller data set with higher quality annotations, quality annotations that are actually made by humans, you get a better model."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And it also takes less time to train it."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "It's the self supervised learning."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "There's a way to get better doing the automated labeling."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Yeah, so you can enrich or refine your labels in an automated way."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Do you have a hope for, I don't know if you're familiar with the idea of a semantic web."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Is a semantic web just for people who are not familiar and is the idea of being able to convert the internet or be able to attach like semantic meaning to the words on the internet, the sentences, the paragraphs, to be able to convert information on the internet or some fraction of the internet into something that's interpretable by machines."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "That was kind of a dream for, I think the semantic web papers in the nineties, it's kind of the dream that, you know, the internet is full of rich, exciting information."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "Even just looking at Wikipedia, we should be able to use that as data for machines."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And so far it's not, it's not really in a format that's available to machines."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "So no, I don't think the semantic web will ever work simply because it would be a lot of work, right?"}, {"time": 3248, "text": "To make, to provide that information in structured form."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "And there is not really any incentive for anyone to provide that work."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So I think the way forward to make the knowledge on the web available to machines is actually something closer to unsupervised deep learning."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "So GPT3 is actually a bigger step in the direction of making the knowledge of the web available to machines than the semantic web was."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "Yeah, perhaps in a human centric sense, it feels like GPT3 hasn't learned anything that could be used to reason."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "But that might be just the early days."}, {"time": 3292, "text": "Yeah, I think that's correct."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "I think the forms of reasoning that you see it perform are basically just reproducing patterns that it has seen in string data."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So of course, if you're trained on the entire web, then you can produce an illusion of reasoning in many different situations."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "But it will break down if it's presented with a novel situation."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "That's the open question between the

the two in a clever way, your model will actually start generalizing much earlier and more effectively than the end to end deep learning model."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "So why would you not go with the more manual engineering oriented approach?"}, {"time": 3827, "text": "Even if you created that system, either the end to end deep learning model system that's running infinite data, or the slightly more human system, I don't think achieving L5 would demonstrate general intelligence or intelligence of any generality at all."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "Again, the only possible test of

airplane."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And that gives you a measure of how intelligent that system really is."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, that's a big leap."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "I get you."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "But I'm more interested, as a problem, I would see, to me, driving is a black box that can generate novel situations at some rate, what people call edge cases."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "So it does have newness that keeps being like, we're confronted, let's say, once a month."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "It is a very long tail, yes."}, {"time": 3900,

skill, you need a human engineer to write down a bunch of rules that cover most or every possible situation."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "Likewise, the system is not intelligent."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "The system is merely the output artifact of a process that happens in the minds of the engineers that are creating it."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "It is encoding an abstraction that's produced by the human mind."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "And intelligence would actually be the process of autonomously producing this abstraction."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "Not like if you take an abstraction and you encode it on a piece of paper or in a computer program, the abstraction itself is not intelligent."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "What's intelligent is the agent that's capable of producing these abstractions."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "Yeah, it feels like there's a little bit of a gray area."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "Because you're basically saying that deep learning forms abstractions, too."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "But those abstractions do not seem to be effective for generalizing far outside of the things that it's already seen."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "But generalize a little bit."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "No, deep learning does generalize a little bit."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "Generalization is not binary."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "It's more like a spectrum."},

guess exactly what you were saying is intelligence is how efficiently you're able to generalize far outside of the distribution of things you've seen already."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "So it's both the distance of how far you can, how new, how radically new something is, and how efficiently you're able to deal with that."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So you can think of intelligence as a measure of an information conversion ratio."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Imagine a space of possible situations."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "And you've covered some of them."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So you have some amount of information about your space of possible situations that's provided by the situations you already know."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And that's, on the other hand, also provided by the prior knowledge that the system brings to the table, the prior knowledge embedded in the system."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "So the system starts with some information about the problem, about the task."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And it's about going from that information to a program, what we would call a skill program, a behavioral program, that can cover a large area of possible situation space."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "And essentially, the ratio between that area and the amount of information you start with is intelligence."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "So a very smart agent can make efficient use of very little information about a new problem and very little prior knowledge as well to cover a very large area of potential situations in that problem without knowing what these future new situations are going to be."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "So one of the other big things you talk about in the paper, we've talked about a little bit already, but let's talk about it some more, is the actual tests of intelligence."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "So if we look at human and machine intelligence, do you think tests of intelligence should be different for humans and machines, or how we think about testing of intelligence?"}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Are these fundamentally the same kind of intelligences that we're after, and therefore, the tests should be similar?"}, {"time": 4203, "text": "So if your goal is to create AIs that are more humanlike, then it would be super valuable, obviously, to have a test that's universal, that applies to both AIs and humans, so that you could establish a comparison between the two, that you could tell exactly how intelligent, in terms of human intelligence, a given system is."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So that said, the constraints that apply to artificial intelligence and to human intelligence are very different."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "And your test should account for this difference."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Because if you look at artificial systems, it's always possible for an experimenter to buy arbitrary levels of skill at arbitrary tasks, either by injecting hardcoded prior knowledge into the system via rules and so on that come from the human mind, from the minds of the programmers, and also buying higher levels of skill just by training on more data."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "For instance, you could generate an infinity of different Go games, and you could train a Go playing system that way, but you could not directly compare it to human Go playing skills."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "Because a human that plays Go had to develop that skill in a very constrained environment."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "They had a limited amount of time."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "They had a limited amount of energy."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And of course, this started from a different set of priors."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "This started from innate human priors."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "So I think if you want to compare the intelligence of two systems, like the intelligence of an AI and the intelligence of a human, you have to control for priors."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "You have to start from the same set of knowledge priors about the task, and you have to control for experience, that is to say, for training data."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "So what's priors?"}, {"time": 4334, "text": "So prior is whatever information you have about a given task before you start learning about this task."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "And how's that different from experience?"}, {"time": 4345, "text": "Well, experience is acquired."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "So for instance, if you're trying to play Go, your experience with Go is all the Go games you've played, or you've seen, or you've simulated in your mind, let's say."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "And your priors are things like, well, Go is a game on the 2D grid."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And we have lots of hardcoded priors about the organization of 2D space."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And the rules of how the dynamics of the physics of this game in this 2D space?"}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And the idea that you have what winning is."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And other board games can also share some similarities with Go."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And if you've played these board games, then, with respect to the game of Go, that would be part of your priors about the game."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Well, it's interesting to think about the game of Go is how many priors are actually brought to the table."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "When you look at self play, reinforcement learning based mechanisms that do learning, it seems like the number of priors is pretty low."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "But you're saying you should be expec..."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "There is a 2D special priors in the carbonate."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "But you should be clear at making those priors explicit."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "So in particular, I think if your goal is to measure a humanlike form of intelligence, then you should clearly establish that you want the AI you're testing to start from the same set of priors that humans start with."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So I mean, to me personally, but I think to a lot of people, the human side of things is very interesting."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "So testing intelligence for humans."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "What do you think is a good test of human intelligence?"}, {"time": 4454, "text": "Well, that's the question that psychometrics is interested in."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "There's an entire subfield of psychology that deals with this question."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "So what's psychometrics?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "The psychometrics is the subfield of psychology that tries to measure, quantify aspects of the human mind."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So in particular, our cognitive abilities, intelligence, and personality traits as well."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "So what are, it might be a weird question, but what are the first principles of psychometrics this operates on?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "What are the priors it brings to the table?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "So it's a field with a fairly long history."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "So psychology sometimes gets a bad reputation for not having very reproducible results."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "And psychometrics has actually some fairly solidly reproducible results."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So the ideal goals of the field is a test should be reliable, which is a notion tied to reproducibility."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "It should be valid, meaning that it should actually measure what you say it measures."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "So for instance, if you're saying that you're measuring intelligence, then your test results should be correlated with things that you expect to be correlated with intelligence like success in school or success in the workplace and so on."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Should be standardized, meaning that you can administer your tests to many different people in some conditions."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "And it should be free from bias."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Meaning that, for instance, if your test involves the English language, then you have to be aware that this creates a bias against people who have English as their second language or people who can't speak English at all."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So of course, these principles for creating psychometric tests are very much an ideal."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "I don't think every psychometric test is really either reliable, valid, or free from bias."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "But at least the field is aware of these weaknesses and is trying to address them."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "So it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "Ultimately, you're only able to measure, like you said previously, the skill."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "But you're trying to do a bunch of measures of different skills that correlate, as you mentioned, strongly with some general concept of cognitive ability."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "So what's the G factor?"}, {"time": 4606, "text": "So right, there are many different kinds of tests of intelligence."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And each of them is interesting in different aspects of intelligence."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "Some of them will deal with language."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "Some of them will deal with spatial vision, maybe mental rotations, numbers, and so on."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "When you run these very different tests at scale, what you start seeing is that there are clusters of correlations among test results."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "So for instance, if you look at homework at school, you will see that people who do well at math are also likely statistically to do well in physics."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And what's more, people who do well at math and physics are also statistically likely to do well in things that sound completely unrelated, like writing an English essay, for instance."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "And so when you see clusters of correlations in statistical terms, you would explain them with the latent variable."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "And the latent variable that would, for instance, explain the relationship between being good at math and being good at physics would be cognitive ability."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "And the G factor is the latent variable that explains the fact that every test of intelligence that you can come up with results on this test end up being correlated."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So there is some single unique variable that explains these correlations."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "That's the G factor."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So it's a statistical construct."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "It's not really something you can directly measure, for instance, in a person."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "But it's there."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's there at scale."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "And that's also one thing I want to mention about psychometrics."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "Like when you talk about measuring intelligence in humans, for instance, some people get a little bit worried."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "They will say, that sounds dangerous."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "Maybe that sounds potentially discriminatory, and so on."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "And they're not wrong."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "And the thing is, personally, I'm not interested in psychometrics as a way to characterize one individual person."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "Like if I get your psychometric personality assessments or your IQ, I don't think that actually tells me much about you as a person."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "I think psychometrics is most useful as a statistical tool."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "So it's most useful at scale."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "It's most useful when you start getting test results for a large number of people."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "And you start cross correlating these test results."},

scale, psychometrics paints a certain picture of the human mind."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "And that's what's relevant to AI, the structure of human cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "Yeah, it gives you an insight into it."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "I mean, to me, I remember when I learned about G factor, it seemed like it would be impossible for it to be real, even as a statistical variable."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "Like it felt kind of like astrology."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "Like it's like wishful thinking among psychologists."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "But the more I learned, I realized that there's some."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "I mean, I'm not sure what to make about human beings, the fact that the G factor is a thing."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "There's a commonality across all of human species, that there does seem to be a strong correlation between cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "That's kind of fascinating, actually."}, {"time":

intelligence, that encompass a broad set of possible kinds of tasks that are all related."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "And then you have narrow cognitive abilities at the last level, which is closer to task specific skill."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "And there are actually different theories of the structure of cognitive abilities that just emerge from different statistical analysis of IQ test results."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "But they all describe a hierarchy with a kind of G factor at the top."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "And you're right that the G factor, it's not quite real in the

data."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "One thing I want to mention is that the fact that there is a G factor does not really mean that human intelligence is general in a strong sense."}, {"time": 4905,

we're talking about here?"}, {"time": 5892, "text": "Yes, so a researcher has done a lot of work on what exactly are the knowledge priors that are innate to humans is Elizabeth Spelke from Harvard."},

"text": "So that would completely invalidate the test."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "So you're constantly coming up with new stuff."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "Yeah, you need a source of novelty, of unfakeable novelty."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "And one thing I found is that, as a human, you are not a very good source of unfakeable novelty."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "And so you have to base the creation of these tasks quite a bit."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "There are only so many unique tasks that you can do in a given day."}, {"time": 6645, "text": "So that means coming up with truly

about."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "So you would be walking or something like that."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Are you constantly thinking of something totally new?"}, {"time": 6666, "text": "This is hard."}, {"time": 6667, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying you've done anywhere near a perfect job at it."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "There is some amount of redundancy, and there are many

the creation of tasks to a broad audience to do crowdsourcing."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "That would involve several levels of filtering, obviously."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "But I think it's

really exciting for people."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "I think there's a lot of really brilliant people out there that love to create these kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "Yeah, one thing that kind of surprised me that I wasn't expecting is that lots of people seem to actually enjoy ARC as a kind of game."}, {"time": 6785, "text": "And I was releasing it as a test, as a benchmark of fluid general intelligence."}, {"time": 6794, "text": "And lots of people just, including kids, just started enjoying it as a game."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "So I think that's encouraging."},

compelling."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "It's really interesting to me, too."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "One of the cool things about ARC, you said, is kind of inspired by IQ tests or whatever follows a similar process."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "But because of its nature, because of the context in which it lives, it immediately forces you to think about the nature of intelligence as opposed to just the test of your own."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "It forces you to really think."}, {"time": 6846, "text": "I don't know if it's within the question, inherent in the question, or just the fact that it lives in the test that's supposed to be a test of machine intelligence."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "As you solve ARC tasks as a human, you will be forced to basically introspect how you come up with solutions."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And that forces you to reflect on the human problem solving process."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "And the way your own mind generates abstract representations of the problems it's exposed to."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "I think it's due to the fact that the set of core knowledge priors that ARC is built upon is so small."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "It's all a recombination of a very, very small set of assumptions."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "OK, so what's the future of ARC?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "So you held ARC as a challenge, as part of like a Kaggle competition."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "Kaggle competition."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "And what do you think?"}, {"time": 6911, "text": "Do you think that's something that continues for five years, 10 years, like just continues growing?"}, {"time": 6918, "text": "So ARC itself will keep evolving."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "So I've talked about crowdsourcing."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "I think that's a good avenue."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Another thing I'm starting is I'll be collaborating with folks from the psychology department at NYU to do human testing on ARC."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "And I think there are lots of interesting questions you can start asking, especially as you start correlating machine solutions to ARC tasks and the human characteristics of solutions."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "Like for instance, you can try to see if there's a relationship between the human perceived difficulty of a task and the machine perceived."}, {"time": 6959, "text": "Yes, and exactly some measure of machine perceived difficulty."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "Yeah, it's a nice playground in which to explore this very difference."}, {"time": 6966, "text": "It's the same thing as we talked about the autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "The things that could be difficult for humans might be very different than the things that are difficult."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "And formalizing or making explicit that difference in difficulty may teach us something fundamental about intelligence."}, {"time": 6982, "text": "So one thing I think we did well with ARC is that it's proving to be a very actionable test in the sense that machine performance on ARC started at very much zero initially, while humans found actually the task very easy."}, {"time": 7003, "text": "And that alone was like a big red flashing light saying that something is going on and that we are missing something."}, {"time": 7012, "text": "And at the same time, machine performance did not stay at zero for very long."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "Actually, within two weeks of the Kaggle competition, we started having a nonzero number."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "And now the state of the art is around 20% of the test set solved."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "And so ARC is actually a challenge where our capabilities start at zero, which indicates the need for progress."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "But it's also not an impossible challenge."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "It's not accessible."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "You can start making progress basically right away."}, {"time": 7045, "text": "At the same time, we are still very far from having solved it."}, {"time": 7049, "text": "And that's actually a very positive outcome of the competition is that the competition has proven that there was no obvious shortcut to solve these tasks."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "Yeah, so the test held up."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "That was the primary reason to use the Kaggle competition is to check if some clever person was going to hack the benchmark that did not happen."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "People who are solving the task are essentially doing it."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "Well, in a way, they're actually exploring some flaws of ARC that we will need to address in the future, especially they're essentially anticipating what sort of tasks may be contained in the test set."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "Right, which is kind of, yeah, that's the kind of hacking."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "It's human hacking of the test."}, {"time": 7100, "text": "Yes, that said, with the state of the art, it's like 20% we're still very, very far from human level, which is closer to 100%."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "And I do believe that it will take a while until we reach human parity on ARC."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "And that by the time we have human parity, we will have AI systems that are probably pretty close to human level in terms of general fluid intelligence, which is, I mean, they are not going to be necessarily human like."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "They're not necessarily, you would not necessarily recognize them as being an AGI."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "But they would be capable of a degree of generalization that matches the generalization performed by human fluid intelligence."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "I mean, this is a good point in terms of general fluid intelligence to mention in your paper."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "You describe different kinds of generalizations, local, broad, extreme."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "And there's a kind of a hierarchy that you form."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So when we say generalizations, what are we talking about?"}, {"time": 7171, "text": "What kinds are there?"}, {"time": 7173, "text": "Right, so generalization is a very old idea."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "I mean, it's even older than machine learning."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "In the context of machine learning, you say a system generalizes if it can make sense of an input it has not yet seen."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "And that's what I would call system centric generalization, generalization with respect to novelty for the specific system you're considering."}, {"time": 7202, "text": "So I think a good test of intelligence should actually deal with developer aware generalization, which is slightly stronger than system centric generalization."}, {"time": 7213, "text": "So developer aware generalization would be the ability to generalize to novelty or uncertainty that not only the system itself has not access to, but the developer of the system could not have access to either."}, {"time": 7229, "text": "That's a fascinating meta definition."}, {"time": 7232, "text": "So the system is basically the edge case thing we're talking about with autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Neither the developer nor the system know about the edge cases in my encounter."}, {"time": 7244, "text": "So it's up to the system should be able to generalize the thing that nobody expected, neither the designer of the training data, nor obviously the contents of the training data."}, {"time": 7259, "text": "That's a fascinating definition."}, {"time": 7260, "text": "So you can see degrees of generalization as a spectrum."}, {"time": 7264, "text": "And the lowest level is what machine learning is trying to do is the assumption that any new situation is going to be sampled from a static distribution of possible situations and that you already have a representative sample of the distribution."}, {"time": 7282, "text": "That's your training data."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "And so in machine learning, you generalize to a new sample from a known distribution."}, {"time": 7288, "text": "And the ways in which your new sample will be new or different are ways that are already understood by the developers of the system."}, {"time": 7299, "text": "So you are generalizing to known unknowns for one specific task."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "That's what you would call robustness."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "You are robust to things like noise, small variations, and so on for one fixed known distribution that you know through your training data."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "And the higher degree would be flexibility in machine intelligence."}, {"time": 7326, "text": "So flexibility would be something like an L5 cell driving car or maybe a robot that can pass the coffee cup test, which is the notion that you'd be given a random kitchen somewhere in the country."}, {"time": 7342, "text": "And you would have to go make a cup of coffee in that kitchen."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "So flexibility would be the ability to deal with unknown unknowns, so things that could not, dimensions of viability that could not have been possibly foreseen by the creators of the system within one specific task."}, {"time": 7362, "text": "So generalizing to the long tail of situations in self driving, for instance, would be flexibility."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "So you have robustness, flexibility, and finally, you would have extreme generalization, which is basically flexibility, but instead of just considering one specific domain, like driving or domestic robotics, you're considering an open ended range of possible domains."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "So a robot would be capable of extreme generalization if, let's say, it's designed and trained for cooking, for instance."}, {"time": 7399, "text": "And if I buy the robot and if it's able to teach itself gardening in a couple of weeks, it would be capable of extreme generalization, for instance."}, {"time": 7412, "text": "So the ultimate goal is extreme generalization."}, {"time": 7414, "text": "So creating a system that is so general that it could essentially achieve human skill parity over arbitrary tasks and arbitrary domains with the same level of improvisation and adaptation power as humans when it encounters new situations."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "And it would do so over basically the same range of possible domains and tasks as humans and using essentially the same amount of training experience of practice as humans would require."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "That would be human level extreme generalization."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "So I don't actually think humans are anywhere near the optimal intelligence bounds if there is such a thing."}, {"time": 7461, "text": "So I think for humans or in general?"}, {"time": 7465, "text": "I think it's quite likely that there is a hard limit to how intelligent any system can be."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "But at the same time, I don't think humans are anywhere near that limit."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "Yeah, last time I think we talked, I think you had this idea that we're only as intelligent as the problems we face."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "Sort of we are bounded by the problems."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "We are bounded by our environments, and we are bounded by the problems we try to solve."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "What do you make of Neuralink and outsourcing some of the brain power, like brain computer interfaces?"}, {"time": 7507, "text": "Do you think we can expand or augment our intelligence?"}, {"time": 7513, "text": "I am fairly skeptical of neural interfaces because they are trying to fix one specific bottleneck in human machine cognition, which is the bandwidth bottleneck, input and output of information in the brain."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "And my perception of the problem is that bandwidth is not at this time a bottleneck at all."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "Meaning that we already have sensors that enable us to take in far more information than what we can actually process."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "Well, to push back on that a little bit, to sort of play devil's advocate a little bit, is if you look at the internet, Wikipedia, let's say Wikipedia, I would say that humans, after the advent of Wikipedia, are much more intelligent."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "Yes, I think that's a good one."}, {"time": 7567, "text": "But that's also not about, that's about externalizing our intelligence via information processing systems, external information processing systems, which is very different from brain computer interfaces."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "Right, but the question is whether if we have direct access, if our brain has direct access to Wikipedia without Your brain already has direct access to Wikipedia."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "It's on your phone."}, {"time": 7595, "text": "And you have your hands and your eyes and your ears and so on to access that information."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "And the speed at which you can access it Is bottlenecked by the cognition."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "I think it's already close, fairly close to optimal, which is why speed reading, for instance, does not work."}, {"time": 7613, "text": "The faster you read, the less you understand."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "But maybe it's because it uses the eyes."}, {"time": 7620, "text": "So I don't believe so."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "I think the brain is very slow."},

potentially take entire seconds, right?"}, {"time": 7636, "text": "And you can already read pretty fast."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "So I think the speed at which you can take information in and even the speed at which you can output information can only be very incrementally improved."}, {"time": 7649, "text": "Maybe there's a question."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "If you're a very fast typer, if you're a very trained typer, the speed at which you can express your thoughts is already the speed at which you can form your thoughts."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "Right, so that's kind of an idea that there are fundamental bottlenecks to the human mind."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "But it's possible that everything we have in the human mind is just to be able to survive in the environment."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "And there's a lot more to expand."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "Maybe, you know, you said the speed of the thought."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "So I think augmenting human intelligence is a very valid and very powerful avenue, right?"}, {"time": 7689, "text": "And that's what computers are about."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "In fact, that's what all of culture and

beyond the capability of the human brain."}, {"time": 7725, "text": "And you could see civilization itself is it has capabilities that are far beyond any individual brain and will keep scaling it

10."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "And so they have 10 years of life experience."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "They've gotten pain, pleasure, rewards, and punishment in a period of time."}, {"time": 8634,

efficiency in our models."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "But they are not perfectly compressed because they need to include things that are seemingly useless today, that have seemingly been useless so far."}, {"time": 8660, "text": "But that may turn out to be useful in the future because you just don't know the future."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "And that's the fundamental principle that cognition,

instance."}, {"time": 8694, "text": "If I look at the past 20 years of stock market data, and I use a compression algorithm to figure out the best trading strategy, it's going to be you buy Apple

to be following, you're going to have a balanced portfolio, right?"}, {"time": 8734, "text": "Because you just don't know what's going to happen."}, {"time": 8738, "text": "I mean, I guess in that

being able to generalize in the local sense."}, {"time": 8753, "text": "That's why as humans, when we are children, in our education, so a lot of it is driven by play, driven by curiosity."}, {"time":
