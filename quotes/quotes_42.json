a human being is equal."}, {"time": 359, "text": "It's just literally the worth of a human being."}, {"time": 362, "text": "So I mentioned to you offline that I came from the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 366, "text": "My grandfather fought in World War II, and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person as they were captured, there's different numbers, but it's in the hundreds to one German in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany."}, {"time": 390, "text": "So he wanted Germany to expand and conquer a large part of the world."}, {"time": 394, "text": "And within that future world, that Third Reich, the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person, of a pure German person."}, {"time": 407, "text": "So that has to do with not some kind of public policy or politics or all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 413, "text": "It has to do with the basic worth of a human being."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And that's what Dr. King is speaking to, that all people on some kind of deep level are worth the same."}, {"time": 427, "text": "If you're somehow weighing the value of a person, we're equal in that basic fundamental worth."}, {"time": 436, "text": "I think that's very well said."}, {"time": 438, "text": "I don't know that he had in mind the position of Slavic people in Central Europe in the middle of the 20th century, or the first part of the 20th century, King."}, {"time": 447, "text": "I don't know that he had that in mind."}, {"time": 449, "text": "He might well have done."}, {"time": 451, "text": "But certainly that's the idea."}, {"time": 454, "text": "So you don't think he was really thinking about this particular civil rights struggle and the particular struggle against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America and thinking about African Americans."}, {"time": 469, "text": "He wasn't thinking about the basic, he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings."}, {"time": 475, "text": "No, I don't mean to say that."}, {"time": 476, "text": "The speech in Washington."}, {"time": 480, "text": "The dream."}, {"time": 481, "text": "In 1963 at that march was within the context of the United States."}, {"time": 488, "text": "And it was within the context of the civil rights movement."}, {"time": 492, "text": "There was a movement that was going on."}, {"time": 495, "text": "He was an actor in a political drama that was American that had to do with the fight over equal rights for voting, for housing, for employment, for citizenship of blacks in America."}, {"time": 514, "text": "But King was informed, I think, by a much broader Christian ethic of the equality of all persons."}, {"time": 524, "text": "I mean, he gets killed in 1968."}, {"time": 528, "text": "The five years after that speech in Washington, he spends developing his worldview and the things that he had to say, for example, about the war in Southeast Asia that was going on at that time made appeals to universal principles of equality."}, {"time": 551, "text": "He was a pacifist to some degree."}, {"time": 553, "text": "He was against war."}, {"time": 555, "text": "He was a socialist to some degree."}, {"time": 558, "text": "He might not have worn that label publicly, but he believed in a decent society where the poor would not go untended, where healthcare would be available to people who needed it and this kind of thing."}, {"time": 572, "text": "A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life was not dependent upon the color of the skin, upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken, upon whether male or female."}, {"time": 588, "text": "All persons are created equal."}, {"time": 590, "text": "This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King, on my understanding."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature by looking at the history of slavery in America?"}, {"time": 608, "text": "So what does that tell you about people?"}, {"time": 610, "text": "Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head."}, {"time": 615, "text": "One is about the capacity of people for looking the other way in the face of unethical and morally profoundly problematic practice."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So, I mean, slavery was controversial."}, {"time": 640, "text": "It was controversial going all the way back to the founding of the United States of America."}, {"time": 644, "text": "The country was founded on a compromise where half of the country thought that slavery was abhorrent and would not have had it countenanced in the Constitution."}, {"time": 659, "text": "The other half of the country were steeped in the dependence on the labor of these African captives and their descendants."}, {"time": 668, "text": "The economy depended upon it."}, {"time": 670, "text": "They owned them as property."}, {"time": 671, "text": "That was their wealth."}, {"time": 672, "text": "Their wealth was invested to some degree in the value of these human beings."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And in order for the United States to come together as a confederation of the several colonies, there had to be a compromise made."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist and the people who were against it or who thought it morally problematic were able to countenance the practice in the Southern states where slavery flourished."}, {"time": 705, "text": "And that went on for 75 years after the founding of the country until the crisis of the late 1850s that led to the Civil War and ultimately to the emancipation."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So one thing I think about human nature from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people to live with terrible, morally questionable practices and have that as a part of their institutions."}, {"time": 734, "text": "It took a movement, a massive movement of abolitionists struggling against slavery for the better part of a century before that practice could be eradicated."}, {"time": 749, "text": "But the other thing about human nature that I see is the ability of people to sustain their humanity under the most awful, oppressive conditions."}, {"time": 764, "text": "The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children, I mean, they were chattel, they were bought and sold like horses or cattle."}, {"time": 776, "text": "And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that."}, {"time": 825, "text": "So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil but human nature can also survive in the face of terrible evil."}, {"time": 838, "text": "That's what I take from slavery."}, {"time": 840, "text": "That survival, that flame can burn even when the world around it tries to put it out."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's still a little flame of human consciousness, of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful that lives on."}, {"time": 861, "text": "That's very well said."}, {"time": 862, "text": "Yeah, I think you put it very well."}, {"time": 863, "text": "There's gotta be some poetic way of expressing that."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Leave it to the poets."}, {"time": 871, "text": "What about the people that look the other way?"}, {"time": 874, "text": "How many people do you think, just regular people, knew that something is, this is wrong?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "Or do people through generations convince themselves, most people, most regular people, convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?"}, {"time": 893, "text": "I ask this question because I wonder what we're looking the other way on today also."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Because you have to ask yourself these difficult questions of assuming we're the same people we were back then then we can be flawed in that same kind of way."}, {"time": 914, "text": "We can look the other way just as others have in history."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Yeah, you spoke of the European context and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people had to be looking the other way when the massive crimes that were committed by that regime were being undertaken."}, {"time": 936, "text": "I mean, railroad cars full of human beings being taken off to be slaughtered or to be worked to death in labor camps or to be gassed, et cetera."}, {"time": 948, "text": "A lot of people had to know about what was going on and look the other way or enthusiastically supported the persecution of the Jews and the gypsies and so on."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840."}, {"time": 965, "text": "My sense of the matter is that like many practices that are unjust, most people thought that's just the way it is."}, {"time": 974, "text": "I mean, that's the world that they inherited."}, {"time": 976, "text": "They were not moralists, they were not revolutionaries."}, {"time": 980, "text": "They just wanted to go along."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Some people might've been troubled by it but thought there's nothing that can be done."}, {"time": 986, "text": "Some people might've thought, well, they're these black Africans, they're not really like us and they are lucky to be here."}, {"time": 995, "text": "If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still."}, {"time": 998, "text": "Some people might've thought that."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Some people might've been disturbed but not been able to see what it is that they could do about it."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "They might've thought, oh, this is disgusting."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "This is not something I would wanna have anything to do with but not knowing whether there's any practical way of opposing it, that's why you need a movement."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You need for the people who are troubled by the practice to know that there are others like themselves equally troubled and as they gather together, collectively, they can exert their influence."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery, as I say, go all the way back to the founding of the country."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "There were abolitionists and there were people who opposed the compromise that led to the framing documents and institutions that created the United States of America, opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "But it took a while before that could come to a head and produce the crisis which ultimately led to the eradication of slavery."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "I would note that slavery is not unique to the United States."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "It's not unique to the Western Hemisphere."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "The enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel is something that one sees on a global basis, one sees it going all the way back to antiquity."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So we might ask, how is it that people finally came to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So I mean, I'd like to make this point sometimes when people are talking about how wrong slavery was and I agree without any question that the practice was profoundly morally problematic, but I'd like to make the point that given how wrong it was, think about how impressive was the accomplishment of the eradication of slavery."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "Now, that was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865 in a country of 30 million people."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives not to eradicate slavery in every instance, probably most of them were just fighting for, they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces and they fought and they died, but the net effect of their having fought and died was to push along a process that led to the eradication of slavery."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "The slaves themselves were largely uneducated and backward in their, of course, what else could they have been?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Now, he did not descend from slaves, I think we must not lose track of that, but he identified as an African American and was a part of the population that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves and we are, we African Americans are for all practical purposes, fully equal citizens of this great republic."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "That has happened within a century and a half and I don't know that you can find any parallel to that kind of transformation in the status of people from human chattel to full citizens of the republic."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Anywhere in human history, it's certainly worth celebrating the achievement of the eradication of slavery, I would say."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And it probably started with a few people that inside their mind dared to rebel."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "You know, it's interesting to think about how it all started, how in the state of injustice, the revolution percolates, like where it starts."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "You said people that see something is wrong find each other."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "It's in the ideas of charismatic individuals that not only know that something is wrong, but are able to tell others about it and be convincing and then together gather and rise up."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress from slavery to where we are today to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "The power of individual, because I don't know what you think about it, but I tend to think that a few small individuals probably originated this."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "Like it's the power of the individual, because sometimes we think there's injustice in the world, what can I possibly do?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "But I tend to think one person can be the seed of starting to fix the injustice."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "One person here, one person there."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "And I mean, he's just one person, but there were others like him."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Just one person."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "All it takes is just one person."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "So here we are on this topic of equality in the 21st century."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So what does equality mean today?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome or the injustice of inequality, at which point does equality of outcome is just, at which point is it unjust?"}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Sort of looking at our world today and looking at inequality, how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice and some is the way of life?"}, {"time": 1516, "text": "So what does equality mean when we look at the world today, different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I don't think King's speech, I have a dream that one day my four little children will be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character requires equality of outcome."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "He says his children will be judged by the content of their character."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "That's a conditional statement."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea that groups will be equal in all of the various social outcomes, that they will be equally successful in business, that they will be proportionately represented in the various professions, that they will have the same educational achievement, that the occupational profiles will look the same."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "They have different norms within their own cultural practice."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "How would we expect, if in fact we recognize that the groups are different from one another, that in a world that is fair, they would all come out equally represented in every undertaking."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "They're not equally represented, and that fact, I'm arguing, is in and of itself insufficient to justify the conclusion that they're not somehow being fairly treated."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes in a world in which the populations in question are themselves different with respect to their culture, their practices, their norms, their traditions, their beliefs, their ideals, and so on."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs, cultural orientations, and ideals will have consequences in terms of their different social outcomes."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "So I just think it's a mistake that people are making when they think fairness of treatment implies equality of outcomes."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Is the process by which we're speaking now in the midst of the National Basketball Association's playoffs, I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "I mean, I'm just, it's a very good team, and I'm excited about my Celtics."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "We defeated the Brooklyn Nets."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and company, okay, in a playoff series."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "We whipped them, and we're on our way to the Eastern Conference Finals, and we're on our way to the NBA Finals, and I'm, you know, if I were a betting man, I'd put down a few bucks that the Boston Celtics, underrated as we are, have a very good chance of winning the NBA Finals."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Okay, so that's the NBA."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "That's the National Basketball Association."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "I'm a sports fan."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "I like basketball."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Slightly biased prediction, but yes."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Yeah, it is somewhat biased."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "All I'm saying is, if you take a look at who the star players are in the National Basketball Association, you're gonna find that there's some Eastern Europeans."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "You know, there's some really good basketball players coming out of Eastern Europe, and more power to them, and there are a lot of African Americans."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "We're overrepresented."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "There are not that many Jews, as far as I know."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "No offense intended there, Lex, but I mean, the NBA is not equally representative of all of the different populations in the United States."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Now, we could go into the reasons why, but I'm just saying the process by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "If you can play, you can get on the court."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "All they're looking for is people who can play."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "I think something like that is true in many different venues."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "I expect, if you're a really good technical engineer, companies are gonna employ you, and if you can make money, they're gonna advance you, and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "I expect that the people who are engaged in financial transactions, who are actually making bets on the market, by and large, are the people who are good at that activity, and if you're good at that activity in this world, in this modern world, you're gonna rise to the top."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "Of course, there are of many different sorts, but I'm saying that to expect that there would be, okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Let's look at who's actually trading bonds."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "Let's look at who's actually starting businesses and so on."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "To say that in a fair world, I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population, they'd be 10% of every one of those things, is to ignore the reality that the differences in the culture and practices and norms of the various population groups will lead to differences in their representation amongst people who are outstanding performers in one or another activity."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "How do you know if the difference in culture accounts for the difference in outcomes, or it's the existence of barriers, especially barriers early on in life, of discrimination that are racially based?"}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So if you think about affirmative action, in which ways is affirmative action empowering, in which way is it limiting for these early development of different groups, but let's just speak to African Americans."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "We should say that you went to some no name Northwestern University at first, but then you ended up with the great university of MIT."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So that's your, not early, but middle development."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "So speaking of the development, the opportunities, the equality of opportunity, how do we know we got that equality right?"}, {"time": 1997, "text": "Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "We were talking about results, now we're talking about opportunity."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "I was taking the position that when King says, I have a dream and he envisions a world where his children will not be barred from the good things in life because of the color of their skin, we're talking about opportunity, not about results."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "But opportunity is not just something that depends upon what the law is and what public policies are."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions in which people are raised, the social and economic conditions."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So the child of a poor family that has no resources, it doesn't have the same opportunity as a child of a wealthy family to realize their full human potential."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "You asked me, how can we tell whether or not a difference in outcomes is a reflection of unequal opportunity, or it's a reflection of differences in culture and interest and practice?"}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And I don't know that there's a single answer to that question, but I think one wants to look at the data, one wants to try to measure."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "As a social scientist, I would say what you wanna do is you wanna estimate the significance of various factors for determining the outcome."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "If the outcome is how much money does a person make when they work in the labor market?"}, {"time": 2093, "text": "So you look at their wages and you think, well, that depends upon a number of things."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "It depends upon how educated they are, what kind of skills they have, what kind of work experience they have, and so on."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "And those things are all legitimate factors that might determine how much they end up making in the labor market."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "But you also wanna perhaps, controlling for those things, see whether or not the fact that they are black or they are Latino or whatever, fact that they are male or that they are female, the fact that they do or do not speak English as their native language, this kind of thing, whether those factors also are implicated in determining how successful they are in the labor market."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "But I wanna focus a little bit more here on what we mean by opportunity because it's not just whether employers treat the worker on a fair and even basis, irregardless of the worker's racial or ethnic background."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "That's one opportunity issue, but that's at the end of the development process."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "They are now presenting themselves to the market, trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "That's the end of the line."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "What about the developmental opportunity, the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?"}, {"time": 2218, "text": "That goes all the way back, that goes all the way back to birth."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "It even goes back to before birth."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Or the mother carrying the infant in the womb, she has certain nutritional practices as she might be smoking or drinking alcohol or something like that."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "I'm not saying she is, I'm not saying she isn't, I'm just saying whether she is or she isn't that will affect the development of the fetus."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "The newborn, now there's a question of environment."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "There's a question of the development of their neurological potential."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "Do they learn how to read?"}, {"time": 2260, "text": "Are they stimulated verbally?"}, {"time": 2262, "text": "How many words have they heard spoken?"}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Are they being nurtured in a home environment so as to maximize the possibility of them achieving their human potential?"}, {"time": 2275, "text": "What about the peer group influences?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "What about the values and norms of the surrounding human communities in which they're embedded?"}, {"time": 2285, "text": "Do they encourage the young person to apply themselves in a systematic way to their studies and to their focus on their acquisition of language command and of their educational potential?"}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So development is not only something that is controlled by the society's practices, it's also something that is influenced by the cultural background of the individual."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "And those things are not equal."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "Those things vary across groups in a very significant way."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "And that too will be a factor determining disparities of outcome."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "So when I see outcomes that are different, I see wealth holding that's different."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "I see educational achievement that's different."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "I see representation in the professional schools and law school and medical school that's different between groups."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "One question is are the institutions treating people fairly?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "But another question is do the background in social and cultural influences equip people in the same way?"}, {"time": 2360, "text": "And we know that the answer to that, not in every instance do they equip people in the same way."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "And so it makes the judgment, the moral judgment that we make when we see inequality of outcome complicated."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree, but it is also a cultural factor to some degree, I wanna say, and that's controversial, I know."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "A lot of people, they think of themselves as being progressive."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "They wanna point a finger at society whenever they see a disparity."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "But I think that that's a mistake."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "You think that if you get the right law, if you have the right public policy, if the right politicians are elected to office, suddenly those disparities will go away."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "But I mean, we could go into that."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "You were talking about affirmative action, which is something else altogether."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And you were talking about me and my education, which is also something that's a little bit different."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And I'm happy to talk about those things."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Northwestern University, by the way, was a great university."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "I'm just joking, it's one of the great universities of the world, yes."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University, which is how I ended up at MIT in the first
