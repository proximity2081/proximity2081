[{"title": "Vincent Racaniello: Viruses and Vaccines | Lex Fridman Podcast #216", "id": "G433fa01oMU", "quotes": [{"time": 300, "text": "So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31, but just in the ocean."}, {"time": 304, "text": "And that number is so big."}, {"time": 306, "text": "First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants on the planet by a thousand fold."}, {"time": 312, "text": "And if you lined up those viruses end to end, they would go 200 million light years into space."}, {"time": 319, "text": "It's so big a number."}, {"time": 323, "text": "And then yes, 10 to the 20 some infections per second of these viruses killing bacteria and releasing all this organic matter."}, {"time": 332, "text": "And that's part of this, what we call the biogeochemical pump, cycling of material in the ocean."}, {"time": 339, "text": "The bacteria die, they start to sink and then they get metabolized and converted to compounds that are needed."}, {"time": 348, "text": "A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth."}, {"time": 350, "text": "So these are actually really important cycles that are catalyzed by the virus."}, {"time": 354, "text": "Well, it's so wild that nature has developed a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria."}, {"time": 359, "text": "That's one way to look at it, but it's just what happened, right?"}, {"time": 363, "text": "I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage of like such fast cycling of life is."}, {"time": 370, "text": "Is it just an accident of evolution that viruses are so numerous or is it a feature and not a bug?"}, {"time": 380, "text": "So the fast is, it's not all fast."}, {"time": 385, "text": "Not all viruses are fast."}, {"time": 386, "text": "Some are 20 minutes per cycle."}, {"time": 388, "text": "Some take weeks per cycle, but that's just per second."}, {"time": 393, "text": "There's so many viruses in the ocean that that's what you get per second, no matter how fast the cycle is."}, {"time": 399, "text": "But I look at it this way."}, {"time": 401, "text": "Viruses were probably the first organic entities to evolve on the planet."}, {"time": 408, "text": "Long ago, billion years ago, just as the earth cooled and organic molecules began to form, I think these self, we call them self replicators."}, {"time": 420, "text": "They're just short things that today, would look like RNA, which is the basis of many viruses."}, {"time": 427, "text": "They evolved and they were able to replicate."}, {"time": 429, "text": "Of course, they were just naked molecules."}, {"time": 432, "text": "They had no protection and it was just RNA based."}, {"time": 436, "text": "And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world."}, {"time": 440, "text": "And it probably didn't get very big as a consequence."}, {"time": 444, "text": "But then proteins evolved and I'm skipping like hundreds of millions of years of evolution."}, {"time": 450, "text": "Proteins evolved, maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But then to make a cell, there probably were some RNA based cells early on, but they were pretty simple."}, {"time": 462, "text": "But the cells that we know of today, even bacteria and single celled eukaryotes, they have very long DNA genomes."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell."}, {"time": 474, "text": "And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA, which we now know today as reverse transcriptase, which my former boss, David Baltimore and Howard Temin co discovered."}, {"time": 494, "text": "And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And then you could build big cells with DNA because DNA can be millions and millions of bases in length and RNA, the longest RNA we know of is 40,000 bases, not much bigger than the SARS CoV2."}, {"time": 512, "text": "What would you say is the magic moment along that line?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "I saw it was one or two billion, maybe three billion years it took to go from bacteria to complex organism."}, {"time": 529, "text": "It seems like Earth had a very long time, not a very long time without life, and then a very long time with very primitive life."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Maybe I'm discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life."}, {"time": 543, "text": "People would object to you doing that for sure."}, {"time": 546, "text": "But it seems like complex organism when it starts becoming something like, I don't know what's a good, not animal like, but more complexity than just like a single cell."}, {"time": 557, "text": "What do you think is the magic there?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "What's the hardest thing?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life and build the simulations, obviously we're living in a video game, what this is."}, {"time": 567, "text": "So if you were trying to build this video game, what's the hardest part along this evolution?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "Bacteria are mostly single cells."}, {"time": 576, "text": "They do make colonies."}, {"time": 577, "text": "They get together in biofilms, which are really important."}, {"time": 581, "text": "But they're all single bacteria in that."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And the key is making an organism where cells do different things."}, {"time": 589, "text": "We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells."}, {"time": 591, "text": "Bacteria never do that."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And the reason is probably energy."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And so there was another cell existing at the time, the archaea."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea and became the modern day mitochondria, the energy factory of the cell."}, {"time": 614, "text": "And that now led that cell develop into more and more complicated organisms like we have today."}, {"time": 620, "text": "It was all about energy."}, {"time": 621, "text": "So the mitochondria, the energy, the mitochondria is the magic thing."}, {"time": 627, "text": "It's just actually not my idea."}, {"time": 628, "text": "It's Nick Jones."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Have you heard of Nick Jones?"}, {"time": 630, "text": "He's an evolutionary biologist in the UK."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And he's done experimental work on this."}, {"time": 636, "text": "And it's his idea that the defining point was the ability to make a lot of energy, which a mitochondria can do."}, {"time": 643, "text": "It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell."}, {"time": 646, "text": "And that becomes what we now call eukaryotes and that they can get more and more complicated."}, {"time": 651, "text": "So let me bring you back to the viruses."}, {"time": 653, "text": "I wanna finish that story."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Yeah, which points of viruses come along?"}, {"time": 656, "text": "So remember, we have these precellular, they're called precellular replicons, right?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "And so we have a precellular stage where we have these self replicating molecules and then cells arise."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And then the self replicating molecules invade the cells."}, {"time": 676, "text": "Because it's a hospitable environment."}, {"time": 677, "text": "I mean, they didn't know that."}, {"time": 679, "text": "They just went in and it turned out it was beneficial for them, so it stuck."}, {"time": 683, "text": "And they replicate inside the cell now where they have pools of everything they need."}, {"time": 687, "text": "They get more and more complicated."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And then they steal proteins from the cell to build a protective shell."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And then they can be released as virus particles."}, {"time": 696, "text": "They're now protected."}, {"time": 697, "text": "They can move from host to host."}, {"time": 699, "text": "And because they're at the earliest stages of cellular evolution, they can diversify to infect anything that arises."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And that is why I think there's so many of them and everything on the planet is infected because the ancestor of everything was infected many years ago."}, {"time": 717, "text": "So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch."}, {"time": 721, "text": "So it's easier to sort of break into somebody else's thing and steal their proteins."}, {"time": 727, "text": "My colleague, Dixon de Palmier, calls viruses safe crackers."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Safe crackers."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So it's just, from an evolutionary perspective, it's easier to steal because you can select."}, {"time": 740, "text": "But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing, for breaking into, for cracking the state."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Well, you don't have to figure out."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It just happens, right?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Because molecules are so diverse that a molecule gets into a cell and if there's a protein that sticks to it, it's gonna stick and that gives an advantage."}, {"time": 759, "text": "There's no planning."}, {"time": 761, "text": "There's no thinking about it, right?"}, {"time": 764, "text": "Oh, we'll return to that."}, {"time": 766, "text": "Ha ha ha ha ha."}, {"time": 768, "text": "What, but these numbers are crazy."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So what, as these more complex organisms evolved, let's take us humans as an example, should we be afraid of these high numbers?"}, {"time": 781, "text": "Should we be worried that there's so many viruses in the world?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "Well, to a certain extent."}, {"time": 786, "text": "I mean, they have, it's twofold."}, {"time": 788, "text": "They're good and bad, right?"}, {"time": 789, "text": "Viruses are no, there was no question they can be bad."}, {"time": 792, "text": "We know that because they've infected and caused disease throughout history, but we're also, you and I are full of viruses that don't hurt us at all and probably help us and every organism is the same."}, {"time": 802, "text": "So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So I think, so every living thing on the planet has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And most of them I think we don't worry about because they can't infect us."}, {"time": 821, "text": "They're unable."}, {"time": 822, "text": "In fact, now you can actually take your feces and send them to a company and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you, your fecal virome, right?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "And the most common virus in human feces is a plant virus that infects peppers."}, {"time": 840, "text": "It's called pepper model mosaic virus."}, {"time": 843, "text": "And that's because people eat a lot of peppers and it just passes right through you."}, {"time": 846, "text": "Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects that walk on the cabbage in the fields."}, {"time": 850, "text": "We eat them, they just pass us."}, {"time": 853, "text": "So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about except when we're talking about species that are closest to us, mammals, of course."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And I think the most numerous ones are the most concerning, they're viruses like bats."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Bats are 20% of mammals and rodents are 40% of mammals."}, {"time": 873, "text": "And we humans live nearby, right?"}, {"time": 877, "text": "And we know throughout history, many viruses have come from bats and from rodents to people, no question about it."}, {"time": 882, "text": "So there's a proximity in terms of just living together and a proximity genetically too."}, {"time": 886, "text": "So it's more likely that a virus will jump from a bat and a rodent."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And birds too."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Birds can give us their viruses that's happened."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Influenza viruses come from birds mainly."}, {"time": 897, "text": "So I think those are the three species, not species, it's higher than species obviously, but those are the three I would worry about in terms of getting their viruses."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And we don't really know what's out there, right?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "We have very little clue about what viruses, and I've for years wanted to capture wild mice in my backyard and see what viruses they have because no one knows."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And it's an easy."}, {"time": 921, "text": "We can't ask them, so you mean map, like is there a way?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "I can't ask them, yeah."}, {"time": 925, "text": "No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So you can do a thorough sequencing to determine which viruses."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses where you'd be?"}, {"time": 940, "text": "So whenever you do sequence, right?"}, {"time": 942, "text": "You get some environmental sample and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it."}, {"time": 947, "text": "What you do is you run it past the database."}, {"time": 949, "text": "The gold standard is the GenBank database which is maintained here in the US."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And you see if you get any hits."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And then you can say, ah, look, this sequence is similar to this virus."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And you can classify all the viruses you see."}, {"time": 963, "text": "The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter."}, {"time": 969, "text": "It doesn't hit with anything."}, {"time": 971, "text": "It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And that's gonna be hard to figure out because someone's gonna have to go after it and sort it through."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So yes, you can find a lot of viruses and the numbers you get are astounding."}, {"time": 982, "text": "You can find thousands of new viruses just by looking in various life forms."}, {"time": 988, "text": "But there are many more that we don't pick up because they're not in the database."}, {"time": 992, "text": "Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent."}, {"time": 996, "text": "What do you think about Alpha Fold 2?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "I don't know if you've been paying attention to that."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "With them DeepMind solving the protein folding problem and then also releasing, first of all, open sourcing the code, which is for me as a software person, I love."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And then second of all, also making like 300,000 predictions or something like that for different protein structures and releasing that data."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "On the side of, because you're saying there's dark matter."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts, level of excitement about their work?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And second, how can that be applied to viruses?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Do you think we'll be able to explore the dark matter of virology using machine learning?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Because in all this dark sequence, you can translate it and make a protein."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "You can see what a protein looks like."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It has what we call an open reading frame, right?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "A start and a stop."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids, but if we could fold it, maybe the fold would be like something we already know, some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Because there are only so many protein folds in biology and that dark matter is probably one of them."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So I think that's very exciting because for years, I've followed structural biologists for years and in the beginning, we couldn't even solve structures of viruses, they're too big."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "We could do small molecules like myoglobin, that was the first one done, took years to do that."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Then as computational power increased, then they could start to do viruses, but it took a long time."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "X ray crystallography, depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?"}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And now we can do cryo electron microscopy, which is much faster."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "You could solve, the spike of SARS COVID 2 was solved in two months by Jason McClelland here in Austin actually at the beginning of the pandemic, but you're limited, you can't do huge proteins."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "You can only do moderately sized ones."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So, or actually you can do viruses, but you can't do small proteins."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast to solve."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You get a new protein, you wanna solve its structure."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So if we could predict it, and I know from talking to structural biologists, this has been their holy grail from day one."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein, put it in a computer and have the structure put out without having to do all the experiment."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "So that's why this is very exciting that you can predict it."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "That mean it's not finished obviously, and there's more to do, but I think it will be a day where you could take any amino acid sequence and predict what it's gonna look like."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "See, but like aren't structural biologists gonna get greedy?"}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So once you have that, don't you wanna go more complicated then?"}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Don't you wanna go, because that's just the first step, right?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "You go from amino acid to the structure, then there's like multiple protein interactions."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Like how do you get to the virus?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Well, so that's what the ultimate goal of getting a structure is that then you can do experiments and figure out what the structure means, right?"}, {"time": 1182, "text": "So many, in the old days, structural biology was a career in itself."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "You worked with people who had a system and just solve proteins for them, and then you moved on to another one."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "You didn't really do any experiments."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "The other people got to do all the interesting experiments."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "They solve the structure, and then they say, what happens if we change this amino acid?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "This must be the receptor binding interface."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So that's the exciting stuff, absolutely, is doing the experiment."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "Well, I wonder if you can do some kinds of like simulations of like, you know, different proteins or multi protein systems going to war against each other, like to try to figure out, you know, reinforcement learning is used in alpha zero, for example, to learn chess and go, and that's using the self play mechanism where the thing plays against itself and learns better and better."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Whether you can, I wonder if you can simulate almost evolution in that way for primitive biological systems, have them in simulation, fight each other, and then see what comes out, like a super dangerous virus comes out or super like Chuck Norris type of thing that defends against the super dangerous virus, and it's all in simulation."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So an example would be, we have all these variants of SARS COVID 2 arising, right?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Which look to be selected by immune responses, but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike and how they block antibody binding."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "You could simulate that."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "You could say, what is the antibody looking at?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?"}, {"time": 1288, "text": "You could map them all and change them in a simulation one by one and go back and forth between the antibody and the virus."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "The virus changes and then it evades the host and then the host can change."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "It takes geological time, but it can."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And then the virus can change and it can go back and forth."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences of both viruses and their hosts."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And so you can take a protein in a host that is a receptor for multiple viruses and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And you could simulate that for sure."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And that's just one thing that you could do."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "You could simulate changes in say an enzyme that makes it resistant to a drug and predict all the drug resistance."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "But the problem is people like me, the experimental virologists don't know how to do any of that."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So we need to collaborate with people, I guess."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Oh, with other humans."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "We do that, we do that."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But with people from a field that we're not used to, I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Yeah, machine learning people."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Machine learning people."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "And you would say, look, this is the biological problem."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?"}, {"time": 1366, "text": "The problem is those people are antisocial introverts that have a place like this and try to hide from other people in the world."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Very difficult to find in the wild."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "Okay, so outside of doing amazing brilliant lectures online, you host and produce five, I would say, related podcasts, including my favorite, This Week in Virology, also This Week in Parasitism, This Week in Microbiology, and so on."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "So you're a good person to ask, what are the categories of small things, small biological things in this world that can kill you, kill us humans?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Let's look, you said like most viruses are friendly or at least not unfriendly."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "But let's look at the unfriendly ones."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "When you look at the full spectrum of things that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, I think the big picture is that the things that can kill you are a minority of everything that's out there."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And we're talking about molecules."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So we have in us proteins that can kill us."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Preons that are just, it's a protein in us."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And if it misfolds, it makes all of its other copies misfold and then you die of a neurological disease."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "That's pretty rare."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So there are proteins, there are viruses."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And as I said, only certain ones can kill us."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "But even if we get those from animals, it's not straightforward."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "If you look at SARS CoV2, right?"}, {"time": 1466, "text": "This is probably a once in a hundred year pandemic, I would say, equivalent to 1918 in its devastation."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And in between there have been smaller pandemics of other viruses, but it doesn't happen all that often."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "So we have a lot of viruses."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "We have a lot of bacteria of various sorts that can cause infections in us."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And it's a limited number, right?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "You're streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "We could go on and on, but we know how to handle those."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "As long as we have antimicrobials, it's just that we abuse them and we get resistant."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So that can be a problem."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Then we have fungi, not mushrooms, but much smaller fungi that multiply sub microscopic or just at the microscopic level."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "They can, in dry climates of the US, you can inhale their spores and they can grow in your lung if you're immunosuppressed and so forth."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So those are the tiny guys."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And then we have parasites, which we do this week in parasitism, where single cells, even worms of various sorts can invade you and cause all sorts of problems."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "How, I was like kind of terrified to listen to that podcast."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "What's it like?"}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Well, I mean, what you learn is that you can, you travel somewhere and you can get infected and bring it back home."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Here in the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites, but because of our lifestyle, we more or less have

about all the millions and billions of viruses around."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So a virus, we have a very specific definition because it's different from everything else on the planet."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Because first of all, it's a parasite."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It takes, a parasite means you take something from someone else."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "We have human parasites who take money from others, right?"}, {"time": 1896, "text": "But in biological terms, a parasite takes something from the host that the host would otherwise use energy or some building block or something."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "There's never really a symbiotic relationship between a virus and a host."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Well, there can be."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So that's the dichotomy I think is that we define them as parasites, yet I just told you 20 minutes ago that many viruses are probably beneficial."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "So I think what it means is we, at some point we're gonna have to change our definition, right?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Because after all, definitions we make are just constructs that make it easy for us to study, that don't necessarily represent what's right."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first and now it's not a planet anymore and a lot of people are very upset."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "But it's only according to us."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "There may be another race living somewhere else who thinks it's a planet, right?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "They're very angry."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "They're calling them parasites."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "So right now our definition includes parasite because a

divide on their own like bacteria."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "So a virus needs to get inside of a cell, inside the cell, it can't just hang around on the surface."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "It needs to get in in order to make more of itself."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite because it needs to get in a cell and then it takes things from the cell in the form of all kinds of molecules and processes and energy and so forth to make new viruses."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell."}, {"time": 2006, "text":

out."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "Now, why that is, is a good question, but that's the reason why RNA viruses are far more successful."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "They infect many more hosts and they're very, I would say slippery."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "They can change hosts really quickly, because in any animal harboring an RNA virus, like let's say a bat in some cave somewhere, it's not just

large number."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "This is a tiny fraction, but a large number of them."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "And they're all operating at the threshold of error."}, {"time": 2239, "text":

have this specific receptor binding to get them into the cell."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "But everything else, yeah, the virus binds to something on the surface, very specific."}, {"time": 2405,

good."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "It's something they need."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And so the virus slips in."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?"}, {"time":

sufficiently intelligent alien civilization observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too because they understand fully exactly what we're doing."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "And then there's no

between active and passive."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing to a certain extent is fine because it helps people understand."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "But when you start to say, I think the virus is doing that because then you're putting a human lens on it, and you may be wrong."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "Because you don't know why things happen for a virus."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "So right now, we have variants emerging, and people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies are selecting for variants."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "That's a

with that."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "That's why I tell my students, be careful about the anthropomorphizing because you're gonna apply your values to a virus, and you have different values."},

operation, it doesn't make sense to treat them as humanlike because the scale of operations is much smaller."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "But with robots, you're in the same time scale, the same spatial scale."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "Of course, in the movies, they always give them names and personalities, right?"}, {"time": 2578, "text": "Yeah, well, yeah, that's the, but that's my argument is we should do the same when you're trying to solve the engineering problem of robotics too."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "It's not just for the movies."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Well, let me ask you this,

3482, "text": "There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating and how they work, people are trying to figure out."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "But there's not a lot of money to work on, you

these deadly viruses that are not very transmissible, Ebola, rabies."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And then there's these less deadly viruses that are very transmissible, like COVID, I guess kind of borderline."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "But why isn't there super transmissible, super deadly viruses?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "I think if you compare SARS one and two, you get somewhat of an answer,

infectious."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "So in a respiratory virus, you inhale the droplets with the virus and they reproduce in your upper respiratory tract, what we call the nasopharynx, right?"}, {"time": 3682, "text": "The nose and going back to that little cavity just above your mouth."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "So the virus reproduces really well."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And then as you talk and sneeze and cough, you expel droplets and then those are inhaled by other people and then they reproduce."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "And for SARS two, we now know there's a lot of reproduction just before you feel anything, if at all."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "So there's a lot of shedding and transmission before you get symptomatic."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "And as many people don't ever get symptomatic, right?"}, {"time": 3710, "text": "So they spread really easily."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So that explains why some viruses can transmit a lot better than others."}, {"time": 3717,

"text": "Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly by a highly lethal virus, you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "And most of the transmission occurs when people are being cared for at home or in hospitals."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "The doctors and nurses get the virus, but people walking around, you're not walking around when you have Ebola, you're too sick."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "You

think that's part of it, that if the infection is too lethal, you're simply not a good transmitter."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "And I think transmission is probably one of the most powerful selection forces for viruses because a virus always has to find a new host."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?"}, {"time": 3796, "text": "If it doesn't find a new host,

a nice systematic ways of doing this?"}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Do people kind of automate it?"}, {"time": 4776, "text": "And we, I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus, is it's 30,000 bases, a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "And what makes it more difficult is that you have to, it's been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "And so

to wear a suit and have to have special procedures and containment and so forth."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments on the virus."}, {"time": 4820, "text":

target."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So you have to figure that out ahead of time and decide what to go after."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And then you can look for drugs that inhibit what you're

kinds of RNA."}, {"time": 5022, "text": "They can have what we call plus RNA."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "They can have minus RNA, or they could have plus minus, actually two strands hybridized together."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "The plus RNA simply means that if you put that plus RNA in a cell, you know, your cell has ribosomes in it that make the proteins that you need."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA and begin to make proteins."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "So it has to be copied first."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And then the plus minus is both together."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "So the SARS coronaviruses, all the coronaviruses have plus RNA."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell, boom, it starts an infectious cycle."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "Same thing with poliovirus, by the way, which I worked on."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "Influenza viruses are negative stranded."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "So that's tough for the virus because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA from minus RNA."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "It doesn't have the enzyme to do it."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "So the virus has to carry it in inside the virus particle."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "And then when the minus RNA is in the cell, the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So it's a big difference."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "And then in the influenza viruses, not only is it minus RNA, but it's in pieces."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "It's in eight pieces."}, {"time": 5109, "text": "We call that segmented, whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "So they're like floating separately?"}, {"time": 5117, "text": "Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "They're all packaged inside that virus particle of influenza virus, but they're in pieces."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And why that's important is because if two different influenza viruses infect the same cell, the pieces as they reproduce can mix and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And that allows influenza virus to undergo extremely high frequency evolution."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "That's why we get pandemics."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "When we have a new flu pandemics is because somewhere in some animal, two viruses have reassorted and made a new virus that we hadn't seen before."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "So you're talking about kind of biological characteristics, but what am I incorrect in my intuition that are from the things I've heard that the influenza family viruses is more dangerous?"}, {"time": 5169, "text": "Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?"}, {"time": 5174, "text":

one."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "Some like the 1918 apparently was very lethal, killed a lot of people."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "But more contemporary viruses, we had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza."}, {"time": 5195, "text": "That wasn't such a lethal virus."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "We don't know exactly why, but it didn't kill that many people."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "It

too."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "So it depends on the virus."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "So there is another influenza virus that's currently circulating."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus that's still around."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "And then the 1968 pandemic virus, which was the one before 2009, that one is still around too."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "And that's more lethal."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "And depending on the season, some seasons the 2009 virus predominates, some seasons the 1968."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "And when the 68 is around, you

5339, "text": "So they get fertilized and there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and you put virus in it, it grows up and then you harvest it."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "You get about 10 mls of fluid."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "And then you take that, you treat it with formaldehyde or formalin and it inactivates the virus so it's no longer infectious."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "And you just inject that into people."}, {"time": 5358, "text": "And that was the first flu vaccine."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "It was made for the US Army actually."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "And then it got moved over to people."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "We still use that old school tech today."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "So you're taking, can you help me out here?"}, {"time": 5370, "text": "Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "Okay, so you're talking about, you're taking the actual virus, you put it in an egg, you let it grow up."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "It's very funny that you put it in an egg."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "It's very poetic."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "And then how do you make it not infection, not effective or whatever?"}, {"time": 5393, "text": "Not infectious."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Not infectious, is that the right term here?"}, {"time": 5397, "text": "So how do you make it not infectious?"}, {"time": 5398, "text": "You can treat it with any number of chemicals that'll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "So that step of disrupting the particle is that very specific to a particular variant

technology."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "So you called it old school in a way that's slightly dismissive, like people talk about Windows 98 or something."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "So is there risks involved with it?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?"}, {"time": 5437, "text": "No, it's only, it's, it's very easy."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "I mean, you could do it in cells and culture, but eggs were convenient."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells and culture."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "We didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "So we had to use something else."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "It's easy to do, but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical makes it not the best vaccine you can make."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "The flu vaccines that we have today, which are mostly based on this inactivation, is called inactivated virus vaccines."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "Oh, so like the kind of thing it presents to the immune system to train on is not close to the actual virus."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "Yes, that's what we think."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "So that's why probably the flu vaccines are just not very good, you know?"}, {"time": 5484, "text": "60% efficiency at the best, right?"},

we're testing a vaccine."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "We just measure sickness."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "That's really easy to score, right?"}, {"time": 5510, "text": "You do a trial and you say, if you feel sick, give us a call."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "We'll tell you what to do."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?"}, {"time": 5518, "text": "Sickness is the presence of symptoms?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?"}, {"time": 5524, "text": "A symptom is what you only can feel."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "Only you can feel an upset stomach or a sore throat or that sort of thing."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "It's the lived experience of a symptom."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure and tell that you're infected, like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?"}, {"time": 5546, "text": "Signs and symptoms."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you, well, if you have any of these symptoms, they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed to make sure you're picking them up, right?"}, {"time": 5556, "text": "So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "You call them and then they will do a PCR, make sure you've got flu and not some other virus that makes similar symptoms."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And then they would say, are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm and count up all the infections and see how the vaccine did, basically."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "That's so fascinating because the reporting, so symptom is what you feel."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "Yes, for sure."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "And certainly the mind has a ability to conjure up feelings."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "And so like culturally, maybe there was a time in our culture where it was looked down upon to feel sick or something like that, like toughen up kind of thing."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And so then you probably have very few symptoms being reported."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "And now is like much more, I don't know, perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "Now it's fascinating because then it changes."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "Oh, it is definitely a perception because for, your symptom may be nothing to me or vice versa, right?"}, {"time": 5626, "text": "And so when you're doing this, it's a little bit of a imprecise science because, and even it's a cultural thing in some countries, something that would make us feel horrible, they wouldn't even bother reporting."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "No, I didn't have any symptoms."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "So if you can measure things, it's always better, but you start out with a symptom."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "And if you say, if someone tells you this virus, 20% of the people are asymptomatic, they don't report symptoms, that number is probably not a constant."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "It depends where you did the study."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "It could be different in China versus South America, Europe, et cetera, yeah."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "I mean, I was trying to figure, so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine and I had zero symptoms."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "So, and I was wondering, well, see, but that's my feelings, right?"}, {"time": 5678, "text": "This is not, because I felt fine, I was waiting."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "Did you have pain at the injection site?"}, {"time": 5686, "text": "No, it was kind of pleasant."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You felt nothing the next day, no?"}, {"time": 5690, "text": "Nothing, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "I already put myself through crazy stuff."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "But I also got allergy shots and those, I was out all next day, like exhausted for some reason."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So that gave me like a sense like, okay, at least sometimes I can feel shitty."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "That's good to know."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "And then with the vaccine it didn't, but the question is like, how much does my mind come into play there?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "The expectations of symptoms, the expectations of not feeling well, how does that affect the sort of the self reporting of the symptoms?"}, {"time": 5742, "text": "I think it's definitely a variable there, but there's certainly many people that don't feel anything after the vaccines."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "And there's some that have a whole range of things like soreness and fever, et cetera, yeah."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "So okay, you were talking about the old school development inside the egg."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "What's better than that?"}, {"time": 5762, "text": "So then the next generation of vaccines which arose in the 50s were what we call replication competent, where the virus you take and it's actually reproducing in you."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "Yeah, that sounds safe."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "And it can be somewhat problematic, yes, as you might imagine, because once you put that virus in you, you have no more control, right?"}, {"time": 5784, "text": "It's not like you have a kill switch in it, which actually would be a great idea to put in."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?"}, {"time": 5792, "text": "No, you could just put something in there."}, {"time": 5794, "text": "If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And people are thinking about that because now we're engineering viruses to treat cancers and other diseases and we may wanna put kill switches in them just to make sure they don't run away."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "Oh, interesting, so you can deploy a drug that binds to this virus that would shut it off in the body, something like that."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "You'd have to engineer it in."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine that was made because that was a big problem."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "And this virus, and the way you do this, back in the old day was empirical."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine, he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "And he infected, I think he used chick embryos."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "And he went from one embryo to another and just kept passing and he did that hundreds of times."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And every 10 passages, he would take the virus and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And then eventually he got a virus that didn't cause any disease after 200 and some passages."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "And then that was tested in people and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "He selected for mutations that made the virus not cause disease, but still make an immune response."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "So those are called replication competent."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "We now have the polio vaccine, which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "Then we had measles, mumps, rubella."}, {"time": 5885, "text": "Those are all replication competent vaccines."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "And you mentioned is that's a good idea."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "They are all safe vaccines."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "The only one that has had an issue is the polio replication competent vaccine."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine because you take it orally, it's wonderful because you don't have to inject it."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "This is the perfect delivery."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "Either intranasal for a respiratory virus or orally for polio goes into your intestines."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "It reproduces and it gives you wonderful protection against polio."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "However, you do shed virus out and that virus is no longer a vaccine."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "It's reverted genetically in your intestine."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "So you can infect others with polio."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "Take that virus and put it into an animal and give it polio."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And in fact, the parents of some kids in the 60s and 70s who were immunized got polio from the vaccine."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "The rate was about one and one and a half million cases of polio."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "So it's called vaccine associated polio."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And I always argue that we may not have picked the right vaccine."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "There was a big fight in the US and other countries between the inactivated polio and the infectious polio vaccines, which ones we should be using because we found out that the infectious vaccine actually caused polio."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone got polio from the vaccine, which looking back is really not acceptable in my view, although the public health community said it was to get rid of polio."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "So now we're close to eradicating polio globally, but this vaccine derived polio is a problem."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine, which is tough because it's injected."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "So, okay, so the basic high level, how vaccines work principle is you want to deploy something in the body that's as close to the actual virus as possible, but doesn't do nearly as much harm."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "And there's like a million, not a million, but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "So those are two ways."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "And now of course we have modern ways we can make mRNA vaccines, right?"}, {"time": 6025, "text": "What are the modern ways?"}, {"time": 6026, "text": "I did, you wanna look, mRNA vaccine."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "So that's one of the, that's the most modern, but even before mRNA vaccines, we learned that we could use viruses to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "And so the Ebola vaccine, we took the spike gene of Ebola virus and put it in a different virus and we deliver that to people and that's called a vector vaccine."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors carrying the spike gene into the cell."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?"}, {"time": 6063, "text": "So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans but will not make you sick."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "In the case of adenovirus, the years and years of people studying it has told us what genes you could cut out and allow the virus to infect the cell but not cause any disease."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So instead of doing selection on it, you actually genetically modify it."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "Yes, you modify the vector, yeah."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So you're much more precise about it."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "You're very precise and then you splice in the gene for the spike and then you use that to deliver the gene and it becomes produced as protein and then you make an immune response."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "And vector is the term for this modified."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "Right, so we're now using viruses at our bidding."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "We can cure monogenic diseases."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "That is if you have, if you're born with a genetic disease, you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene, single gene, we can give you the regular gene back using a virus vector."}, {"time": 6123, "text": "So cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "I think in 10 to 15 years, most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "And not only can we put things in the vector to kill the tumor, we can target the vector to the tumor specifically in a number of ways."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "And that makes it less toxic, right?"}, {"time": 6148, "text": "It doesn't infect all your other cells."}, {"time": 6151, "text": "But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing because it requires a deep understanding."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors that have been studied for 20 years."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "Influenza virus is being used as a vector and even measles virus."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors and those are being used for COVID vaccines."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And then of course we have the newest, which is the nucleic acid vaccines."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So years ago, people said, why can't we just inject DNA into people?"}, {"time": 6198, "text": "Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it."}, {"time": 6202, "text": "So people tried many, many different vaccines."}, {"time": 6205, "text": "And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines that are DNA vaccines."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses that's a DNA based vaccine."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine, but no human."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine only work for DNA viruses?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "No, it can work for DNA or RNA."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "Because remember, for an RNA virus, we can make a DNA copy of it."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell, it goes into the nucleus."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "So it's, you're just skipping a step."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "You get proteins."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "For RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "So those didn't work for human vaccines."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "And there were many HIV AIDS vaccine trials that used DNA vaccines, didn't work."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "And then a number of years ago, people started thinking, how about RNA, RNA vaccines?"}, {"time": 6257, "text": "And I first heard this, I thought, what?"}, {"time": 6260, "text": "I've worked with RNA my whole career."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "It's so fragile."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "I mean, that's being facetious, right?"}, {"time": 6269, "text": "But you have to be very careful because your hands are full of enzymes that will degrade RNA."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "So I thought, how could this possibly work, injecting it into someone's?"}, {"time": 6280, "text": "It's an example of I was skeptical and I was wrong."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly and protect it in a lipid capsule, it actually works as a vaccine."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "And people were working on this years before COVID came around."}, {"time": 6297, "text": "They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines and there were a couple of companies that were working on it."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let's try it."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "And I was skeptical, frankly, because I just thought RNA would be too labile, but I was wrong."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "So this is, as we're saying offline, one of the great things about you is you're able to say when you're wrong about intuitions you've had in the past, which is a beautiful thing for a scientist."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "But I still think it's very surprising that something like that works, right?"}, {"time": 6330, "text": "Yeah, I am surprised."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And then now one thing is surprising that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "But then the other thing is why does it work that that's a good training ground for the immune system?"}, {"time": 6356, "text": "Is that obvious that that should work?"}, {"time": 6359, "text": "I don't think it's obvious to most people and it's worth going into it because it's really interesting."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats, in lipid membranes, right?"}, {"time": 6370, "text": "And the particular formulation they test for years to make sure it's stable, it lasts a long time after it's injected."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines, right, Moderna and Pfizer, they have different lipid formulations to get to the same."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "So that's a real part of it."}, {"time": 6389, "text": "And it's not simple."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "There are quite a few different lipids that they put into this coding."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "And they test to see how long they protect the RNA after it's injected, say, into a mouse, how long does it last?"}, {"time": 6400, "text": "And the way it works is these, apparently these lipid nanoparticles, they get injected into your muscle, they bump into cells and they get taken up."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So lipid fat is sticky."}, {"time": 6416, "text": "It's greasy, we like to say."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also."}, {"time": 6423, "text": "So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them, they stick and they eventually get taken up."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "And they figured this out right at the beginning."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle, will it get taken up into a cell?"}, {"time": 6435, "text": "And the answer was yes, it was just let's try it."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "And it worked."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "So it's basically experiment."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "It's not like some deep understanding of biology."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "It's experimentally speaking, it just seems to work."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "Yeah, well, they had some idea that lipids would target this to a cell membrane."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "And remember, there's no receptor involved."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "Like the virus has a specific protein that attaches to a receptor."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "It's not efficient enough to just bump around and get into a cell."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "That's what these things are doing."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And they probably optimize the lipids to get more efficient uptake."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "But it's not as efficient as a virus would be to get into a cell."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "Right, so you have no specific, I mean, which is why it's surprising that you can crack into the safe with a hammer."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "Or with some fat."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "I mean, that's kind of surprising."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "It's kind of amazing that it works."}, {"time": 6491, "text": "But so maybe let's try to talk about this."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "So one of the hesitancies around vaccines or basically around any new technology is the fact that mRNA is a new idea."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism, as you said, by the scientific community."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Because it's a cool new technology."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "Surprising that it works."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "I think one nice way to approach this is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "One side is why your intuition says that it's safe for humans."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "And what arguments can you see if you could steal man and argument why it's unsafe for humans."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "Or not unsafe for humans, but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "So many people are afraid because it's new technology and they feel it hasn't been tested."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "This is the nice thing about mRNA is that it doesn't last forever."}, {"time": 6572, "text": "As opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever, but it can last a lot longer."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And it could even go into your DNA, right?"}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So mRNA has a shorter lifetime, maybe days after it's injected into your arm, then it's gone."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "So that's a good thing because it's not gonna be around forever."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "So that would say, okay, so it's sticking around for your lifetime is not happening."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "But what else could happen?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "Well, let's see the protein that's made, could that be an issue?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And again, proteins don't last forever."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "They have a finite longevity in the body."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "Now this is a protein that's made after the RNA gets into the cell."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "And there's also a question, I'm sorry to interrupt, where in the body, so because it's not well targeted, or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted, but it can go throughout the body, that's one of the concerns."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "Right, so it's injected deep into your deltoid muscle, right here, shoulder."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel, otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So they go deep in a blood vessel and it's locally injected."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "And they did, before this even went into people, they did experiments in mice where they gave them a thousand times higher concentrations than they would ever give to people."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "And then when you do that, it can go everywhere basically."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "You can find these nanoparticles in every tissue of the mouse."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "But that's at a thousand fold higher concentration, right?"}, {"time": 6677, "text": "So I think at the levels that we're using in people, most of it's staying in the muscle, but sure, small amounts go elsewhere."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?"}, {"time": 6690, "text": "Like let's say ridiculously high quantities."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "I'm trying to understand what is the damage that could be done from an RNA just floating about."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "So the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem, it's the protein that is encoded in it, right?"}, {"time": 6703, "text": "This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us, so there's nothing that it could do."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "It's the protein that I would say you could ask, what is that gonna do?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And the one property we know about the spike is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?"}, {"time": 6726, "text": "That's how the virus gets in in the beginning."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "But so wait, I'm a bit confused."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA, there's no spike, right?"}, {"time": 6750, "text": "The mRNA codes for the spike."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "Creates a spike."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "And so that spike could cause fusion of cells."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "They made two amino acid changes in the spike so it would not fuse."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "So they understand enough which amino acids are responsible for the fusion."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So they could modify it."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "So now it's not gonna cause fusion, so that's not an issue."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "It's called the prefusion stabilized spike."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So the spike, when it binds ACE2, that top falls off and the part of the spike that causes fusion is now exposed."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So those are the things that could have happened, but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "But there's no better test than putting it into people, right?"}, {"time": 6802, "text": "And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three, and increasing numbers of people and asking, what do we see?"}, {"time": 6808, "text": "Do we have any concerns?"}, {"time": 6810, "text": "And so now it's been in many millions of people and we don't see most of the effects you see in a vaccine, you see in the first couple of months."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines, the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine, Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "And we've seen small numbers of those occur, but other things we haven't seen, and you never say never, right?"}, {"time": 6844, "text": "Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?"}, {"time": 6847, "text": "It's like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee and it has supposedly no calories, but it tastes really good."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on, I have not seen good medical evidence that is harmful to you, but it's like, it tastes too good."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "So I'm thinking like, there's gotta be longterm consequences, but it's very difficult to understand what the longterm consequences are."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "And there's this kind of like distant fear or anxiety about it."}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Like this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "There's gotta be, there's no free lunch in this world."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "This is the kind of feeling that people have about the longterm effects of the vaccine, that you mentioned that there's some intuition about near term effects that you want to remove, like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things, but they think, okay, this travels to other cells in the body, this travels to neurons or that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "And then what kind of effect does that have longterm that's yet to be discovered?"}, {"time": 6922, "text": "What do you make me for this vaccine, but in general in science about making statements about longterm negative effects?"}, {"time": 6932, "text": "Is that something that weighs heavy on you?"}, {"time": 6934, "text": "Is that something we can kind of escape through just large scale experimentation with animals and humans?"}, {"time": 6941, "text": "Well, if you're really, if you're concerned about longterm, then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "So if someone says to you, there are no longterm effects of the COVID vaccines, they can't say that because they haven't done the long experiment, right?"}, {"time": 6960, "text": "There's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "It's always, there's no free lunch, right?"}, {"time": 6966, "text": "There's always a risk benefit calculation you have to make."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "You can have the study, it goes 50 years and then decide, but I guess what you're doing is just like we said, I forget which one, with polio, with rabies, I forget, but you're weighing the side effects."}, {"time": 6985, "text": "Yeah, polio, right."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "The vaccine versus the effects of the virus."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And like both of them, you don't know longterm effects, but you're building up intuition as you study, which what are the longterm effects?"}, {"time": 7001, "text": "Like there's a huge number of people, like that have like, I don't want to say experts because I don't like the word, but people have studied it long enough to where they build up intuition."}, {"time": 7016, "text": "They don't know for sure."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "There's basic science being done, there's basic studies."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "But you start to build up an intuition of what might be a problem down the line and what is not, biologically speaking."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And so given that map, then considering the virus, there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID having negative effects on all aspects of the body, not just even respiratory, which is kind of interesting."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "So the cognitive stuff is terrifying."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "All kinds of systems evolve, yes."}, {"time": 7048, "text": "And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine and there seems to be less of that."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "But of course you don't know if it's some kind of dormant thing that's just going to."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "You won't know."}, {"time": 7060, "text": "You have to make a judgment."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "And for a lot of people they can't, right?"}, {"time": 7064, "text": "Because they don't have the tools to make the judgment."},

thing to do."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "And I have to say, I was involved in several lawsuits where parents of a kid who got paralyzed from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer and get some money for their kid."}, {"time": 7144, "text": "And so they got mad."}, {"time": 7147, "text": "And I think you could not..."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "The first issue could have been prevented,

what do we do today?"}, {"time": 7223, "text": "So I can look at, as we just said, I can look at what might happen and I can make reasonable decisions about the likelihood of them happening."},

question, what would they need to make a decision?"}, {"time": 7261, "text": "So if you're concerned about an effect in 40 years, we're not gonna know for 40 years."}, {"time": 7269, "text": "Yeah, so I think if I were to speak, because I talked to, like I mentioned offline to Joe Rogan and his podcast yesterday, I talked to him all the time about this."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "I think the concern is less about the long term effects like on paper."}, {"time": 7288, "text": "It's more about the, like people like Anthony Fauci and people at the top are simply misrepresenting the data or

public."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "So you can dive into it."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "And I know a lot of people ask me questions and I just say, it's right here in the data."}, {"time": 7434,

think that's highly unlikely."}, {"time": 7448, "text": "I think for the most part, the FDA requires the release of all the clinical trial data, right?"}, {"time": 7454, "text": "So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that's one thing."}, {"time": 7457, "text": "So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?"}, {"time": 7460, "text": "So there's a lot of different data sets here."},

here."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "So for these companies, and obviously there's a distrust of those folks too."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "They've done a lot of really good things in this world, but the incentives are such that you wanna sweep stuff under the rug if you're not 100% pure in your ethics."},

wrong thing we need."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "And so anybody who gets in, who causes a distrust in science to me, carries the responsibility of that and should be in, because the response, I mean,

think that's what's driving the larger narrative in the US to protect kids."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin, because increasing numbers of kids are being

more broad that is important to point out is that when you have COVID and you need an antiviral, it's usually because you can't breathe and you go in a hospital."}, {"time": 9532, "text": "Because if

little virus to begin with."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "You have an inflammatory problem that you need to treat in other ways."}, {"time": 9564, "text": "So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed,

vaccine."}, {"time": 9763, "text": "So I would say both natural infection and vaccination, sure, select for variants."}, {"time": 9771, "text": "Absolutely, there's no question, because they're inducing immunity."}, {"time": 9775, "text": "Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020, very few people in the world were immune as the virus first started spreading."}, {"time": 9785, "text": "But you can see in the sequences of those isolates from the beginning of 2020, you can see all of the changes that are now present in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies."}, {"time": 9797, "text": "They were already there, but there was no selection for them to emerge."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "Until November, when we now had many millions of people who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated, then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England, probably because of immune selection."}, {"time": 9815, "text": "Now, the virus that had the change that evaded the antibody had an advantage, and that virus drove through the population."}, {"time": 9824, "text": "So that's what we're seeing."}, {"time": 9825, "text": "All these variants are simply antigenic selection."}, {"time": 9827, "text": "So the variants, the mutations that are at the core of these, quote unquote, variants, they were always there all along the vaccine, or the infections

mean, it could make things much worse or much better, and we don't know."}, {"time": 9868, "text": "Well, with flu, we see year after year the virus changes, we change the vaccine, we deal with it, we change it again, there's an unending series."}, {"time": 9875, "text": "But see, that's a very different story."}, {"time": 9877, "text": "If, do you think COVID will be with some likelihood, like the flu, where it's basically variants, we'll never be able to eradicate it?"}, {"time": 9892, "text": "It will never eradicate it in any case, ever."}, {"time": 9897, "text": "Well, come up with a vaccine that makes you immune to enough variants where there's not enough evolutionary room."}, {"time": 9907, "text": "Well, if you cut down the number of infections, then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?"}, {"time": 9912, "text": "The problem is if, let's say you're a cynic and you say, well, vaccination is just selecting for variants, so let's stop it."}, {"time": 9920, "text": "But then you're gonna have infection, and that's gonna select for variants."}, {"time": 9923, "text": "And there, you're more likely to get very sick because we know the vaccines are really good at preventing you from dying."}, {"time": 9930, "text": "So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines because they prevent you from dying."}, {"time": 9936, "text": "That's the bottom line."}, {"time": 9938, "text": "But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?"}, {"time": 9945, "text": "And the reason I say that is because people who get naturally infected with SARS COVID, they develop

better than people who've gotten two doses of vaccine."}, {"time": 9970, "text": "For some reason, their immune response is suddenly broadened after the infection vaccination, and they can handle all the variants that we know of so far."}, {"time": 9979, "text": "So that tells me we can devise a strategy to do the same thing with a vaccine that makes a really broad vaccine that'll handle all the variants."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "Well, you actually, on the virology blog, I don't know if you're the author of that, but."}, {"time": 9992, "text": "I am, I am, yes."}, {"time": 9993, "text":

yeah."}, {"time": 10004, "text": "Yeah, it's an interesting idea that there's some early evidence now that mixing and matching vaccines, like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something, that creates a much better immunity than does two shots of Pfizer."}, {"time": 10022, "text": "I think that's worth exploring, absolutely."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "And this is relevant, what we're doing with influenza, you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year, why can't we devise a vaccine which you'd get once in your lifetime or maybe once every 10 years, okay?"}, {"time": 10037, "text": "So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein, kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2, it's stuck in the virus membrane, and the very tip, that's the part that changes every year."},

prevent infection."}, {"time": 10061, "text": "It's just that when people are infected or with the current vaccines, they don't make many antibodies to that stem part, but we're trying to figure out how to make those and we think they would be broadly protective and you'd never be able to, or more rarely be able to have a variant emerge that escaped it."}, {"time": 10080, "text": "And I think we can do the same thing with coronavirus too, for sure."}, {"time": 10086, "text": "Can I ask you about testing?"}, {"time": 10090, "text": "You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?"}, {"time":

the way involves reverse transcriptase because it converts the viral RNA to DNA and then you amplify it."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "And you can specify what part of the viral RNA you wanna amplify

viral RNA loads, right?"}, {"time": 10172, "text": "And a common mistake that many people who should know better, physicians and scientists of all kinds, they think that indicates how much virus you have."}, {"time": 10185, "text": "It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you and it probably means you're infected."}, {"time": 10191, "text": "But you can't use it to shed light on what's going on and I'll tell you why in a bit."}, {"time": 10196, "text": "But first we have to explain some other things."}, {"time": 10201, "text": "So until you get to about a million copies of RNA, so you can measure the copy number in this test, this PCR test."}, {"time": 10210, "text": "It's a number called CT or cycle threshold."}, {"time": 10213, "text": "The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles and every cycle it amplifies what you put in and the more cycles you need to see something, that means there's not a lot of RNA there."}, {"time": 10226, "text": "So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35, you have very little RNA in you."}, {"time": 10233, "text": "Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10, you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles to detect it."}, {"time": 10240, "text": "And you can extrapolate from that number, the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab."}, {"time": 10246, "text": "And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious."}, {"time": 10249, "text": "You're not gonna infect anyone."}, {"time": 10250, "text": "So in the early days, no matter what CT, what PCR result you had, they would quarantine you."}, {"time": 10256, "text": "And that was wrong because you're not shedding."}, {"time": 10258, "text": "You don't need to be quarantined, but wasn't thought through properly, right?"},

normal infection."}, {"time": 10271, "text": "Now it's 10 days should be fine."}, {"time": 10274, "text": "So what happens is you get infected, you don't know it of course."}, {"time": 10277, "text":

asymptomatic."}, {"time": 10288, "text": "You're shedding, you can infect others."}, {"time": 10290, "text": "And then you may or may not have your symptom onset."}, {"time": 10293, "text": "So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "And then within three days, four days, the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding, you're no longer

vaccines and so on."}, {"time": 10443, "text": "Vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time."}, {"time": 10448, "text": "And you have to be aware no matter what that there's hesitancy with the vaccines in this country before."}, {"time": 10453, "text": "I mean, yeah, that's a reality."}, {"time": 10455, "text": "You can't just be like magically saying that you're going to overcome that."}, {"time": 10460, "text": "And I don't think there's any hesitancy and cheap tests at home."}, {"time": 10464, "text": "I think if someone, so the question is if someone tested positive, would

"text": "But it's probably at least several thousand particles, if not more."}, {"time": 10646, "text": "And it could be that for most people, the tiny droplets don't have enough virus to infect someone else."}, {"time": 10654, "text": "But there's one observation about this virus that's really interesting."}, {"time": 10658, "text": "And that is that 80% of transmissions are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people."}, {"time": 10666, "text": "Not every infected person transmits."}, {"time": 10669, "text": "That's been borne out in multiple studies."}, {"time": 10671, "text": "And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado where they quantified the viral RNA loads in all the swabs that had been done of students for like a six month period."}, {"time": 10683,

transmit."}, {"time": 10698, "text": "So those are the ones that might get enough virus in the tiny droplets to be able to infect someone at a distance."}, {"time": 10706, "text": "And I think that's entirely possible."}, {"time": 10708, "text": "Why is it hard to study?"}, {"time": 10711, "text": "You can't do it in real life because you don't know who's infected."}, {"time": 10715, "text": "And

animal, you just don't know what the relevance of that is to people."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments."}, {"time": 10730, "text": "And we don't do that at this point, at least not for this virus."}, {"time": 10733, "text": "So that's why it's hard to know what's going on."}, {"time": 10735, "text": "So we have to make inferences from epidemiological associations where you're studying, say transmission in a household where people are stuck in the same rooms together and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets were involved."}, {"time": 10750, "text": "So that makes it much harder too."}, {"time": 10751, "text": "If you're leaning on epidemiological stuff as opposed to like biophysics or something like the mechanic."}, {"time": 10758, "text": "So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions like masks, to ask the question, how well do masks work?"}, {"time": 10766, "text": "Because then to answer that question, you can lean on epidemiological stuff again, like looking at populations that wear masks versus don't wear masks."}, {"time": 10776, "text": "As opposed to actually saying, like from an engineering perspective, like what kind of material and what kind of tightness by which amount decreases the viral load that's received on the other end."}, {"time": 10792, "text": "But some experiments have been done with masks and just droplets with no virus in them, right?"}, {"time": 10798, "text": "And you can measure the efficiency of different mask materials at keeping those in."}, {"time": 10804, "text": "So if I say that this mask stops 70% of this or larger size droplet, that leads to this percent decreased transmission."}, {"time": 10818, "text": "And also on both the generation and the receiving end and the giving end."}, {"time": 10828, "text": "So how well do masks protect you from others?"}, {"time": 10830, "text": "How well do you do mask protect others from you?"}, {"time": 10834, "text": "Like all of those things seem like they could be more rigorously studied."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "And now is the time because once this is over, nobody's gonna do it."}, {"time": 10847, "text": "Nobody's gonna care."}, {"time": 10849, "text": "But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing, but masks, like the good mask, whatever the good means, whatever that means, like some level of quality of material on your face, if it's shown to actually like thoroughly shown to work well, that seems like an obvious solution to reopen society with."}, {"time": 10874, "text": "If you have a good understanding of how well they work."}, {"time": 10877, "text": "Because if you don't have a good understanding, if there's a lot of uncertainty, that's when you get, and you have people speaking from authority, that's when you start getting the politicization of the solution."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "No, the data, there are some data, most, they're mostly epidemiological and they show some effect in some countries, right?"}, {"time": 10899, "text": "But they could be way better."}, {"time": 10901, "text": "And, but the fact that they're not perfect, then people take advantage of and say, well, look, they don't work that well, so I'm not gonna wear it."}, {"time": 10909, "text": "I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse."}, {"time": 10913, "text": "But even if it works, so Daniel always says, a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%, and then distance will do another 30%."}, {"time": 10923, "text": "Yeah, those numbers are made up though."}, {"time": 10925, "text": "I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates."}, {"time": 10929, "text": "And many of them are made based on models, right?"}, {"time": 10933, "text": "We make this model, and let's say the mask cuts down this much, what will be the effect on it?"}, {"time": 10937, "text": "I mean, yeah, they're models, and it's for the same reason."}, {"time": 10940, "text": "I don't believe the transmission of the variants because it's all based on statistical models as well, not biological experiments done in a lab."}, {"time": 10949, "text": "So in that sense, vaccine data is much better than mask data."}, {"time": 10953, "text": "For sure, for sure."}, {"time": 10954, "text": "So my problem with the mask data, which I always thought was fascinating, I stopped talking about it."}, {"time": 10959, "text": "I was in a paper about masks."}, {"time": 10961, "text": "I stopped talking about it because what started happening is masks created assholes on both sides."}, {"time": 10968, "text": "The people that were like in Silicon Valley, the friends of mine that were wearing masks, the way they look at others who don't is like... Well, that's a whole nother issue, right?"}, {"time": 10979, "text": "That happens when you don't have solid science."}, {"time": 10982, "text": "Understood."}, {"time": 10983, "text": "They now start judging you like you're a lesser human being."}, {"time": 10987, "text": "You're not only dumb, but you're almost like evil."}, {"time": 10991, "text": "You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask."}, {"time": 10994, "text": "And then the people looking in the other way are seeing you for the asshole that you're being for judging them unrightly."}, {"time": 11002, "text": "So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask."}, {"time": 11004, "text": "And there's this division that's created that was heartbreaking to me because masks like testing is a solution that was available early on."}, {"time": 11013, "text": "And if understood well, it could be deployed in a mass scale, and it seems like there's some historical evidence for other viruses where it does very well."}, {"time": 11022, "text": "And so like the fact that this was politicized, yeah, it was a little bit heartbreaking."}, {"time": 11028, "text": "You can find in the literature studies, mostly of healthcare workers and influenza, where you can actually, because you see the people every day that can sample them, you can actually see what masking does."}, {"time": 11040, "text": "And some of them show an effect and others do not, then that's the problem."}, {"time": 11045, "text": "Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough and then people latch onto that, see, it doesn't really work."}, {"time": 11051, "text": "But I think the main issue is that in January, both CDC and WHO said masks don't work, don't use them."}, {"time": 11060, "text": "That was the kiss of death for masks because when they then changed their mind, they didn't say we screwed up."}, {"time": 11068, "text": "They just said wear masks."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong, I think more people would have worn masks."}, {"time": 11076, "text": "And like you said, admitting you're wrong is like a real big part of it."}, {"time": 11081, "text": "And I also think almost the better way is not just saying you're wrong, but in January saying, like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate."}, {"time": 11092, "text": "Like actually, like reveal what was done with the Spanish flu at the beginning of the previous century, because there's a lot of mass controversy then too."}, {"time": 11103, "text": "It went back and forth."}, {"time": 11104,

"And just reveal this, we don't know, but like with some probability, this is the best option we got currently."}, {"time": 11120, "text": "And then in a month or two, adjust it, saying that, you know what, our like uncertainty decreased a little bit."}, {"time": 11127, "text": "We have a better idea."}, {"time": 11129, "text": "Like that was an incorrect estimate, but reveal that you're struggling."}, {"time": 11134, "text": "It's not like this weird binary clock that goes one direction or the other."}, {"time": 11138, "text": "You're struggling with uncertainty."}, {"time": 11141,

if you give them, if you have transparent and give them information in a real authentic way, like don't look like you're hiding something."}, {"time": 11159, "text": "I think they're intelligent enough to use that data to make decisions."}, {"time": 11163, "text": "It's the same thing as with the testing, is if you put that power in the people's hands to know if they're sick or not, they're gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think."}, {"time": 11174, "text": "The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking."}, {"time": 11178, "text": "I think that's a good point though, that most people don't seem to have an objection to testing."}, {"time": 11184, "text": "And then obviously Macamina makes that point brilliantly."}, {"time": 11187, "text": "And still there's very little excitement around that."}, {"time": 11193, "text": "But he said he was going to do it."}, {"time": 11195, "text": "I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then."}, {"time": 11197, "text": "So I

kinds of things very difficult."}, {"time": 11217, "text": "And then there's not much money to be made on it without that."}, {"time": 11221, "text": "I think there's just economic pressures against it."}, {"time": 11224, "text": "And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there where the companies, lobbyists and all those, there's this

the encroaching, their own mortality, their own death on the horizon."}, {"time": 11607, "text": "I think one of the messages in the book that ultimately like love for others."}, {"time": 11614,

the distance, with the masks, that's all fine."}, {"time": 11630, "text": "But there's a distancing from people of that tension, the breaking of the common humanity between people."}, {"time": 11639,

to the story of the doctor who basically gives in and just gives himself as a service to others."}, {"time": 11670, "text": "And that love is the thing that liberates him from his own conception of

effect is not just sickness, it's what it does to people."}, {"time": 11739, "text": "Because in the end, we are animals, and most animals like each other, and they interact, they have great social

most of the motivation for everything that was done is to help other people."}, {"time": 11832, "text": "I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers, maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs really wanted to get this out quickly and help people, right?"}, {"time": 11842, "text": "I think at every level, people who are contributing really wanted to help other people and

think for me, someone who studied viruses for over 40 years, it's just amazing that an invisible thing can do that, right?"}, {"time": 11891, "text": "It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,
