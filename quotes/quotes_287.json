419, "text": "There's useful elements to it in that it helps us understand our own ethical codes, humans."}, {"time": 427, "text": "So even just as a thought experiment, if you imagine that an AGI system is here today, how would we program it is a kind of nice thought experiment of constructing how should we have a law, have a system of laws for us humans."}, {"time": 444, "text": "It's just a nice practical tool."}, {"time": 446, "text": "And I think there's echoes of that idea too in the AI systems we have today that don't have to be that intelligent."}, {"time": 454, "text": "Like autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 455, "text": "These things start creeping in that are worth thinking about, but certainly they shouldn't be framed as how."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Looking back, what is the most, I'm sorry if it's a silly question, but what is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning or AI in general that you've ever come across?"}, {"time": 476, "text": "Sort of personally, when you said back and just had this kind of, oh, that's pretty cool moment."}, {"time": 484, "text": "That's surprising."}, {"time": 485, "text": "I don't know if it's an idea rather than a sort of empirical fact."}, {"time": 492, "text": "The fact that you can build gigantic neural nets, train them on relatively small amounts of data relatively with stochastic gradient descent and that it actually works, breaks everything you read in every textbook, right?"}, {"time": 509, "text": "Every pre deep learning textbook that told you, you need to have fewer parameters and you have data samples."}, {"time": 517, "text": "If you have a non convex objective function, you have no guarantee of convergence."}, {"time": 520, "text": "All those things that you read in textbook and they tell you to stay away from this and they're all wrong."}, {"time": 525, "text": "The huge number of parameters, non convex, and somehow which is very relative to the number of parameters data, it's able to learn anything."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Does that still surprise you today?"}, {"time": 537, "text": "Well, it was kind of obvious to me before I knew anything that this is a good idea."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And then it became surprising that it worked because I started reading those textbooks."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So can you talk through the intuition of why it was obvious to you if you remember?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "So the intuition was it's sort of like, those people in the late 19th century who proved that heavier than air flight was impossible."}, {"time": 565, "text": "And of course you have birds, right?"}, {"time": 566, "text": "They do fly."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And so on the face of it, it's obviously wrong as an empirical question, right?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "And so we have the same kind of thing that we know that the brain works."}, {"time": 578, "text": "We don't know how, but we know it works."}, {"time": 579, "text": "And we know it's a large network of neurons and interaction and that learning takes place by changing the connection."}, {"time": 585, "text": "So kind of getting this level of inspiration without copying the details, but sort of trying to derive basic principles, and that kind of gives you a clue as to which direction to go."}, {"time": 598, "text": "There's also the idea somehow that I've been convinced of since I was an undergrad that, even before, that intelligence is inseparable from learning."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So the idea somehow that you can create an intelligent machine by basically programming, for me it was a non starter from the start."}, {"time": 617, "text": "Every intelligent entity that we know about arrives at this intelligence through learning."}, {"time": 624, "text": "So machine learning was a completely obvious path."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Also because I'm lazy, so, you know, kind of."}, {"time": 632, "text": "He's automate basically everything and learning is the automation of intelligence."}, {"time": 637, "text": "So do you think, so what is learning then?"}, {"time": 642, "text": "What falls under learning?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "Because do you think of reasoning as learning?"}, {"time": 648, "text": "Well, reasoning is certainly a consequence of learning as well, just like other functions of the brain."}, {"time": 656, "text": "The big question about reasoning is, how do you make reasoning compatible with gradient based learning?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "Do you think neural networks can be made to reason?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "Yes, there is no question about that."}, {"time": 667, "text": "Again, we have a good example, right?"}, {"time": 670, "text": "The question is how?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "So the question is how much prior structure do you have to put in the neural net so that something like human reasoning will emerge from it, you know, from learning?"}, {"time": 680, "text": "Another question is all of our kind of model of what reasoning is that are based on logic are discrete and are therefore incompatible with gradient based learning."}, {"time": 692, "text": "And I'm a very strong believer in this idea of gradient based learning."}, {"time": 695, "text": "I don't believe that other types of learning that don't use kind of gradient information if you want."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So you don't like discrete mathematics?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "You don't like anything discrete?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "Well, that's, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that it's incompatible with learning and I'm a big fan of learning, right?"}, {"time": 711, "text": "So in fact, that's perhaps one reason why deep learning has been kind of looked at with suspicion by a lot of computer scientists because the math is very different."}, {"time": 719, "text": "The math that you use for deep learning, you know, it kind of has more to do with, you know, cybernetics, the kind of math you do in electrical engineering than the kind of math you do in computer science."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And, you know, nothing in machine learning is exact, right?"}, {"time": 735, "text": "Computer science is all about sort of, you know, obviously compulsive attention to details of like, you know, every index has to be right."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And you can prove that an algorithm is correct, right?"}, {"time": 746, "text": "Machine learning is the science of sloppiness, really."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So, okay, maybe let's feel around in the dark of what is a neural network that reasons or a system that works with continuous functions that's able to do, build knowledge, however we think about reasoning, build on previous knowledge, build on extra knowledge, create new knowledge, generalize outside of any training set to ever build."}, {"time": 783, "text": "What does that look like?"}, {"time": 784, "text": "If, yeah, maybe give inklings of thoughts of what that might look like."}, {"time": 790, "text": "Yeah, I mean, yes and no."}, {"time": 792, "text": "If I had precise ideas about this, I think, you know, we'd be building it right now."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And there are people working on this whose main research interest is actually exactly that, right?"}, {"time": 802, "text": "So what you need to have is a working memory."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So you need to have some device, if you want, some subsystem that can store a relatively large number of factual episodic information for, you know, a reasonable amount of time."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So, you know, in the brain, for example, there are kind of three main types of memory."}, {"time": 825, "text": "One is the sort of memory of the state of your cortex."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And that sort of disappears within 20 seconds."}, {"time": 835, "text": "You can't remember things for more than about 20 seconds or a minute if you don't have any other form of memory."}, {"time": 842, "text": "The second type of memory, which is longer term, is still short term, is the hippocampus."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So you can, you know, you came into this building, you remember where the exit is, where the elevators are."}, {"time": 854, "text": "You have some map of that building that's stored in your hippocampus."}, {"time": 857, "text": "You might remember something about what I said, you know, a few minutes ago."}, {"time": 861, "text": "I forgot it all already."}, {"time": 862, "text": "Of course, it's been erased, but, you know, but that would be in your hippocampus."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And then the longer term memory is in the synapse, the synapses, right?"}, {"time": 872, "text": "So what you need if you want a system that's capable of reasoning is that you want the hippocampus like thing, right?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "And that's what people have tried to do with memory networks and, you know, neural training machines and stuff like that, right?"}, {"time": 885, "text": "And now with transformers, which have sort of a memory in there, kind of self attention system."}, {"time": 895, "text": "So that's one element you need."}, {"time": 897, "text": "Another thing you need is some sort of network that can access this memory, get an information back and then kind of crunch on it and then do this iteratively multiple times because a chain of reasoning is a process by which you update your knowledge about the state of the world, about, you know, what's going to happen, et cetera."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And that has to be this sort of recurrent operation basically."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And you think that kind of, if we think about a transformer, so that seems to be too small to contain the knowledge that's, to represent the knowledge that's contained in Wikipedia, for example."}, {"time": 939, "text": "Well, a transformer doesn't have this idea of recurrence."}, {"time": 942, "text": "It's got a fixed number of layers and that's the number of steps that, you know, limits basically its representation."}, {"time": 947, "text": "But recurrence would build on the knowledge somehow."}, {"time": 951, "text": "I mean, it would evolve the knowledge and expand the amount of information perhaps or useful information within that knowledge."}, {"time": 960, "text": "But is this something that just can emerge with size?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "Because it seems like everything we have now is too small."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Not just, no, it's not clear."}, {"time": 969, "text": "I mean, how you access and write into an associative memory in an efficient way."}, {"time": 973, "text": "I mean, sort of the original memory network maybe had something like the right architecture, but if you try to scale up a memory network so that the memory contains all the Wikipedia, it doesn't quite work."}, {"time": 985, "text": "So there's a need for new ideas there, okay."}, {"time": 988, "text": "But it's not the only form of reasoning."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So there's another form of reasoning, which is true, which is very classical also in some types of AI."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And it's based on, let's call it energy minimization."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Okay, so you have some sort of objective, some energy function that represents the quality or the negative quality, okay."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Energy goes up when things get bad and they get low when things get good."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So let's say you want to figure out, what gestures do I need to do to grab an object or walk out the door."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "If you have a good model of your own body, a good model of the environment, using this kind of energy minimization, you can do planning."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And in optimal control, it's called model predictive control."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "You have a model of what's gonna happen in the world as a consequence of your actions."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "And that allows you to, by energy minimization, figure out the sequence of action that optimizes a particular objective function, which measures, minimizes the number of times you're gonna hit something and the energy you're gonna spend doing the gesture and et cetera."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So that's a form of reasoning."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Planning is a form of reasoning."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And perhaps what led to the ability of humans to reason is the fact that, or species that appear before us had to do some sort of planning to be able to hunt and survive and survive the winter in particular."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And so it's the same capacity that you need to have."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "So in your intuition is, if we look at expert systems and encoding knowledge as logic systems, as graphs, in this kind of way, is not a useful way to think about knowledge?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Graphs are a little brittle or logic representation."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "So basically, variables that have values and then constraint between them that are represented by rules, is a little too rigid and too brittle, right?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So some of the early efforts in that respect were to put probabilities on them."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So a rule, if you have this and that symptom, you have this disease with that probability and you should prescribe that antibiotic with that probability, right?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "That's the mycin system from the 70s."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And that's what that branch of AI led to, based on networks and graphical models and causal inference and variational method."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So there is certainly a lot of interesting work going on in this area."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "The main issue with this is knowledge acquisition."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "How do you reduce a bunch of data to a graph of this type?"}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Yeah, it relies on the expert, on the human being, to encode, to add knowledge."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And that's essentially impractical."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Yeah, it's not scalable."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "That's a big question."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "The second question is, do you want to represent knowledge as symbols and do you want to manipulate them with logic?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And again, that's incompatible with learning."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "So one suggestion, which Jeff Hinton has been advocating for many decades, is replace symbols by vectors."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Think of it as pattern of activities in a bunch of neurons or units or whatever you want to call them."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And replace logic by continuous functions."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "Okay, and that becomes now compatible."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "There's a very good set of ideas by, written in a paper about 10 years ago by Leon Boutout, who is here at Facebook."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "The title of the paper is, From Machine Learning to Machine Reasoning."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "And his idea is that a learning system should be able to manipulate objects that are in a space and then put the result back in the same space."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "So it's this idea of working memory, basically."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And it's very enlightening."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "And in a sense, that might learn something like the simple expert systems."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "I mean, you can learn basic logic operations there."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Yeah, quite possibly."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "There's a big debate on sort of how much prior structure you have to put in for this kind of stuff to emerge."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "That's the debate I have with Gary Marcus and people like that."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so, and the other person, so I just talked to Judea Pearl, from the you mentioned causal inference world."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So his worry is that the current neural networks are not able to learn what causes what causal inference between things."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So I think he's right and wrong about this."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "If he's talking about the sort of classic type of neural nets, people sort of didn't worry too much about this."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "But there's a lot of people now working on causal inference."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And there's a paper that just came out last week by Leon Boutou, among others, David Lopez, Baz, and a bunch of other people, exactly on that problem of how do you kind of get a neural net to sort of pay attention to real causal relationships, which may also solve issues of bias in data and things like this, so."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "I'd like to read that paper because that ultimately the challenges also seems to fall back on the human expert to ultimately decide causality between things."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "People are not very good at establishing causality, first of all."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "So first of all, you talk to physicists and physicists actually don't believe in causality because look at all the basic laws of microphysics are time reversible, so there's no causality."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "The arrow of time is not real, yeah."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's as soon as you start looking at macroscopic systems where there is unpredictable randomness, where there is clearly an arrow of time, but it's a big mystery in physics, actually, how that emerges."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Is it emergent or is it part of the fundamental fabric of reality?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Or is it a bias of intelligent systems that because of the second law of thermodynamics, we perceive a particular arrow of time, but in fact, it's kind of arbitrary, right?"}, {"time": 1365, "text": "So yeah, physicists, mathematicians, they don't care about, I mean, the math doesn't care about the flow of time."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Well, certainly, macrophysics doesn't."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "People themselves are not very good at establishing causal relationships."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "If you ask, I think it was in one of Seymour Papert's book on children learning."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "He studied with Jean Piaget."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "He's the guy who coauthored the book Perceptron with Marvin Minsky that kind of killed the first wave of neural nets, but he was actually a learning person."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "He, in the sense of studying learning in humans and machines, that's why he got interested in Perceptron."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And he wrote that if you ask a little kid about what is the cause of the wind, a lot of kids will say, they will think for a while and they'll say, oh, it's the branches in the trees, they move and that creates wind, right?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "So they get the causal relationship backwards."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And it's because their understanding of the world and intuitive physics is not that great, right?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "I mean, these are like, you know, four or five year old kids."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "You know, it gets better, and then you understand that this, it can be, right?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "But there are many things which we can, because of our common sense understanding of things, what people call common sense, and our understanding of physics, we can, there's a lot of stuff that we can figure out causality."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "Even with diseases, we can figure out what's not causing what, often."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "There's a lot of mystery, of course, but the idea is that you should be able to encode that into systems, because it seems unlikely they'd be able to figure that out themselves."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Well, whenever we can do intervention, but you know, all of humanity has been completely deluded for millennia, probably since its existence, about a very, very wrong causal relationship, where whatever you can explain, you attribute it to, you know, some deity, some divinity, right?"}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And that's a cop out, that's a way of saying like, I don't know the cause, so you know, God did it, right?"}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So you mentioned Marvin Minsky, and the irony of, you know, maybe causing the first AI winter."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "You were there in the 90s, you were there in the 80s, of course."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "In the 90s, why do you think people lost faith in deep learning, in the 90s, and found it again, a decade later, over a decade later?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Yeah, it wasn't called deep learning yet, it was just called neural nets, but yeah, they lost interest."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "I mean, I think I would put that around 1995, at least the machine learning community, there was always a neural net community, but it became kind of disconnected from sort of mainstream machine learning, if you want."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "There were, it was basically electrical engineering that kept at it, and computer science gave up on neural nets."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "I don't know, you know, I was too close to it to really sort of analyze it with sort of an unbiased eye, if you want, but I would make a few guesses."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "So the first one is, at the time, neural nets were, it was very hard to make them work, in the sense that you would implement backprop in your favorite language, and that favorite language was not Python, it was not MATLAB, it was not any of those things, because they didn't exist, right?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "You had to write it in Fortran OC, or something like this, right?"}, {"time": 1576, "text": "So you would experiment with it, you would probably make some very basic mistakes, like, you know, badly initialize your weights, make the network too small, because you read in the textbook, you know, you don't want too many parameters, right?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "And of course, you know, and you would train on XOR, because you didn't have any other data set to trade on."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "And of course, you know, it works half the time."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "So you would say, I give up."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "Also, you would train it with batch gradient, which, you know, isn't that sufficient."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So there's a lot of, there's a bag of tricks that you had to know to make those things work, or you had to reinvent, and a lot of people just didn't, and they just couldn't make it work."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "The investment in software platform to be able to kind of, you know, display things, figure out why things don't work, kind of get a good intuition for how to get them to work, have enough flexibility so you can create, you know, network architectures like convolutional nets and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "It was hard."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I mean, you had to write everything from scratch."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And again, you didn't have any Python or MATLAB or anything, right?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "I read that, sorry to interrupt, but I read that you wrote in Lisp the first versions of Lanet with convolutional networks, which by the way, one of my favorite languages."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "That's how I knew you were legit."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Turing award, whatever."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "You programmed in Lisp, that's..."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "It's still my favorite language, but it's not that we programmed in Lisp, it's that we had to write our Lisp interpreter, okay?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Because it's not like we used one that existed."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So we wrote a Lisp interpreter that we hooked up to, you know, a backend library that we wrote also for sort of neural net computation."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "And then after a few years around 1991, we invented this idea of basically having modules that know how to forward propagate and back propagate gradients, and then interconnecting those modules in a graph."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "Number two had made proposals on this, about this in the late eighties, and we were able to implement this using our Lisp system."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Eventually we wanted to use that system to build production code for character recognition at Bell Labs."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So we actually wrote a compiler for that Lisp interpreter so that Patricia Simard, who is now at Microsoft, kind of did the bulk of it with Leon and me."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "And so we could write our system in Lisp and then compile to C, and then we'll have a self contained complete system that could kind of do the entire thing."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Neither PyTorch nor TensorFlow can do this today."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Yeah, okay, it's coming."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "I mean, there's something like that in PyTorch called TorchScript."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And so, you know, we had to write our Lisp interpreter, we had to write our Lisp compiler, we had to invest a huge amount of effort to do this."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And not everybody, if you don't completely believe in the concept, you're not going to invest the time to do this."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Now at the time also, you know, or today, this would turn into Torch or PyTorch or TensorFlow or whatever, we'd put it in open source, everybody would use it and, you know, realize it's good."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Back before 1995, working at AT&T, there's no way the lawyers would let you release anything in open source of this nature."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "And so we could not distribute our code really."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And on that point, and sorry to go on a million tangents, but on that point, I also read that there was some, almost like a patent on convolutional neural networks at Bell Labs."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "So that, first of all, I mean, just."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "There's two actually."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "That ran out."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "Thankfully, in 2007."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "In 2007."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So I'm gonna, what, can we just talk about that for a second?"}, {"time": 1788, "text": "I know you're a Facebook, but you're also at NYU."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And what does it mean to patent ideas like these software ideas, essentially?"}, {"time": 1798, "text": "Or what are mathematical ideas?"}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Or what are they?"}, {"time": 1803, "text": "Okay, so they're not mathematical ideas."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "They are, you know, algorithms."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And there was a period where the US Patent Office

one reason you need those interactive environments actually."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "But this is like a huge technical problem that is not solved, and that explains why self supervised learning works in the context of natural language, but does not work in the context, or at least not well, in the context of image recognition and video, although it's making progress quickly."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And the reason, that reason is the fact that it's much easier to represent uncertainty in the prediction in a context of natural language than it is in the context of things like video and images."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So for example, if I ask you to predict what words are missing, 15% of the words that I've taken out."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "The possibilities are small."},

probability vector, right?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "It's a bunch of numbers between zero and one that sum to one."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "And we know how to do this with computers."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So there, representing uncertainty in the prediction is relatively easy, and that's, in my opinion, why those techniques work for NLP."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "For images, if you ask..."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "If you block a piece of an image, and you ask the system, reconstruct that piece of the image, there are many possible answers."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "They are all perfectly legit, right?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And how do you represent this set of possible answers?"}, {"time": 2938, "text": "You can't train a system to make one prediction."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "You can't train a neural net to say, here it is, that's the image, because there's a whole set of things that are compatible with it."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "So how do you get the machine to represent not a single output, but a whole set of outputs?"}, {"time": 2953, "text": "And similarly with video prediction, there's a lot of things that can happen in the future of video."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "You're looking at me right now."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I'm not moving my head very much, but I might turn my head to the left or to the right."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "If you don't have a system that can predict this, and you train it with least square to minimize the error with the prediction and what I'm doing, what you get is a blurry image of myself in all possible future positions that I might be in, which is not a good prediction."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "So there might be other ways to do the self supervision for visual scenes."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "I mean, if I knew, I wouldn't tell you, publish it first, I don't know."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "No, there might be."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So I mean, these are kind of, there might be artificial ways of like self play in games, the way you can simulate part of the environment."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Oh, that doesn't solve the problem."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "It's just a way of generating data."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "But because you have more of a control, like maybe you can control, yeah, it's a way to generate data."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And because you can do huge amounts of data generation, that doesn't, you're right."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Well, it creeps up on the problem from the side of data, and you don't think that's the right way to creep up."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "It doesn't solve this problem of handling uncertainty in the world, right?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "So if you have a machine learn a predictive model of the world in a game that is deterministic or quasi deterministic, it's easy, right?"}, {"time": 3042, "text": "Just give a few frames of the game to a ConvNet, put a bunch of layers, and then have the game generates the next few frames."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "And if the game is deterministic, it works fine."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "And that includes feeding the system with the action that your little character is gonna take."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "The problem comes from the fact that the real world and most games are not entirely predictable."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And so there you get those blurry predictions and you can't do planning with blurry predictions, right?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So if you have a perfect model of the world, you can, in your head, run this model with a hypothesis for a sequence of actions, and you're going to predict the outcome of that sequence of actions."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "But if your model is imperfect, how can you plan?"}, {"time":

about in terms of robotics, is active learning."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "So as opposed to sort of completely unsupervised or self supervised learning, you ask the system for human help for selecting parts you want annotated next."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So if you think about a robot exploring a space or a baby exploring a space or a system exploring a data set, every once in a while asking for

different ways."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "You can be stupid because your model of the world is wrong."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "You can be stupid because your objective is not aligned with what you actually want to achieve, okay?"}, {"time": 4107, "text": "In humans, that would be a psychopath."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "And then the third way you can be stupid is that you have the right model,
