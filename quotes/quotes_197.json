thousands, millions of years, which means that we're in the dynamic in our mind is a kind of an us versus them dynamic where our tribe is the people, and everybody else are whatever, you know?"}, {"time": 354, "text": "And I don't see that, I don't think that's changed one iota over the centuries."}, {"time": 361, "text": "It's just a question of how one might sublimate that urge to compete."}, {"time": 370, "text": "When you're a martial artist, you know, a great part of your day I'm sure is dedicated to reaching that place of total commitment and in the face of competition, in the face of adversity, et cetera, et cetera, which is, I think, natural and great for the human race on an individual basis."}, {"time": 421, "text": "So you think war was inevitable, it's a part of human nature as opposed to a force, a creative force in society that served a benefit."}, {"time": 461, "text": "And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let's say, there were, who knows, over the face of the earth, hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan, you know, Asia, Europe, wherever, and every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that."}, {"time": 484, "text": "That seems to be a universal human imperative, at least in the male of the species."}, {"time": 494, "text": "The war is just a realization of that imperative."}, {"time": 498, "text": "So you've written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae, you've about Alexander the Great, about the Six Day War in 67 in Israel, against Egypt, Jordan, Syria."}, {"time": 510, "text": "What war, not just out of those, but in general, do you think has been most transformative for the world?"}, {"time": 518, "text": "Well, these are great questions, Lex."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Tough, easy ones, right?"}, {"time": 522, "text": "I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols, because I certainly, from what little I know, I think that was a very, their conquests were very transformative, bringing cultures in a horrible, bloody way together."}, {"time": 540, "text": "But gosh, what's then the most transformative?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "Maybe the Roman conquest, establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture."}, {"time": 550, "text": "Maybe Alexander the Great's wars that united east and west, at least for a minute."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So building of empire."}, {"time": 560, "text": "Do you have a sense, so there's wars, I mean, the Six Day War is not about building empires."}, {"time": 570, "text": "It's about deeply held religious, cultural conflict and holding the line, holding the border."}, {"time": 582, "text": "And then there is conquests, like the Mongols, that, what is it, some large percentage of the population is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right?"}, {"time": 592, "text": "So that has transformative effects."}, {"time": 594, "text": "And then World War II, I mean, personally, and my family and so on, had transformative effects."}, {"time": 599, "text": "Let me ask you this, Lex."}, {"time": 601, "text": "Why are you, what are you trying to get at with these questions?"}, {"time": 604, "text": "What is this kind of the theme that you're aiming at?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein, and he said everything is great about war except the killing."}, {"time": 615, "text": "And there's a romantic notion of war."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior, but there's a romantic notion of war that somehow there's a creative force to it, that because we fight, out of that fighting comes culture, comes music and art, and more and more desire to create with the societies that win."}, {"time": 645, "text": "And to me, war is not just, hey, I have a stick and I want your land."}, {"time": 653, "text": "It's some kind of, like it has echoes of the creative force that makes humans unique to other animals."}, {"time": 665, "text": "Like, war is, it can't be just four people or 10 people or 100 people."}, {"time": 671, "text": "You have to have thousands of people agreeing, usually thousands or more, for something so deeply that you would be willing to risk your own life."}, {"time": 682, "text": "And there's a romantic notion to that."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And because you've written so well and passionate about some of these, I wanted to see, because I don't have any answers, I wanted to untangle that."}, {"time": 692, "text": "If there is a reason we fight that's more than just anger and hate and a way to conquer."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Well, let me take it from a completely different side."}, {"time": 707, "text": "I don't think that I, in writing about war, am really that interested in war per se."}, {"time": 715, "text": "I'm more interested in the metaphor."}, {"time": 718, "text": "I think for me, I'm really writing about my own internal war and the war against myself and against my own resistance, my own negativity, all of those things that spirituality would be the opposite of."}, {"time": 740, "text": "So I'm not really an expert on war."}, {"time": 743, "text": "It's not like talking to Jim Mattis or to Victor Davis Hanson or whatever."}, {"time": 745, "text": "To me, the human being, we are spiritual beings in a physical envelope."}, {"time": 763, "text": "And there's an automatic terrible tension within that."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And which creates a war inside ourselves."}, {"time": 773, "text": "So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army standing up to, whatever, 10 to one odds or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me of the fight we're fighting inside ourselves."}, {"time": 790, "text": "For me, the six day war was, as you know, my feeling was it was about a return from exile."}, {"time": 795, "text": "It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment of the state of Israel, which had never really been completed because the holiest places of the Jewish people were in the hands of their enemies."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So that would go along with what you're saying, Lex, of a certain creativity to it."}, {"time": 860, "text": "But again, that's not, for whatever, and I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this, that's not really what's interesting to me about these stories."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae, that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war."}, {"time": 877, "text": "That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death for a greater cause, just like, to me, the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual, a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good."}, {"time": 897, "text": "I don't know if that answers your question, but that's how I see it."}, {"time": 901, "text": "I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time, and I decline because I don't really feel like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class or anything like that."}, {"time": 918, "text": "That's not what's interesting about it to me."}, {"time": 924, "text": "But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor, that we're all essentially, in various ways, warriors?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "But at some point, that archetype, we move beyond that archetype, and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And then there are many archetypes beyond that towards the end."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So I'm interested in the warrior archetype, but not to the be all and end all of everything else."}, {"time": 990, "text": "In my book, The Virtues of War, have you read that?"}, {"time": 994, "text": "Well, there's a character named Telamon, who's actually, it's a long story, but when he's with Alexander's army, and when they arrive in India, he becomes fascinated by the gymnosophists, the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And he says to Alexander that these guys are warriors beyond what we are, even though they do nothing because they are inside their own selves all day long."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "If we go to the Six Day War, you write about, in Lionsgate, you write about the Six Day War in Israel."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "I think of the wars you've written about as the one we're still in many ways in the midst of today."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?"}, {"time": 1055, "text": "The Israeli Palestinian conflict?"}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I mean, today it's the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but it echoes of the same conflict in that part of the world with Israel."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "What is, in your sense, the nature of that conflict?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "What can we learn about society and human nature from that conflict?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "That is one of the hottest conflicts that still goes on today."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate about the Six Day War, I wrote in the introduction that this was not gonna be a multi sided story."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "I was taking it entirely, I'm a Jew, I identify with the Israeli people, I was gonna see it entirely from their side."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "So that's probably not what you're asking, but to me, the Six Day War and that whole, it's a piece of land that's holy to at least three religions and probably more."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And from the Jewish point of view, it's where the state of Israel, it's where David founded Jerusalem, it's all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera, where Moses came and brought the people."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So to me, the Six Day War was about, as I said, a return from exile, from diaspora after 2000 years."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever, it's a whole other scenario."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways, but religious beliefs."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "I mean, again, what is a Jew?"}, {"time": 1163, "text": "Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion or is it somebody of a certain race that race arose in a certain place?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "Same thing as a Muslim."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "What is a Muslim?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Or did they arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity?"}, {"time": 1180, "text": "Because if we landed from Mars, we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Just looking at them, you could easily mix them and you'd never know."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And the specifics of the faith is not necessarily the thing that defines a person."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So you could be, like many are, secular Jew living in Israel and still have a strong bond."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "Definitely, definitely."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "In fact, almost all of the Jews, the fighters that I spoke to from the Six Day War were secular and it really was not a religious thing with them as much as it was a national thing."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So having spent time in Israel, how's the world where military conflict is directly felt as opposed to maybe if we look at the US where it's distant and far away?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "How is that world different?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "How are the people different?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It's very different, as you know."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "I've never been to Israel, actually."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Oh, you haven't?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "I haven't felt it."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "Ah, well, you should definitely go."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "I mean, here in the United States, where when an incident like Charlottesville comes up, where people are chanting, Jews will not replace us, blah, blah, blah, the impulse in the Jewish community is to think of, well, how can we reach out to the other side?"}, {"time": 1265, "text": "How can we show them that we are human beings like they are and show them that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "That's the sort of distant from war."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "From, if you're in Israel, like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now, you would be a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "You would not just be working at MIT or whatever."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And I would be in the army too."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And so from their point of view, they say all those people who hate us, can I curse on this?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Can I curse on this thing?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Fuck them, we'll kill them."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "We'll kill them."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "If they dared to cross the line, and that's their whole different point of view."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "To me, it's actually a healthier point of view."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So there's no, so let me ask the hard question is, well, maybe it's an impossible question is, how do we resolve that conflict?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "In Israel and?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "In Israel or?"}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Anywhere?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US and say, F you and the people, yeah."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "Here's my, I think that the only way that two warring sides or two sides that are opposed to one another can ever really come together is when there's mutual respect, we'll get just more water."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "I got it, I got this."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "When there's mutual respect and they can see each other as equals and when there's mutual fear, you know, where one side says, we don't dare cross the line with this other side, and the other side says the same thing."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I think then you can kind of reach across that thing and say, okay, we'll stay here, you stay here."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "We'll mingle in cultural ways and we'll have interchange, you know, winter marriage, da, da, da, da, da, da."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "But as soon as one side has no power, as the Jewish people have had no power throughout the diaspora forever, right?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Then it's just a human nature."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "You can see it in Trump and what he does to any vulnerable minority, right?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And he's not alone."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "I'm not blaming him alone."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "That's human nature."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So I do think that that idea of like, fuck you, if you cross the line, we'll kill you, is really a good way, is a good place to start from."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table and say, you know, what do we have in common?"}, {"time": 1413, "text": "How can we, we want to raise our children."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "You want to raise your children."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "How can we do this in a way that we're not hurting each other?"}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So you kind of said that you need to arrive at a balance, some kind of balance of power."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "But you haven't spoken to the fact that there's deeply rooted hatred of the other."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So is there no way to alleviate that hatred?"}, {"time": 1437, "text": "Or is that, I mean, what role does love and hate come?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "I think that hatred can go away."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "I mean, if you look at even now that I haven't seen this in person, but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis are collaborating in certain things, you know, by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "I do think that even really long, long, longstanding hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old, can go away under the right circumstances."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "In a, on what time scale?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I mean, for instance, I don't know if there's some, do people have to die?"}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Do generations have to die and pass away and new generations come up with less hate?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Or can a single individual learn to not hate?"}, {"time": 1487, "text": "I think a single individual can learn to not hate because it certainly doesn't seem to, over thousands of years, doesn't seem to work."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "You know, we keep thinking that that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "But I think it's, we're in a real spiritual realm here when you're talking about that."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "You're in a realm of, you know, Buddha, Jesus, whatever, something like that, that where, you know, a true change of soul happens."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "But I do think that's possible."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "So what do you think is the future of warfare?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Especially with what many people see as the expansion of the military industrial conflict."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "To what, do you, I know you're not a military historian."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I'm asking more as a metaphor."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And do you see us as people continuing to fight?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "You know, it's a really great question, Alex, because I think now with social media, TV, movies, all of these things that create empathy across cultures, it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think, to totally demonize the other, the way it was in previous wars."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "I also think, I don't really see an appetite for people wanting to go to war these days."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "And in a way, I don't know if that's good or bad."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It's like everybody's so fat and lazy and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting that, you know, whereas I know at the start of World War I, both the younger generations were eager to go to war."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "You know, I think it was insane, but it was that sort of warrior archetype that we were talking about before that, that generational testosterone eros thing."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "Whereas nowadays, I don't know."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "I mean, it's hard to say there's not gonna be another war because there always are, but it's sort of hard to imagine people getting off their ass these days to do anything."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media as a place for empathy, sure."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But in a sense, it's a place for war as well."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "For hatred, yeah, true."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "For hatred."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And so it kind of dissipates sort of the hatefuls."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "You get the hate out at a less, on a daily basis and thereby never boils up to a point where you want to kill."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "It's also a really weird thing that's going on that I don't know if anybody really understands, like with video games where kids are acting out these incredible horror things, right?"}, {"time": 1669, "text": "But you know that if they cut their finger, they would like freak out, you know?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And I also don't think that many of the people that are hateful on social media, if they were face to face with the person, they wouldn't."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "So there's a sort of two mental spheres happening at the same time."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And I don't know how that plays out."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "Maps to the actual military, how that actually maps to military conflict."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Like if you in the United States have a draft, for example, how the populace would respond different than they did in previous generations."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Yeah, I think they certainly would."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Another question, not sure if you've thought about it, but I work on building artificial intelligence systems."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "In our community, many people are worried about AI being used in war."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "So automating the killing process with drones and in general, it's being used more and more."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I should recuse myself on that one."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "I really haven't thought about that one."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "You haven't thought about it."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "I'd rather ask you what you think about it."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "Well, it's interesting, I mean, because it's so fundamentally different from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "It means just if we talk about the difference between a gun and a sword."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "I'll tell you one little anecdote."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "There was a Spartan king, I don't know which one it was, but at one point they showed him a new invention and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone at a range of 200 yards."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And the king wept and said, alas, valor is no more."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Because their point of view of war, it was highly ritualized, as you know, and the code of honor was that you were not supposed to be able to kill another person unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "And any other way of doing that, even bow and arrow was considered less than manly and less than honorable."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And maybe we should go back to that because at least it makes the stakes real and true."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Not that we could."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Not that's the point."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "You were in the Marine Corps, so we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts that you've written about, many of them."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So let me ask a personal question."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "Have you, sort of as a writing and in general, have you thought about what it takes to kill a person if you yourself could do it in the war?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "I have thought about it, yeah."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And how that would make you feel?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Of course, one never knows."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "I certainly, I have not been in combat."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "I haven't killed anybody."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "But I would imagine in the real world that it would change you utterly forever."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Because you can't help but identify with the person that you've just killed."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And it's another human being."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "And I mean, I have a hard time killing a spider."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "So I would imagine that it's something that warriors understand and nobody else understands."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And you've spoken with many."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "How, I mean, you've spoken with people who've seen military combat in Israel."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "What, have they been able to articulate the experience of killing?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It's sort of just what I said."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot that I interviewed over there who was strafing a tank in his Mustang and saw, at really low altitude, and saw what his bullets did to the guy and could see his face and everything like that, which is even one remove or more removes from an infantryman, what an infantryman does."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And he said that same thing that I said, that it just changes you and you can never say it, never look at the world or look at anything the same way again."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And when that happens at scale, it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "That changes entire societies."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "I mean, that's what we've seen."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "At least it, but the problem is it doesn't change the politicians back home."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "How important is mortality, finiteness, the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?"}, {"time": 1952, "text": "So, killing and war really emphasizes that, but in general, the fact that this thing ends."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "It does?"}, {"time": 1963, "text": "It does, and uh."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Shit."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And on a serious note, do you think about your own mortality?"}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Do you meditate on your own mortality when you think about the work you do?"}, {"time": 1977, "text": "That's another great question, Lex."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "I actually, I'm 75, and I just was having, I had breakfast in New York a few months ago with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And I said to him, I said, Nick, do you ever think about mortality?"}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And he said, every fucking minute of every day."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "But actually, I always have, I think."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And I think, you know, the fact of mortality gives meaning to life, you know?"}, {"time": 2012,
