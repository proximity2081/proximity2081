you know the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those and then you follow through and do the designs you set out to do and it's the experimentation."}, {"time": 383, "text": "I think that what happens to people mostly is that they try to decide whether they're gonna be successful or not ahead of doing it and they don't know how to do the process well because the nature of your questions are along those lines like how do you know?"}, {"time": 400, "text": "Well, you don't know, but a practical person who is also used to making dreams happen knows how to do that process."}, {"time": 408, "text": "I've given personality tests to shapers."}, {"time": 412, "text": "So the person, what I mean by a shaper is a person who can take something from visualization, they have an audacious goal and then they go from visualization to actualization, building it out."}, {"time": 458, "text": "So the call to adventure, the adventure starts not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation but using what, instinct?"}, {"time": 468, "text": "How do you dive in?"}, {"time": 469, "text": "So let's talk about."}, {"time": 470, "text": "It is being a, it's simultaneously being a dreamer and a realist, it's to know how to do that well."}, {"time": 478, "text": "The pull comes from a pull to adventure."}, {"time": 481, "text": "For whatever reason, I can't tell you how much of it's genetics and how much is environment but there's a early on, it's exciting."}, {"time": 491, "text": "That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting and so one feels that, then one gets in the habit of doing that, okay, how do I know?"}, {"time": 501, "text": "How do I learn very well and then how do I imagine and then how do I experiment to go from that imagination?"}, {"time": 510, "text": "So it's that process that one, and then one, the more one does it, the better one becomes at it."}, {"time": 520, "text": "You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates."}, {"time": 524, "text": "What, who are the shapers that you find yourself thinking about when you're constructing these ideas?"}, {"time": 531, "text": "The ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you."}, {"time": 534, "text": "Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody who comes up with a great visualization, usually a really unique visualization and then actually builds it out and makes the world different, changes the world in that kind of a way."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce, Chris Anderson with TED, Mohammed Yunus with social enterprise and philanthropy, Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children's Zone, there are, all domains have shapers who have the ability to visualize and make extraordinary things happen."}, {"time": 572, "text": "What are the commonalities between some of them?"}, {"time": 575, "text": "The commonalities are, first of all, the excitement of something new, that call to adventure, and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn."}, {"time": 587, "text": "The capacity then, they're able to be, in many ways, full rage."}, {"time": 593, "text": "That means they're able to go from the big, big picture down to the detail."}, {"time": 599, "text": "So let's say, for example, Elon Musk, he describes, he gets a lot of money from selling PayPal, his interest in PayPal."}, {"time": 609, "text": "He said, why isn't anybody going to Mars or outer space?"}, {"time": 614, "text": "What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?"}, {"time": 616, "text": "And how are we gonna get that?"}, {"time": 618, "text": "And nobody's paying attention to that."}, {"time": 619, "text": "He doesn't know much about it."}, {"time": 621, "text": "He then reads and learns and so on."}, {"time": 624, "text": "Says, I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money, and I'm gonna put it in there, and I'm gonna do this thing, and he learns, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's got creative, okay."}, {"time": 633, "text": "That's one dimension."}, {"time": 635, "text": "So he gave me the keys to his car, but this was just early days in Tesla, and he then points out the details."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Okay, if you push this button here, it's this, the detail that, so he's simultaneously talking about the big, the big, big, big picture."}, {"time": 656, "text": "Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?"}, {"time": 659, "text": "But he will then be able to take it down into the detail so he can go, let's call it helicoptering."}, {"time": 666, "text": "He can go up, he can go down, and see things at those types of perspective."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And then you've seen that with the other shapers."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And that's a common thing that they can do that."}, {"time": 674, "text": "Another important difference that they have in mind is how they deal with people."}, {"time": 681, "text": "I mean, meaning there's nothing more important than achieving the mission."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And so what they have in common is that there's a test that I give these personality tests, because they're very helpful for understanding people."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And so I gave it to all these shapers."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And one of the things in workplace inventory test is this test, and it has a category called concern for others."}, {"time": 705, "text": "They're all having concern for others."}, {"time": 709, "text": "This includes Muhammad Yunus, who invented microfinance, social enterprise, impact investing, as Muhammad Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for this, the Congressional Medal of Honor."}, {"time": 721, "text": "One of the, a fortune determined, one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time."}, {"time": 728, "text": "He's built all sorts of businesses to give back money in social enterprise, a remarkable man."}, {"time": 734, "text": "He has nobody that I know practically could have more concern for others."}, {"time": 740, "text": "He lives a life of a saint."}, {"time": 742, "text": "I mean, a very modest lifestyle, and he puts all his money into trying to help others."}, {"time": 747, "text": "And he tests low on what's called concern for others, because what it really, those questions under that are questions about conflict to get at the mission."}, {"time": 756, "text": "So they all, Jeffrey Canada, who changed Harlem Children's Zone and developed that to take children in Harlem and get them well taken care of, not only just in their education, but their whole lives."}, {"time": 767, "text": "Harlem, him also, concern for others."}, {"time": 769, "text": "What they mean is that they can see whether though individuals are performing at a level that an extremely high level that's necessary to make those dreams happen."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So when you think of, let's say Steve Jobs was famous for being difficult with people and so on, and I didn't know Steve Jobs, so I can't speak personally to that, but his comments on, do you have A players?"}, {"time": 795, "text": "And if you have A players, if you put in B players, pretty soon you'll have C players and so on."}, {"time": 799, "text": "That is a common element of them, holding people to high standards and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission."}, {"time": 808, "text": "What do you think about that kind of idea?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Sorry to pause on that for a second, that the A, B, and C players, and the importance of, so when you have a mission, to really only have A players and be sort of aggressively filtering for that?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "Yes, but I think that there are all different ways of being A players."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And I think, in order to grade a great team, you have to appreciate all the differences in ways of being A players, okay?"}, {"time": 839, "text": "That's the first thing."}, {"time": 840, "text": "And then you always have to be super excellent, in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent with people to help them understand each other themselves and get in sync with them about what's true about them and their circumstances and how they're doing, so that they're having a fabulous personal development experience at the same time as you're dealing with them."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So when I say that they're all different ways, this is one of the then qualities, you asked me what are the qualities."}, {"time": 909, "text": "Brilliant, so how do you win that personality being first of all, open to the fact that there's other people see things differently than you, and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision?"}, {"time": 922, "text": "Is there just the psychology of that?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "Do you see a tension there between the confidence and the open mindedness?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "No, it's funny because I think we grow up thinking that there's a tension there, right?"}, {"time": 933, "text": "That there's a confidence and the more confidence that you have, there's a tension with the open mindedness and not being sure, okay?"}, {"time": 943, "text": "Confident and accurate are almost negatively correlated to many people."}, {"time": 950, "text": "They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate."}, {"time": 953, "text": "And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people is not realizing how those things to go together because instead it's really that by saying I know a lot and how do I know I'm still not wrong?"}, {"time": 968, "text": "And how do I take that the best thinking available to me and then raise my probability of learning?"}, {"time": 976, "text": "All these people think for themselves, okay?"}, {"time": 1009, "text": "So the reason my company has been successful in terms of this is because of an idea meritocratic decision making a process by which you can get the best ideas."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "You know, what's an idea meritocracy?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas that are available out there and to work together with other people in the team to achieve that."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "That's an incredible process that you describe in several places to arrive at the truth, but I apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion, but let me linger on it."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "Just having enough self belief, you don't think there's a self delusion there that's necessary, especially in the beginning."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "You talk about in the journey, maybe the trials or the abyss."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Do you think there is value to diluting yourself?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "I think what you're calling delusion is a bad word for uncertainty, okay?"}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So in other words, because we keep coming back to the question, how would you know and all of those things?"}, {"time": 1075, "text": "No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you, that you have to find out truth, okay?"}, {"time": 1081, "text": "To deal with uncertainty, not saying, listen, I have this dream and I don't know how I'm going to get that dream."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I mentioned in my book principles and described the process in a more complete way than we're gonna be able to go here."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "But what happens is I say, you form your dreams first and you can't judge whether you're going to achieve those dreams because you haven't learned the things that you're going to learn on the way toward those dreams, okay?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "So that isn't delusion."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "I wouldn't use delusion."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "I think you're overemphasizing the importance of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "Get rid of that, okay?"}, {"time": 1123, "text": "If you can get rid of that and say, okay, no, I can have that dream, but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding out."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "I'm curious, I'm a great learner, I'm a great experimenter."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Along the way, you'll do those experiments which will teach you more truths and more learning about the reality so that you can get your dreams."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And you think delusion's helpful."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "No, the delusion isn't."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Don't confuse delusion with not knowing."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Yes, but nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss, we can look at your own that you describe."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "It's difficult psychologically for people."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So many people quit."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "Many people choose a path that is more comfortable."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "The heartbreak of that breaks people."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "So if you have the dream and there's this cycle of learning, setting a goal, and so on, what's your value for the psychology of just being broken by these difficult moments?"}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Well, that's classically the defining moment."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "It's almost like evolution taking care of, okay, now you crash, you're in the abyss."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Oh my God, that's bad."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And then the question is, what do you do?"}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And it sorts people, okay?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And some people get off the field and they say, oh, I don't like this and so on."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis and it changes their approach to learning."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "You should take an audacious dreamer, guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay, and then come out of that crashing and saying, okay, I can be audacious and scared that I'm gonna be wrong at the same time."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And then how do I do that?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Because that's the key."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "When you don't lose your audaciousness and you keep going after your big goal, and at the same time you say, hey, I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong, you gain your radical open mindedness that allows you to take in the things, that allows you to go to the next level of being successful."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "So your own process, I mean, you've talked about it before, but it would be great if you can describe it because our darkest moments are perhaps the most interesting."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So your own with the prediction of another depression."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Economic depression."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Yes, I apologize, economic depression."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking, planning, strategizing at those moments?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?"}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Building my little company."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "This is in 1981, 82."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "I had calculated that American banks had given a lot more money to, lent a lot more money to Latin American countries than those countries were gonna pay back, and that they would have a debt crisis, and that this had sent the economy tumbling, and that was an extremely controversial point of view."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Then it started to happen, and it happened, and Mexico defaulted in August 1982."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "I thought that there was gonna be an economic collapse that was gonna follow because there was a series of the other countries, it was just playing out as I had imagined, and that couldn't have been more wrong."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "That was the exact bottom in the stock market because central banks eased monetary policy, blah, blah, blah, and I couldn't have been more wrong, and I was very publicly wrong and all of that, and I lost money for me, and I lost money for my clients, and I only had a small company then, but these were close people, I had to let them go."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "I was down to me as the last person."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to help to pay for my family bills, very painful, and at the same time, I would say it definitely was one of the best things that ever happened to me, maybe the best thing from happened to me, because it changed my approach to decision making."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "It's what I'm saying."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "In other words, I kept saying, okay, how do I know whether I'm right?"}, {"time": 1381, "text": "How do I know I'm not wrong?"}, {"time": 1382, "text": "It gave me that, and it didn't give up my audaciousness because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Am I gonna go back, put on a tie, go to Wall Street and just do those things?"}, {"time": 1396, "text": "No, I can't bring myself to do that, so I'm at a juncture."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties, and that taught me, for example, a number of techniques."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "First, to find the smartest people I could find who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "I learned how to produce diversification."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "I learned how to do a number of things."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And by doing that, then that was the key to our success."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "And the things that I wanna pass along to people, the reason I'm doing this podcast with you is I'm 70 years old, and that is a magical way of achieving success."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "If you can create an idea meritocracy, it's so much better in terms of achieving success and also quality relationships with people, but that's what that experience gave me."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So if we can linger on a little bit longer, the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating, but especially because it seems to be rare, not just in companies, but in society."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So there is a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse and politics and so on that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas, whatever they are."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "So when you're confronted with an idea that's different than your own about a particular topic, what kind of process do you go through mentally?"}, {"time": 1512, "text": "Are you arguing through the idea with the person, sort of present is almost like a debate, or do you sit on it and consider the world sort of empathetically?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "If this is true, then what does that world look like?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "Does that world make sense and so on?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So what's the process of considering those conflicting ideas for you?"}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I'm gonna answer that question, but after saying first, almost implicit in your question is it's not common, okay?"}, {"time": 1542, "text": "What's common produces only common results, okay?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So don't judge anything that is good based on whether it's common, because it's only gonna give you common results."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?"}, {"time": 1557, "text": "And so that art of thoughtful disagreement is the capacity to hold two things in your mind at the same time."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "The, gee, I think this makes sense, and then saying, I'm not sure it makes sense, and then try to say, why does it make sense?"}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And then to triangulate with others."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "So if I'm having a discussion like that and I work myself through and I'm not sure, then I have to do that in a good way."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So I always give attention, for example, let's start off, what does the other person know relative to what I know?"}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So if a person has a higher expertise or things, I'm much more inclined to ask questions."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "I'm always asking questions."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "If you wanna learn, you're asking questions, you're not arguing, okay?"}, {"time": 1608, "text": "You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Does that make sense?"}, {"time": 1613, "text": "Are you learning something?"}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Are you getting epiphanies and so on?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And I try to then do that if the conversation, as we're trying to decide what is true, and we're trying to do that together, and we see truth different, then I might even call in another really smart, capable person and try to say, what is true and how do we explore that together?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And you go through that same thing."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So I would, I said, I describe it as having open mindedness and assertiveness at the same time, that you can simultaneously be open minded and take in with that curiosity and then also be assertive and say, but that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Why would this be the case?"}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And you do that back and forth."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And when you're doing that kind of back and forth on a topic like the economy, which you have, to me, perhaps I'm naive, but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex, the economy, the trading, the transactions, that these transactions between two individuals somehow add up to this giant mechanism."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "You've put out a 30 minute video."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "You have a lot of incredible videos online that people should definitely watch on YouTube, but you've put out this 30 minute video titled How the Economic Machine Works."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "That is probably one of the best, if not the best video I've seen on the internet in terms of educational videos."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So people should definitely watch it, especially because it's not that the individual components of the video are somehow revolutionary, but the simplicity and the clarity of the different components just makes you, there's a few light bulb moments there about how the economy works as a machine."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So as you described, there's three main forces that drive the economy, productivity growth, short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "The former, productivity growth is how valuable things, how much value people create, valuable things people create."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "The latter is people borrowing from their future selves to hopefully create those valuable things faster."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "So this is an incredible system to me."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Maybe we can linger on it a little bit, but you've also said what most people think about as money is actually credit."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "Total amount of money is $3 trillion."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "That's just crazy to me."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me, but that seems crazy."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "It gives me just positive human civilization has been able to create a system that has so much credit."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So that's a long way to ask, do you think credit is good or bad for society?"}, {"time": 1785, "text": "That system of that's so fundamentally based on credit."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "I think credit is great, even though people often overdo it."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Credit is that somebody has earned money."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And what happens is they lend it to somebody else who's got better ideas and they cut a deal."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And then that person with the better ideas is gonna pay it back."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "And if it works well, it helps resource allocations go well, providing people like the entrepreneurs and all of those, they need capital."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "They don't have capital themselves."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And so somebody is gonna give them capital and they'll give them credit along those lines."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "Then what happens is it's not managed well in a variety of ways."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "So I did another book on principles, principles of big debt crises that go into that."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And it's free, by the way, I put it free online as a PDF."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So if you go online and you look principles of a big debt crisis is under my name, you can download it in a PDF or you can buy a print book of it."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And it goes through that particular process."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "And so you always have it overdone in always the same way."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "Everything, by the way, almost everything happens over and over again for the same reasons, okay?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again for the same reasons."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "They get it overdone."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "In the book, it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And then you go through the process of making the adjustments according that and it explains how they can use the levers and so on."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "If you didn't have credit, then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So credit is a good thing, but it can easily be overdone."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "So now we get into the, what is money?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "What is credit?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "Okay, you get into money and credit."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile, keep in mind that the central bank, let's say it can print the money."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "What is that problem?"}, {"time": 1911, "text": "You have an IOU and the IOU says you're gonna get a certain number of dollars, let's say, or yen or

also you have a government, which is a participant in that process because they are on the hook, they owe money."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "And then will they print the money to make it easy for everybody to pay?"}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So you have to pay attention to those two."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I would suggest like you recommend to other people, just take that 30 minutes and it comes across pretty clearly."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "But my conclusion is that of course you want it."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "And even if you understand it and the cycles well, you can benefit from those cycles rather than to be hurt by those cycles."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Because I don't know the way the cycle works is somebody gets over indebted, they have to sell an asset."},

1987, "text": "So you've mentioned credit and money."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Another thing that if I just zoom out from an alien perspective and look at human civilization, it's incredible that we've created a thing that only works because currency, because we all agree it has value."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "So I guess my question is how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon?"}, {"time": 2018, "text": "And what do you think is the future of money?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "What do you think is its history and future?"}, {"time": 2028, "text": "How do you think about money?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "There are two things that money is for."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So money, so you could say something's a medium of exchange, and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?"}, {"time": 2051,

2066, "text": "So that's that process."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And it's, I apologize to interrupt, but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth when everybody recognizes it to be of value."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And so you see in the history around the world and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific in which they had as money these big stones."}, {"time": 2121,

"And then we go through then the history of money and the vulnerabilities of money."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And what we have is there's, through history, there's been two types of money."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Those that are claims on something of value, like the connection to gold or something."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "That would be."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Or they just are money without any connection, and then we have a system now, which is a fiat monetary system."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So that's what money is."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "Then it will last as long as it's kept a value and it works that way."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So let's say central banks, when they get in the position of like they owe a lot of money, like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case, and they also in our mind and they have the printing press to print the money and get out of that."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "And you have a lot of people might be in that position."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And so history has shown, forget about today, history has shown that no currency, every currency has either ended as being a currency or devalued as a currency over periods of time, long periods of time."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So it evolves and it changes, but

what do you think, well, do you think something like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value, a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?"}, {"time": 2257, "text": "The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not an effective medium of exchange."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Like it's not easy for me to go in there and buy things with it."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "And then it's not an effective storehold of value because it has a volatility that's based on speculation and the like, so it's not a very effective saving."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "That's very different from Facebook's of a stable value currency, which would be effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "Because if you were to hold it and the way it's linked to number of things that it's linked to would mean that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And then you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium exchange and storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So in my opinion, some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or less based on that ability to do it."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Then the question is what happens?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Okay, what happens is do central banks allow that to happen?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "Okay, a better force of money that the central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "But then that's not yet happened."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And we also have to, and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "In order to go through that evolutionary process, first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen, which is to some extent a threat to them in terms of their power."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "And that's an issue."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "And then you have to also build the confidence in all of the components of it to say, okay, that's going to be effective because I won't have problems owning it."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So I think that digital currencies have some element of potential, but there's a lot of hurdles that are going to have to be gotten over."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "I think that it'll be a very long time, possibly never, but anyway, a very long time before we have that, let's say, get into a position that would be effective means relative to gold, let's say, if you were to think of that."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Because gold has a track record of thousands of years."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "All across countries, it has its mobility, it has the ability to put it down, it has certain abilities."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies, but central banks will hold it."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Like there's central banks that worry about others, other countries, central banks might worry about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And so the thing they're going to go to is not going to be the digital currency."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else, some other currency, they got to pick it."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And so I think it's a long way to go."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "Well, you think it's possible that one day we don't even have a central bank because of a currency that doesn't, that cannot be controlled by the central bank is the primary currency?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Or does that seem very unlikely?"}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It would be very remote possibility or very long in the future."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "When you sit back and you look, you describe these transactions between individuals, somehow creating short term debt

entries."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2521, "text": "And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears and it all happens."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "And what I marvel at that and those types of things is because of the capacity of the human mind to create abstractions that are true."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level and then if these things are true, then you go to the next level and if those things are true, then you go to the next level."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And all those miracles that we almost become common, it's like when I'm flying in a plane or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "When I get communications in the middle of, I don't know, Africa or Antarctica and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "So while being amazing, do you have a sense, the principles you described, that the whole thing is stable somehow also?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Or is this, are we just lucky?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So the principles that you described, are those describing a system that is stable, robust and will remain so?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Or is it a lucky

the plane is gonna fall out of the sky because of its particular fundamentals."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I don't know enough about that but it happens over and over again and so on, it gives me faith, okay?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So without me knowing it."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "In the markets and the economy, I know those things well enough, in a sense, to say that by and large, that structure is right, what we're seeing is right."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Now, whether there are disruptions and it has effects that can come, not because that structure is right, and I believe it's right, but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity or journal entries, they could take all the money away from you through your digital entries."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways that means that that money is worthless or the system falls but from what I see in terms of its basic structure and those complexities that still take my breath away, I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them, that doesn't worry me."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime that really surprised you?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Major disruptions?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Oh, all the time."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "This is one of the great lessons of my life is that many times I've seen things that I was very surprised about and that I realized almost all of those I was surprised about because they just, they were just the first time it happened to me, they didn't happen in my lifetime before but when I researched them, they happened in other places or other people lifetimes."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "So for example, I remember 1971, the dollar, there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency, it didn't experience it and the dollar was connected to gold and I was watching events happen and then you get on and that definition of money all of a sudden went out the window because it was not tied to gold and then you have this devaluation."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock or so many of these things."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "But almost always I realized that they, when I looked in history, they happened before, they just happened in other people's lifetimes which led me to realize that I needed to study history and what happened in other people's lifetimes and what happened in other countries and places so that I would have timeless and universal principles for dealing with that thing."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So I've, oh yeah, I've been, you know, the implausible happening but it's like a one in a hundred year storm, okay?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "Or it's or."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "They've happened

decision making."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So for me, it's like there's a chess game playing and I'm a person with my chess game and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making the move and how do I compare those two moves?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "So we've done a lot but let me give you a rule."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "If the future can be different from the past and you don't have deep understanding, you should not rely on AI, okay?"}, {"time": 2879, "text": "Those two things."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Deep understanding of?"}, {"time": 2882, "text": "The cause of fact

how do I do surgeries?"}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I think it's a good idea to do surgeries but I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors do the surgeries."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "That appendicitis or whatever it is will be handled the same way, the surgery, that's fine."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "However, what happens with AI is for the most part is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size and then it puts together its own algorithms."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "You can either take your thinking and express them in algorithms or you can say, put the data in and say, what is the algorithm?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "That's machine learning."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "And when you have machine learning, it'll give you equations which quite often are not understandable."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "If you would try to say, okay, now describe what it's telling you, it's very difficult to describe and so they can escape understanding."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And so it's very good for doing those things that could be done over and over again if you're watching and you're not taking that."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "But if the future is different from the past and you have that, then if the future is different from the past and you don't have deep understanding,

ways, I think it's particularly good for processing."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "But the notion of what you want to do is better most of the time determined by the human mind."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "What are the principles?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Like, okay, how should I raise my children?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "It's gonna be a long time before AI, you're going to say, it has a good enough judgment to do that."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "Who should I marry?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "All of those things."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "Maybe you can get the computer to help you but if you just took data and do machine learning, it's not gonna find it."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "If you were to then take one of my criteria for any of those questions and then say, put them into an algorithm and you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But by and large, the mind should be used for inventing and those creative things."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And then the computer should be used for processing because it could process a lot more information, a lot faster, a lot more accurately and a lot less emotionally."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "So any notion of thinking in the form of processing type thinking should be done by a computer and anything that is in the notion of doing that other type of thinking should be operating with the brain, operating in a way where you can say, ah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "You know, the process of reducing your understanding down to principles is kind of like the process, the first one you mentioned, type of AI algorithm where you're encoding your expertise, you're trying to program, write a program, the human is trying to write a program."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "How do you think that's attainable?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "The process of reducing principles to a computer program or when you say, when you write about, when you think about principles, is there still a human element that's not reducible to an algorithm?"}, {"time": 3132, "text": "My experience has been that almost all things, including those things that I thought were pretty much impossible to express, I've been able to express in algorithms, but that doesn't constitute all things."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So you can express far more than you can imagine you'll be able to express."},

"text": "Okay, at what age, what school?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And the way to do that, in my experience, is to take that and when you're in the moment of making a decision or just past making a decision, to take the time and to write down your criteria for making that decision in words."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper."}, {"time": 3196,

get it on Android."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "It'll be, in a few months it'll be on Android."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "But it has an app in there that helps people write down their own principles."},

choosing the school for your child or whatever that might be, and you write down your criteria or whatever they are, those principles, you write down and that will at that moment make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And if you have the way that we operate that you have easy access, so then the next time that comes along, you can go to that, or you can show those principles to others to see if they're the right principles."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "You will get a clarity of that principle that's really invaluable in words and that'll help you a lot."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But then you start to think, how do I express that in data?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And it'll shock you about how you can do that."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "You'll form an equation that will show the relationship between these particular parts and then essentially the variables that are going to go into that particular equation and you will be able to do that."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And you take that little piece and you put it into the computer."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "And then take the next little piece and you put that into the computer."},

in outcomes for somebody who completes high school or doesn't complete high school, or does each one of those state changes."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And you look at what that means in terms of

can talk about UBI."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "Right, because you have to have that."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?"}, {"time": 4299, "text": "So when I look at UBI, I really think is what is going to happen with that $1,000, okay?"}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And will that $1,000 come from another program?"}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?"}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Who are you giving the $1,000 to and what will they do for that $1,000?"}, {"time": 4319, "text": "I mean, like my reaction would be, I think it's a great thing that everybody should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?"}, {"time": 4330, "text": "A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody and it could have a negative result."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "It can have, they can use that money detrimentally,

and give a check, doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good in providing those things that I think are so fundamental important."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it so when the time comes."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "Use it well, right."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And use it well, that would be really, really good because it's almost like everybody, you'd wish everybody could have $1,000 worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "And I think that would be great."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "But I wanna make sure that these other things that are taken care of."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So if it comes out of that budget and I don't want it to come out of that budget that's gonna be doing those things."},

wiggle room to use for the benefit of their children."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Wow, that sounds great."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "If you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic or drug
