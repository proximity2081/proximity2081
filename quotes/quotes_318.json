of bringing people back to life through artificial intelligence, sort of, I don't know if you've seen videos of basically animating people back to life, meaning whether it's, for me personally, I've been working on specifically about Albert Einstein, but also Alan Turing, Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And it's an opportunity to bring people that meant a lot to others in the world and animate them and be able to have a conversation with them at first to try to visually, visually explore the full richness of character that they had as they struggle with the ideas of the modern age."}, {"time": 380, "text": "Sort of, it's less about bringing back their mind and more bringing back the visual quirks that made them who they are."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And then maybe in the future, it's using the textual, the visual, the video, the audio data to actually compress down the person for who they are and be able to generate text."}, {"time": 402, "text": "There's a few companies, there's Replica, which is a chat engine that was born out of the idea of bringing, the founder lost her friend to, he got run over by a car."}, {"time": 415, "text": "And the initial reason she founded the company was trying to just have a conversation with her friend."}, {"time": 422, "text": "She trained machine learning, natural language system on the texts that they exchange with each other and try, she had a conversation with him sort of after he was gone."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And it's very, the conversation was very trivial."}, {"time": 436, "text": "It was obvious that it's AI agent, but it gave her solace."}, {"time": 443, "text": "It made her actually feel really good."}, {"time": 446, "text": "And that's the way I wonder if it's possible to bring back people that are, that mean something to us personally, not just Einstein, but people that we've lost and in that way achieve a kind of small artificial immortality."}, {"time": 462, "text": "I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 464, "text": "Well, I definitely think about a lot of things."}, {"time": 466, "text": "That one's a really good one."}, {"time": 467, "text": "There's a great Black Mirror episode about the wife who brings back the boyfriend or husband."}, {"time": 472, "text": "I think one of the challenges with bringing back Richard Feynman would be to capture his sense of humor, but that would be awesome."}, {"time": 479, "text": "But yeah, bringing back loved ones would be great, especially if they're young and they die early, though it may hold you back from moving on."}, {"time": 489, "text": "That's another thing that could happen as a negative."}, {"time": 491, "text": "But I think that's great."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And I also think that it's gonna be possible, especially when we're recording some of us, every aspect of our lives, whether it's our face or things we see, right?"}, {"time": 502, "text": "Eventually one day, everything we see can be recorded."}, {"time": 506, "text": "And then you can build somebody's experience and thoughts, speech, and you will have replicas of everybody, at least digitally, and physically you could do that too one day."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But that's a good idea, especially because there are people that I'd like to meet, and I think it's easier than building a time machine."}, {"time": 524, "text": "One person I'd love to meet is Benjamin Franklin."}, {"time": 528, "text": "Well, I wouldn't go back in time."}, {"time": 530, "text": "I would, but I'd prefer to bring him into the future and say, can you believe we have this thinking machine in our pockets now?"}, {"time": 538, "text": "And just see the look on his face as to where humanity has come."}, {"time": 541, "text": "Because I think of him as a modern guy that just was before his time."}, {"time": 545, "text": "Yeah, so you're thinking Benjamin Franklin the scientist, not Benjamin Franklin the political thing."}, {"time": 550, "text": "Because he'd be very upset with Congress right now."}, {"time": 553, "text": "So maybe talk to him about science and technology, not politics."}, {"time": 558, "text": "Or maybe just don't get him on Twitter because he'll be very upset with human civilization."}, {"time": 562, "text": "You know, I wonder what their personalities are like."}, {"time": 565, "text": "Isaac Newton, it does seem complicated to figure out what their personality is like."}, {"time": 570, "text": "Even Friedrich Nietzsche, who I also thought about."}, {"time": 573, "text": "Feynman is, we just have enough video where we get the full kind of, I mean, it shows you how important it is to get not the official kind of book level presentation of a human, but the authentic, the full spectrum of humanity."}, {"time": 591, "text": "You mentioned collecting data about a person, collecting the whole thing, the whole of life, the ups and downs, the embarrassing stuff, the beautiful stuff, not just the things that's condensed into a book."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And then with Feynman, you start to see that a little bit."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Through conversations, you start to see peaks of like that genius."}, {"time": 609, "text": "And then through stories about him from others."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And then certainly you, the sad thing about Alan Turing, for example, is there's very little, if any, recording of him."}, {"time": 622, "text": "In fact, I haven't been able to find recording allegedly there's supposed to be a recording of him doing some kind of a radio broadcast, but I haven't been able to find anything."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And so that's truly sad that it feels like it makes you realize how the upside, how nice it is to collect data about a person, to capture that person."}, {"time": 646, "text": "That's the upside of the modern internet age, the digital age, that that information, yeah, creates a kind of immortality."}, {"time": 655, "text": "And then you can choose to highlight the best parts of the person, maybe throw away the ugly parts and celebrate them even after they're gone."}, {"time": 663, "text": "So that's a really interesting opportunity."}, {"time": 665, "text": "You've also mentioned to me offline that you're really excited about all the different wearables and all the different ways we can collect information about our bodies, about the whole thing."}, {"time": 678, "text": "What's most exciting to you in terms of collecting the biological data about a human being?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "Well, so I'm a biologist."}, {"time": 689, "text": "I find animals and humans as machines very interesting."}, {"time": 694, "text": "It's one of the reasons I didn't become an engineer or a surgeon."}, {"time": 697, "text": "I wanted to understand how we actually are built."}, {"time": 700, "text": "And so I think a lot about machines merging with humans."}, {"time": 706, "text": "And the first of that are the bio wearables."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And so I talked a lot about this, I wrote about it in Lifespan, the book, and pictured a future where you would be monitored constantly so that you wouldn't suddenly have a heart attack, you'd know that was coming, or you wouldn't go to the doctor and they don't know if you need an antibiotic or not."}, {"time": 727, "text": "Long term, how old are you, how to fix things, what should you eat, what should you take, what should your doctor do?"}, {"time": 732, "text": "These devices, I predicted, would be smarter, better educated than your physician and would augment them."}, {"time": 739, "text": "And then there'd be a human that would just tick off to see if it's correct and they approve."}, {"time": 744, "text": "I also was predicting in the book that we would have video conferences with our doctors and that medicines would be delivered, initially by courier, but eventually by drones and get it to you sometimes in an emergency."}, {"time": 756, "text": "And that we could even have pills that were synthesized or delivered in your kitchen and combined certainly."}, {"time": 763, "text": "What's amazing about that is that, what are we now, two years since the book came out, even less, and that future is basically here already."}, {"time": 772, "text": "COVID 19 accelerated that incredibly."}, {"time": 776, "text": "So where we're at now in society is, if you wanna pay for it, you can have a blood test that will detect cancer 10, 20 years earlier than it would before it forms a tumor."}, {"time": 785, "text": "You can, of course, do your genome very cheaply for less than $100 now."}, {"time": 790, "text": "There are bio wearables already I wear, this ring from Aura that I have a number of years of data."}, {"time": 797, "text": "I've been doing blood tests for the last 12 years with a company called Inside Tracker, which I consult for."}, {"time": 802, "text": "And so I have all of that data as well."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And there's 34 different parameters on my testosterone, my blood glucose, my inflammation."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And I use all that data to, of course, I wear a watch that measures things as well."}, {"time": 814, "text": "I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So I'm now 51."}, {"time": 820, "text": "And according to those parameters, I'm at least as good as someone in their early 40s."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And if I really work at it, I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid 30s, though I like to now eat a little dessert once in a while."}, {"time": 836, "text": "So that's the future we're in right now."}, {"time": 838, "text": "Anyone can do what I just said."}, {"time": 840, "text": "But in the very near future, just in the next few years, you can be wearing wearables."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So I'm currently wearing a little, what's called a bio sticker."}, {"time": 850, "text": "This one I just put on last night."}, {"time": 854, "text": "It's about an inch long, a few millimeters."}, {"time": 858, "text": "Yeah, for people just listening, it's on David's chest."}, {"time": 861, "text": "It's just, how does it attach?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's just kind of."}, {"time": 864, "text": "It sticks on."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Sticks on."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Yeah, so on one side you have an on button that you press."}, {"time": 867, "text": "The lights come on, flashes four times, it's good to go."}, {"time": 870, "text": "It immediately syncs to your phone."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And this one, it's called a bio button, a nice name."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And there's another one that I have that I haven't tried yet that does EKG on your heart."}, {"time": 881, "text": "This is mainly for doctors to monitor patients that go home after a heart attack or surgery."}, {"time": 885, "text": "But that's medical grade FDA approved device."}, {"time": 888, "text": "So there will be a day, in fact, it's already here, that doctors are using these to get patients to go home and save a week in hospital, $2,000 at least for each patient."}, {"time": 900, "text": "That's massive savings for the hospital."}, {"time": 904, "text": "But ultimately what I'm excited about is a future that isn't that far off where everybody, certainly in developed countries, eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable."}, {"time": 914, "text": "The only cost will be the software subscription that can be monitored constantly."}, {"time": 919, "text": "And to give an idea what this is measuring me at a thousand times a second is my vibrations as I speak, my orientation, it already has told me this morning how I slept, where I slept, what side I slept on."}, {"time": 933, "text": "We've got sneezing, coughing, body temperature, heart rate, heart of other parameters of the heart that would indicate heart health."}, {"time": 944, "text": "These data are being used to now to predict sickness."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So eventually we'll have just in the next year or so the ability to predict whether something or diagnose whether something is pneumonia or just a rhinovirus that can be treated or not."}, {"time": 962, "text": "This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine, but I think extend lives dramatically."}, {"time": 968, "text": "Because if I'm gonna have a heart attack next week and that's possible, this device should know that and I'll be in hospital before I even have it."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Maybe you can talk a little bit about InsideTracker because I saw that there's some really cool things in there."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Like it actually, so maybe you can talk about, I guess that you're collecting blood to give it the data."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So, and it has like basic recommendations on how to improve your life."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So we're not just talking about diseases, right?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "Like anticipating having a particular disease, but it's almost like guiding your trajectory to life, how to, whether it's extend your life or just live a more fulfilling, like improve the quality of life."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "I suppose this is the right way to say it."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "How does InsideTracker work?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "What the heck is it?"}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Because I thought there was also pretty cool."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "Is it something other people can use?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "You can definitely use it."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "You can sign up, it's consumer."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "It's like a company consumer facing company."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And I also want to democratize the ability to just take a mouth swab eventually."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "We don't need to have a blood test necessarily, but for now it's a blood test and you'd go to a lab core request in the US."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It's also available overseas."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "You can upload your own data for a minimal cost and get the algorithms, the AI in the background to take that data, plot where you are against others in your age group in terms of health and longevity at bio age."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "They call it inner age, but also it provides recommendations."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And this isn't just a bunch of BS."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "It sounds like it might be to say, I'll go eat this or go to that restaurant and order that, but it's actually based on the basic."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "This company has entered hundreds."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Now it would be thousands of scientific papers into their database and hundreds of thousands of human data points."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And they have tens of thousands of individuals that have been tracked over time and anonymously that data is used to say what works and what doesn't."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "If you eat that, what works?"}, {"time": 1085, "text": "If you take that supplement, what works?"}, {"time": 1087, "text": "And I was a coauthor on a paper that showed that the recommendations for food and supplements was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "The idea that you can connect, like skipping the human having to do this work, you can connect the scientific papers, almost like meta analysis of the science connected to the individual data."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And then based on that sort of connect your data to whatever the proper group is within the whatever the scientific paper is to make the suggestion of how like how that work applies to your life."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation of what you should do with your life."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Like it all like this giant system that ultimately recommends you should drink more coffee or less."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Right, and we'll have the genome in there as well."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "You can upload that."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Yeah, it's awesome."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So these programs will know us way better than we do and our doctors as well."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "The idea of going to a doctor once a year for an annual checkup and having males get a finger up their butt and you cough, that to me is a joke."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "That's medieval medicine."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "And that's very soon going to be seen as medieval."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Yeah, to me as a computer science person, it's always upsetting to go to the doctor and just look at him and like realize you know nothing about me."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Like you're making your like opinions based on like, it is very valuable, years of intuition building about basic symptoms, but you're just like it is medieval."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "They're very good at it."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "In fact, doctors in medieval times were probably damn good at working with very little."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "But the thing is, I'd rather prefer a doctor that doesn't really know what they're doing, but has a huge amount of data to work with."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "And many of my good friends are doctors."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I work at Harvard."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So I'm not against the profession at all."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "But I think that they need just as much help as anyone else does."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "We wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "We wouldn't think of it."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "So why would doctors do the same?"}, {"time": 1218, "text": "If we could, could we step back to the big, profound, philosophical, both tragic and beautiful question about age?"}, {"time": 1226, "text": "How and why do we age?"}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Is it from an engineering perspective?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "You said you like the biological machine."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Is that a feature or a bug of the biological machine?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It is both a bug and a feature."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Evolutionary speaking, we only live as long as we need to to replace ourselves efficiently."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "If you're a mouse, you're only gonna live two and a half years, three years."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "You're probably gonna die of starvation, predation, freezing in the winter."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So they divert most of their resources to reproducing rapidly, but they don't put a lot of energy into preserving their soma, which is their body."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Conversely, a baleen type of whale, a bowhead whale in particular will live hundreds of years because they're at the top of the food chain and they can live as long as they want."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So they breed slowly and build a body that lasts."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "We're somewhere in between because we've, you know, we've really only just come out of the savannas where we could be picked off by a cat."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "We were pretty wimpy going back 6 million years ago."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "So we actually need to evolve quicker than evolution will."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And that's why we can use our oversized brains and intuition to give us what evolution not only didn't give us, but took away from us."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "Now we're pathetic, look at our bodies."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "These arms, if any of us, even the strongest person in the world went in a cage with a chimpanzee, the chimp could knock that person's head off, no question."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So we're pathetic."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So we need to engineer ourselves to be healthier and longer lived."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So getting to aging, we can do better, right?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Whales do way better."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "We're trying to learn how whales do that."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And if you ask really anybody in the field now, professor, they'll say there are eight or nine hallmarks of aging, which are really, it's a word for causes of aging."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "So that you probably have heard of some of these, your listeners will have loss of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes, like the little ends of shoelaces, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "They get too short, cells stop dividing, become senescent."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "They become, they put out what are called mitogens that cause cancer and inflammatory molecules."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So that's another aspect of aging, cellular senescence."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Another one is loss of the energetic."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So mitochondria, the battery packs wind down."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "There's a whole bunch, stem cells, proteostasis."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "Well, these are our Achilles heels that I'm talking about."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "They're a common amongst all life forms, really."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "But if you want me to jump to the chases to where, what is the upstream defining factor?"}, {"time": 1374, "text": "If we boil it down, what do we get?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So most biologists would say, you can't boil it down."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "It's too complex."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "I would say you can boil it down to an equation, which is the preservation of information and loss due to entropy, i.e."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "noise."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And that is the basis of my research."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "It originally came out of discoveries in yeast cells, where I went to MIT in the 1990s."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "You studied bread."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "I kind of did."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "I studied the makers of bread, a little yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which at the time was one of the hottest, excuse the pun, organisms to work on."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "But we figured out in the lab why yeast cells get old and found genes that control that process and made them live longer, which was an amazing four years of my life."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "One of those genes had a name with an acronym SIR2."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Now the two is irrelevant."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "The SIR is important."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "And the most important letter out of all of those three is I, which stands for information."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Silent information regulator number two, when you put more copies of that gene in, just put in one more copy, the yeast cells lived 30% longer and suppressed the cause of aging, which was the dysregulation of information in the cell."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And then, so fast forward to now, I've been looking in humans and mice, because they live shorter and cheaper to study, where the loss of information in our bodies is a root cause of aging."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And I think it is."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Your boldness in doing biology in this way is fascinating because that also leads to a kind of, it's almost like allows for a theory of aging, like you could boil it down to a single equation and it leads to a, perhaps a metric that allows you to optimize aging, sort of in the fight against entropy."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I had to figure out which mechanisms, like you said, the silent information regulator, which mechanisms allow you to preserve information without injecting noise, without creating entropy, without creating degradation of that information."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "For some reason, converting biology, which I thought was mostly impossible into an engineering problem, feels like it makes it amenable to optimization, to solving problems, to creating technology that can, whether that's genetic engineering or AI, it makes it possible to create the technology that would improve the degradation of information and aging."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Is there more concrete ways you think about the kind of information you want to preserve?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And also, is there good ideas about regulators of that information, about ways to prevent the distortion, the degradation of that information?"}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Right, so we have silent information regulator genes in our bodies."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "We have seven of them, SIRT1 through seven, they're called."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And we found in mice, one way to slow down the loss of information is to just give more of these, to upregulate these genes."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "So we made a mouse that has more of this SIRT1 gene, turned it on, and that slowed down the aging of the brain and preserved their information."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "Now, what information am I talking about, you might ask?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Well, again, you can simplify biology."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "There are two types of information in the cell primarily."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "The one we all read about and know about is the DNA, the genome."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And that's base four information, ATCG, the four chemicals that make up the various sequences of the genome, billions of letters."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And that also degrades over time."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "But what's been fascinating is that we find that that information is pretty much intact in old animals and people."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "You can clone a dog."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "One of my friends in LA just cloned his dog three times."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So this is doable, right?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "It means that the genome can be intact."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "But what's the other type of information?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "It's the epigenome, the regulators of the genetic information."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And physically, that's really just how the DNA is wrapped up or looped out for the cell to access it and read it."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So it's similar to, and excuse this analogy, but it's a good one, a compact disc or a DVD."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "Those pits in the foil are the digital information."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "That's the genome."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And the epigenome is the reader of that information."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And in a different cell, you'd read different music, different songs, different symphonies."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And that's what gets laid down when we're in the womb."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "And that makes a

asking almost like an anecdotal question or unless you know the science."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "Well, the science is still being worked out, but from the synthesis of everything that I've read, I

"Same with wine, you typically want them to be dry before you harvest or covered in fungus."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "And that's because these plants make these colorful and xenohormetic molecules

"That's the idea and we've evolved to do so."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "This isn't a coincidence."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "It's my theory, our theory that we want to know when our food supply is under adversity because we need to get ready for a famine."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And so we hunker down and preserve our body and by eating these colored foods, so practically speaking, if it's full of color or if there's been some chewing by a caterpillar, organic, grown locally in local farms, I'll eat that versus a watery, insipid, light colored lettuce that's been grown in California."},

asymptotic curve."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "And in fact, if you overdo it, you probably have reduced benefits, particularly if you start to wear out joints, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3923,

the kind of exercise that I like to do, aerobic."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Though I do enjoy lifting weights, so that is what I call my exercise, which has other benefits, including maintaining

to brown noise when I work."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "And the first time I listened to it, something happened to my mind where it just went like zoomed in to like, in a way that it felt like really weird."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "Like how precisely it was able to sort of remove the distractions of the world and really help my mind."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "Obviously, like the mind is trying

should definitely try it if you're listening to this."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Maybe it's just my own mind, but it's funny, like it made me, brown noise made me realize that there's probably hacks

neuroscience perspective, the human mind, but do you have hope for it increasing longevity in terms of how it's used?"}, {"time": 5378, "text": "I think that it can help with certain diseases."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "But I see, at least within our lifetime, that's the best use of it is to be able to replace parts of the body that are not functioning, such as the retina and other parts, the visual cortex back here."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "That's going to be doable."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "In terms of longevity, maybe we could put something on the hypothalamus and start secreting those hormones and get that back."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "Ultimately, I think the best way to preserve the brain is going to be to record it."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "But also, I think it's going to require death, unfortunately, to then do very detailed scans, even if you have enough time and money, atomic microscopy, and rebuild the brain from scratch."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "Rebuild from scratch, yeah."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "We are living more and more in a digital world."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "I wonder if the scanning is good enough for the critical things in terms of memories, in terms of the particular quirks of your cognitive processes."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "They're not, they're not, yeah."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "We're not close, yes, but we've made quite a bit of progress, so if you're an exponential type of person."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "Yeah, well, let's dream a little here."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "Yes, that's the point."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "The way it would work, that I could see it working is, so you take a single cell slice through your dead brain, and we can now, the problem with the engineering aspect is that, the engineering is, the physical aspect of the brain is not even half the problem."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "The problem is which genes are switched on and off."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "So you can say, okay, this nerve cell, had these genes switched on and these switched off, we can recreate that, but just scanning the brain and looking how the nerves are touching each other is not gonna do it."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So you have to scan the full biology, the full details."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "And look at the epigenome."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "And the epigenome too."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Yeah, which genes are on and off."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "It's just easier to reset the epigenome and get them to work like they used to."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "We're doing that now."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "Use the hardware we already have, just figure out how to make that hardware last longer."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "Right, ultimately information will be lost, even genetic information degrades slowly through mutation."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So immortality is not achievable through that means, though I think we could potentially reset the body hundreds of times and live for thousands of years."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "Okay, so we talked about biology."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "Let's, forgive me, but let's talk about philosophy for just a brief moment."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "So somebody I've enjoyed reading, Ernest Becker wrote The Denial of Death."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "There's also Martin Heidegger."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "There's a bunch of philosophers who claim that most people live life in denial of death."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "Sort of we don't fully internalize the idea that we're going to die."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "Because if we did, as they say, there will be a kind of terror of, I mean a deep fear of death."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "The fact that we don't know what's, like we almost don't know what to do with non existence, with disappearing."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "Like our, the way we draw meaning from life seems to be grounded in the fact that we exist and that we at some point will not exist is terrifying."}, {"time": 5614, "text": "And so we live in an illusion that we're not going to die and we run from that terror."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "That's what Ernest Becker would say."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "Do you think there's any truth to that?"}, {"time": 5624, "text": "Oh, I know there's truth to that."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "I experience it every day when I talk to people."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "We have to live that way."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "Although unfortunately I can't, but for most people it's extremely distressing to think about their own mortality."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "We think about it occasionally."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "And if we really thought about it every day, we'd probably be brought to tears."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "How much we not just miss ourselves, but miss our family, our friends."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "All living life forms have evolved to not want to die."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And when I mean want, biochemically, genetically, physically."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "That yeast cell, the cells that I studied at MIT, they were fighting for their lives."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "They didn't think, but our brain has evolved the same survival aspect."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Of course, we don't want to die."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "But the problem for us, unfortunately, it's a curse and a blessing is that we're now conscious."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "We know that we're going to die."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Most species that have ever existed don't."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "That's a burden, that's a curse."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "And so what I think has happened is we've evolved certainly to want to live for a long time, perhaps never want to die."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "But the thought about dying is so traumatic that there is an innate part of our brains."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "And it's probably genetically wired to not think about it."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "I really think that's part of being human."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Because, think about tribes that obsessed with longevity every day and that we're going to die."}, {"time": 5709,

to naturally deny aging."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "And it's one of the problems that I face in my career."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "And when I speak publicly and on social media is that it's

very, what you call the curse, which I agree with you, it's a curse and a blessing that we're able to contemplate our own mortality."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "That gives meaning to life."}, {"time":
