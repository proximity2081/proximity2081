you've experienced that you're mortal."}, {"time": 288, "text": "Yeah, that, yeah."}, {"time": 289, "text": "And I'll say mortal and what you're looking at here physically, I won't say my soul is mortal."}, {"time": 298, "text": "I'll say it's immortal because at the end of the day, it's just like I can sit here and I could just hum, please, please, please, by James Brown."}, {"time": 310, "text": "But James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that."}, {"time": 316, "text": "So in some sense, James Brown is still here."}, {"time": 318, "text": "In another sense, he's gone."}, {"time": 319, "text": "His soul is here."}, {"time": 322, "text": "Well, it lives through you by you singing it."}, {"time": 325, "text": "It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it."}, {"time": 328, "text": "And the hope is that the human species continues to celebrate the great minds and the great creations of the past."}, {"time": 336, "text": "I will add this to that equation."}, {"time": 341, "text": "When I say it's immortal, I don't think it's not just only because somebody sings it, right?"}, {"time": 348, "text": "It's like, where's the fire at right now?"}, {"time": 352, "text": "It's in the air."}, {"time": 354, "text": "You just gotta spark the spark."}, {"time": 358, "text": "So it's always there."}, {"time": 363, "text": "Nah, I'm not afraid of death."}, {"time": 365, "text": "I'm not trying to see it."}, {"time": 368, "text": "I'm not watching that nowhere near me, right?"}, {"time": 370, "text": "Because all I know is life, right?"}, {"time": 372, "text": "My life is living."}, {"time": 375, "text": "I read a lot of ancient texts, people probably know about me."}, {"time": 379, "text": "I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma."}, {"time": 381, "text": "And there was a thing written in one of the books of his or one of the teachings of his."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And the question, somebody asked him similar question, you're scared of death or what are you gonna be after you die?"}, {"time": 399, "text": "And his answer was, I don't know."}, {"time": 401, "text": "He had answers to everything."}, {"time": 403, "text": "But he was like, I don't know."}, {"time": 404, "text": "They said, oh, he doesn't know that."}, {"time": 406, "text": "So yeah, because I haven't died yet."}, {"time": 408, "text": "Yeah, well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying."}, {"time": 412, "text": "Not knowing what's on the other side of the door."}, {"time": 416, "text": "I mean, especially when you're young."}, {"time": 418, "text": "You know, as a kid, fear permeated my life."}, {"time": 424, "text": "You know, I was actually watching horror movies and I believed in all type of supernatural things that could or can happen."}, {"time": 432, "text": "I thought I saw things as well."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And you know, whether it was being projected in my own mind or whether it was there

"text": "On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you, when it rains, get wet."}, {"time": 471, "text": "What do these words mean to you?"}, {"time": 474, "text": "Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was, you know, I think I was more conservative, like as a person."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And like, you know, I had money."}, {"time": 487, "text": "Women wanted me."}, {"time": 489, "text": "Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had."}, {"time": 495, "text": "And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet."}, {"time": 497, "text": "Enjoy this, man."}, {"time": 498, "text": "It's raining on you."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Don't put up the umbrella."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Don't go back in the house."}, {"time": 504, "text": "Get wet."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Experience the moment."}, {"time": 507, "text": "Yeah, and enjoy it."}, {"time": 508, "text": "And I didn't take total heed to him at that time."}, {"time": 512, "text": "A couple of years later, I took some heed."}, {"time": 515, "text": "But at that time, I didn't take heed."}, {"time": 516, "text": "And when I took heed, I think that I may have misinterpreted by looking at his example of getting wet versus my example of getting wet."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And I can tell you right now, I'm getting wet right now in my way."}, {"time": 536, "text": "In part, thanks to your mother."}, {"time": 537, "text": "But overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain, just like the experience of every moment."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Yeah, and I'll share this with you because this is going to be a very open conversation and I haven't had this conversation."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So definitely in part to my mother, then in part to my wife."}, {"time": 555, "text": "I meet my wife, it's my second wife, but I met her after my mother passed."}, {"time": 562, "text": "And she was just a friend."}, {"time": 563, "text": "You know, some girl I met, I thought she was beautiful and actually built a friendship with her."}, {"time": 571, "text": "But a few years later, when the relationship became like, you know, this is going to be my woman, it was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce and I was like, you know, do I run wild and hey, hey, hey, you know, me and my wife already filed, we were separated."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And do I run wild?"}, {"time": 591, "text": "And I didn't run wild, a little bit, but not too wild."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And you know, I'm still a man, I'm a hip hop guy, so."}, {"time": 600, "text": "I read you know how to party."}, {"time": 602, "text": "But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Talani, my uncle said, she reminds me of your mother."}, {"time": 615, "text": "He knew my mother before I knew my mother."}, {"time": 618, "text": "And he saw that and we ended up dating, got engaged and then her mother passes."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And so now there's a total understanding of everything."}, {"time": 635, "text": "And we actually help build each other back up."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness."}, {"time": 643, "text": "Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness to actual actualization, like to actually feel, I don't think I'll be talking to you right now and talking as much as I do these days, if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony that I was able to gain at home, you know, so."}, {"time": 665, "text": "And like you said, you now share that look of having both lost your, your mom."}, {"time": 673, "text": "What have you learned from Quincy about music, about business, about life?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "Quincy Jones is a great mind, great artist, you know, a treasure in all reality."}, {"time": 687, "text": "He seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this, he couldn't eat in the same places he played his music at to owning places bigger than ours."}, {"time": 696, "text": "So what a beautiful life, you know?"}, {"time": 701, "text": "He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him, you got a lifetime of information."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him and days with him."}, {"time": 711, "text": "And, you know, there's a certain period of time where we came across each other and he was always there to share the knowledge."}, {"time": 719, "text": "Like that's another thing about him that I think is special."}, {"time": 721, "text": "And hopefully I picked that up, is that he's always willing to share, share with his experience, his knowledge."}, {"time": 732, "text": "I mean, I think he'll even share his home to the right person if he feels that that's what they need to get back on their feet."}, {"time": 740, "text": "He's a very beautiful man."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So just the kindness, the goodness of the man is like the thing that really rubbed off on you."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties, as a producer, produced one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the greatest selling albums of all time."}, {"time": 762, "text": "Not just great critically, economically great."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now."}, {"time": 769, "text": "So I might have a great year coming up."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Time and well, yeah."}, {"time": 777, "text": "So now you got a taste of what greatness is."}, {"time": 780, "text": "You get to see what greatness is."}, {"time": 781, "text": "So you know what you need to do for yourself."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Exactly, how to strive for yourself, yeah."}, {"time": 786, "text": "You have a few people you've worked with who are fascinating like yourself."}, {"time": 790, "text": "Quentin Tarantino, you worked with him."}, {"time": 794, "text": "When somebody asked you to describe him with one word, you said encyclopedia."}, {"time": 798, "text": "What have you learned from the guy about filmmaking and about life again?"}, {"time": 802, "text": "A very generous man with his knowledge."}, {"time": 805, "text": "And for me, he shared it, I think, in a way that was unique in a sense of, you know, at a point in time, you know, we just was super duper tight."}, {"time": 815, "text": "Like, you know, like I'm going to this crib and watching movies and just having long conversations about art and about life."}, {"time": 828, "text": "I consider him, you know, especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life, I consider him the godfather of that for me."}, {"time": 836, "text": "I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me, which is a very humbling thing to do coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am, coming from, I was already a multi platinum artist, you know, I mean, it was a year, it was past the year 2000 already."}, {"time": 856, "text": "So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me."}, {"time": 860, "text": "So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "But I humbled myself because I saw in him a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me, but I was just a Patamon at it, I was a novice at it because I was trying to make movies in my music, you know, trying to make videos."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And here was a man who was a master of it and an encyclopedia of it as well."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Like film history."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Film history from whether it's the actor, the director, the cinematographer, maybe even the costume designer."}, {"time": 898, "text": "He may know 50, 60, he may know the 50 greatest costume designers in his memory."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's a guy's brain."}, {"time": 906, "text": "Both of you have pretty good memory."}, {"time": 909, "text": "I'd love to be a fly on the wall of that conversation."}, {"time": 912, "text": "And kung fu movies, most of you guys want."}, {"time": 914, "text": "We actually started, I think we started our relationship trying to outdo each other."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Knowledge wise or what?"}, {"time": 922, "text": "Yeah, movie knowledge wise."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Actually kung fu movie knowledge wise."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And I think that, if it wasn't another category, I wouldn't have had a chance, but at least in that category, I was pretty holding my weight."}, {"time": 935, "text": "For one."}, {"time": 937, "text": "I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few, he didn't see, but Quentin is older than me."}, {"time": 945, "text": "So he could go back."}, {"time": 947, "text": "Farther."}, {"time": 948, "text": "Yeah, he could go back to 72 when I didn't see one yet."}, {"time": 953, "text": "Well, he said Master of the Flying Gate Team that I got a chance to, that you commentated over today and I got a chance to see the screening of."}, {"time": 960, "text": "He said that's one of his favorites."}, {"time": 963, "text": "For you, the 36 Chamber of Shaolin, the Master Killer is your favorite."}, {"time": 970, "text": "Best ever, would you say?"}, {"time": 971, "text": "That's the greatest Kung Fu movie ever?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?"}, {"time": 978, "text": "Because somebody may make another one and it depends on your own phase of life."}, {"time": 982, "text": "But I will put that first."}, {"time": 988, "text": "If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies, that's a beautiful entry."}, {"time": 992, "text": "You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom."}, {"time": 995, "text": "What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "The, you know what?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "The martial art itself and the movies."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?"}, {"time": 1007, "text": "I draw it in a way, you know, that I could decipher it in my own life."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "So for instance, in the movie, Master Killer, he basically, when he does Kung Fu, he does it really a style called the Hung Ga technique."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And the director of the movie is actually a Hung Ga expert who has a lineage that traces all the way back to Shaolin Temple."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure and to bring Hung Ga to the world."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine is Quentin's favorite movie."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And we mentioned that 36 Chambers is my favorite movie, but the action director of Master of Flying Guillotine is the director of 36 Chambers of Shaolin."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "And some of the things that's happening in Master of the Flying Guillotine is really the infant stage of what this action director is going to learn and then use later on in his movies."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So that's the beauty of it."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "It's almost like, you know, Quentin is seeing him in his generation."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So Quentin might have been the same age I was watching that movie."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And then when he becomes a director, I'm at Quentin's age and now I'm seeing his work."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So some symbionic relationship there."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And I'll end this question by saying, Hung Ga deals with the five animal technique, the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake, and a dragon."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Those are the five, that's the five pattern."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Some people go seven, some go 12, but it's a stick to the five pattern fist."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "How do a man emulate a tiger?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And you see a tiger's fists."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "He curls before he spawns on you."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "How does a man emulate a snake?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "It doesn't have to be only in the Kung Fu move."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "It's in the ideology of the snake."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "It's in the agility of the crane."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "At any moment, sometimes punching a person is not going to work, as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So sometimes you might have to poke them in the eye with the crane's beak."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So having your mind able to adapt the instinct of the animal when you are being attacked or when you are being the aggressor, that's something that you don't need a form for."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "That's the mentality."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "So Kung Fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly because at first I was trying to learn how to hold my, like, I can't really hit you with that and really hurt you unless I've been banging my hand a thousand times on some bricks and made it so callous or muscles are so strong."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight and I'm going to tiger up on you and take that instinct and prance when I'm a prance, or fly away like the stork, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "Like, yo, that's the mentality."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "It's much more than the technical moves."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "It's much deeper."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "I mean, when I see the Kung Fu movies, because I love martial arts, all martial arts, and competitive ones too, like the actual competitions and so on."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It just seems like Kung Fu movies go much deeper than just like the techniques."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Yeah, they start, I mean, if you see it, right, even I watched the great MMA fight recently, just interesting because he was on top of the guy, and the way he got from under him, it had to be his spirit got from under him."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It's some like mixture of crane and whatever."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "No, I love that when people become artists in the cage or that's much bigger than just like winning, much bigger than particular techniques."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "It's just art, especially at the highest level competition where millions of people are watching."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Which is pressure within itself."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Yeah, that's art under pressure is even more beautiful art."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "You know, you look at some of these fights and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And sometimes the less talent guy could win because he could deal with the pressure."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "But the other guy, he could have beat them if they were somewhere else, but not in this arena."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "I've listened to so many of your interviews."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "What made them special in the history of music?"}, {"time": 1309, "text": "Mm, that's a good question."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it, but I'll just speak my piece on it."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And maybe I could just add on."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Cause I'm sure it's a lot of people that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "But just as a fellow artist, I think not only was B.I.G a dope lyricist, I think he had a voice that was really immaculate."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "In a sense that some rappers get on top of music and you gotta get used to them when you gotta vibe with them."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "But he make a record sounds like a record immediately."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "If you go back and listen to his music, you could take his voice and put it on anything."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And for some reason, it sounds like a record."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "You mean just like the raw voice of the man?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So you could just listen to it raw and it sounds like a record."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Yeah, but if you put a beat, take his voice and put it on any beat, he just has a voice, it's immaculate, you know?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So his lyrical skills and all that was great."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And you gotta think once again, he's doing all this, he's not even 25 years old."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "And then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But what Pac had, I think, was a way of touching us on all of our emotions."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And especially on, like Pac had the power to infuse your emotional thought."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Like Brenda has a baby, their mama."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And those two things, actually, he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "To this day, we are still, but Pac was probably going to a point, he was more going into the Malcolm X of things and society fears that."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love and at starting revolutions."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And that's dangerous."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "Very dangerous."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And they communicated love, but he wasn't starting revolutions."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Well, it's interesting to think about what the world would be like if they were still with us."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "But it's the way of the world."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Yeah, it's a peculiar thing."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?"}, {"time": 1487, "text": "And I answered, you know, I'm not scared of death."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "I'm not trying to see it, though."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "It's like, that was the block of death."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "It's like, I'm not really going right there right now."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "I'm making a left or right turn."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "It's like, okay, I got to drive through that."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Yeah, but it can still happen."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "That's the meditation on death part, where you could die at the end of today."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Yeah, you could die."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Well, dying and death, I think, is two different things, personally."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "The process you mean of death or just?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Yeah, I mean, you could die."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "Like I said, you could die every day."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "You could die and not be yourself."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Which is crazy."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "But to get to a point of no return, you know, that's a whole nother chamber."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "I mean, there's some sense in which RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely when you're making a film, becomes somebody else completely when you're, I don't know, playing chess, becomes completely something different when you do kung fu or watch kung fu or when you're a family man."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "All of those are little deaths when you transition from one place to another."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "So it's not like you're one being."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "You're many things."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "I would describe, now I would describe that as all life, dawg."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Yeah, it's fun."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang, who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics, like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Let's name a few."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "I mean, you're gonna have to start with Rakim."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "You're gonna have to pick Coogee Rap in there."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So going back."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "Yeah, you're gonna have to pick up with those brothers first."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "You might have to, if you want to get, technically you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Who you might not even heard
