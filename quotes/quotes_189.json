But sorry to pause on that."}, {"time": 359, "text": "Martial arts?"}, {"time": 359, "text": "You have a long list of hobbies."}, {"time": 363, "text": "Like it scrolls off the page, but I didn't see martial arts as one of them."}, {"time": 367, "text": "I do not do martial arts, but I certainly watch martial arts."}, {"time": 370, "text": "Oh, I appreciate it very much."}, {"time": 370, "text": "Oh, we could talk about every Jackie Chan movie ever made, and I would be on board with that."}, {"time": 375, "text": "The Shower, too?"}, {"time": 375, "text": "Like that kind of comedy of a cop?"}, {"time": 378, "text": "By the way, my favorite Jackie Chan movie would be Drunken Master 2, known in the States usually as Legend of the Drunken Master."}, {"time": 389, "text": "Actually, Drunken Master, the first one, is the first kung fu movie I ever saw, but I did not know that."}, {"time": 394, "text": "First Jackie Chan movie?"}, {"time": 396, "text": "No, first one ever that I saw and remember, but I had no idea that that's what it was, and I didn't know that was Jackie Chan."}, {"time": 400, "text": "That was like his first major movie."}, {"time": 403, "text": "I was a kid."}, {"time": 403, "text": "It was done in the 70s."}, {"time": 406, "text": "I only later rediscovered that that was actually."}, {"time": 409, "text": "And he creates his own martial art by drinking."}, {"time": 409, "text": "Was he actually drinking or was he played drinking?"}, {"time": 418, "text": "You mean as an actor or as a character?"}, {"time": 419, "text": "I'm sure as an actor."}, {"time": 419, "text": "He was in the 70s or whatever."}, {"time": 424, "text": "He was definitely drinking, and in the end, he drinks industrial grade alcohol."}, {"time": 430, "text": "Yeah, and has one of the most fantastic fights ever in that subgenre."}, {"time": 435, "text": "Anyway, that's my favorite one of his movies, but I'll tell you the last movie."}, {"time": 439, "text": "It's actually a movie called Nothing But a Man, which is the 1960s, starred Ivan Dixon, who you'll know from Hogan's Heroes, and Abby Lincoln."}, {"time": 451, "text": "It's just a really small little drama."}, {"time": 451, "text": "It's a beautiful story."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But my favorite scenes, I'm cheating, one of my favorite movies just for the ending is The Godfather."}, {"time": 461, "text": "I think the last scene of that is just fantastic."}, {"time": 461, "text": "It's the whole movie all summarized in just eight, nine seconds."}, {"time": 468, "text": "Godfather Part One?"}, {"time": 469, "text": "Part One."}, {"time": 470, "text": "How does it end?"}, {"time": 470, "text": "I don't think you need to worry about spoilers if you haven't seen The Godfather."}, {"time": 474, "text": "It ends with the wife coming to Michael, and he says, just this once, I'll let you ask me my business."}, {"time": 481, "text": "And she asks him if he did this terrible thing, and he looks her in the eye and he lies, and he says, no."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And she says, thank you."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And she walks out the door, and you see her going out of the door, and all these people are coming in, and they're kissing Michael's hands, and Godfather."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And then the camera switches perspective."}, {"time": 504, "text": "So instead of looking at him, you're looking at her, and the door closes in her face, and that's the end of the movie."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And that's the whole movie right there."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Do you see parallels between that and your position as Dean at Georgia Tech Chrome?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "Trick question."}, {"time": 519, "text": "Sometimes, certainly."}, {"time": 519, "text": "The door gets closed on me every once in a while."}, {"time": 524, "text": "That was a rhetorical question."}, {"time": 524, "text": "You've also mentioned that you, I think, enjoy all kinds of experiments, including on yourself."}, {"time": 531, "text": "But I saw a video where you said you did an experiment where you tracked all kinds of information about yourself and a few others sort of wiring up your home."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And this little idea that you mentioned in that video, which is kind of interesting, that you thought that two days worth of data is enough to capture majority of the behavior of the human being."}, {"time": 556, "text": "First, can you describe what the heck you did to collect all the data?"}, {"time": 556, "text": "Because it's fascinating, just like little details of how you collect that data and also what your intuition behind the two days is."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So first off, it has to be the right two days."}, {"time": 568, "text": "But I was thinking of a very specific experiment."}, {"time": 572, "text": "There's actually a suite of them that I've been a part of, and other people have done this, of course."}, {"time": 576, "text": "I just sort of dabbled in that part of the world."}, {"time": 576, "text": "But to be very clear, the specific thing that I was talking about had to do with recording all the IR going on in my infrared going on in my house."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So this is a long time ago."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So this is everything's being curled by pressing buttons on remote controls, as opposed to speaking to Alexa or Siri or someone like that."}, {"time": 596, "text": "And I was just trying to figure out if you could get enough data on people to figure out what they were going to do with their TVs or their lights."}, {"time": 601, "text": "My house was completely wired up at the time."}, {"time": 606, "text": "But you know, what I'm about to look at a movie, I'm about to turn on the TV or whatever and just see what I could predict from it."}, {"time": 610, "text": "It was kind of surprising."}, {"time": 610, "text": "It shouldn't have been."}, {"time": 610, "text": "But that's all very easy to do, by the way, just capturing all the little stuff."}, {"time": 616, "text": "I mean, it's a bunch of computers systems."}, {"time": 619, "text": "It's really easy to capture today if you know what you're looking for."}, {"time": 619, "text": "At Georgia Tech, long before I got there, we had this thing called the Aware Home, where everything was wired up and you captured everything that was going on."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Nothing even difficult, not with video or anything like that, just the way that the system was just capturing everything."}, {"time": 631, "text": "So it turns out that, and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked with many other people."}, {"time": 637, "text": "And it turns out at the end of the day, people do the same things over and over and over again."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So it has to be the right two days, like a weekend."}, {"time": 647, "text": "But it turns out not only can you predict what someone's going to do next at the level of what button they're going to press next on a remote control, but you can do it with something really, really simple."}, {"time": 655, "text": "You don't even need a hidden mark off model."}, {"time": 661, "text": "It's like a mark, just simply, I press this, this is my prediction of the next thing."}, {"time": 665, "text": "It turns out you can get 93% accuracy just by doing something very simple and stupid and just counting statistics."}, {"time": 671, "text": "But what was actually more interesting is that you could use that information."}, {"time": 675, "text": "This comes up again and again in my work."}, {"time": 675, "text": "If you try to represent people or objects by the things they do, the things you can measure about them that have to do with action in the world."}, {"time": 681, "text": "So distribution over actions, and you try to represent them by the distribution of actions that are done on them, then you do a pretty good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster remarkably well, in fact, irritatingly so."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And so by clustering people this way, you can maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy of what's the next button you're going to press, but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere there's about on the collections of things you might press."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other and exactly what you would expect."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So for example, all the key, all the numbers on a keypad, it turns out all have the same behavior with respect to you as a human being."}, {"time": 724, "text": "And so you would naturally cluster them together and you discover that numbers are all related to one another in some way and all these other things."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And then, and here's the part that I think is important."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I mean, you can see this in all kinds of things."}, {"time": 738, "text": "Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably predictable because you keep doing the same things over and over again."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And the two things that I've learned in the long time that I've been thinking about this is people are easily predictable and people hate when you tell them that they're easily predictable, but they are."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And there you go."}, {"time": 759, "text": "What about, let me play devil's advocate and philosophically speaking, is it possible to say that what defines humans is the outlier."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So even though many, some large percentage of our behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it's the special moments of when we break out of the routine is the definitive thing that we're breaking out of the routine is the definitive things."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And the way we break out of that routine for each one of us might be different."}, {"time": 787, "text": "I would say that I would say it a little differently."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I think I would make two things."}, {"time": 791, "text": "One is a, I'm going to disagree with the premise, I think, but that's fine."}, {"time": 795, "text": "I think the way I would put it is there are people who are very different from lots of other people, but they're not 0%, they're closer to 10%, right?"}, {"time": 802, "text": "So in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people, that'll turn out to be the small number they all behave like each other, even if they individually behave very differently from everyone else."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So I think that's kind of important."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But what you're really asking, I think, and I think this is really a question is, what do you do when you're faced with the situation you've never seen before?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "What do you do when you're faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you've seen others do and you're actually forced to do something and you react to that very differently."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And that is the thing that makes you human."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it's the times when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make where the answer isn't easy, even if you know what the right answer is, that's sort of what defines you as the individual."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And I think what defines people broadly, it's the hard problem."}, {"time": 848, "text": "It's not the easy problem."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's the thing that's going to hurt you."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's not even that it's difficult."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And I do think that that's a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So before we talk about sort of explore the different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence, which we are working on, let me just go along this thread to skip to kind of our world of social media, which is something that at least on the artificial intelligence side you think about."}, {"time": 884, "text": "There's a popular narrative, I don't know if it's true, but that we have these silos in social media and we have these clusterings, as you're kind of mentioning."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And the idea is that, you know, along that narrative is that, you know, we want to, we want to break each other out of those silos so we can be empathetic to other people, to if you're a Democrat, you'd be empathetic to the Republican."}, {"time": 912, "text": "If you're Republican, you're empathetic Democrat."}, {"time": 912, "text": "Those are just two silly bins that we seem to be very excited about, but there's other binnings that we can think about."}, {"time": 917, "text": "Is there, from an artificial intelligence perspective, because you're just saying we cluster along the data, but then interactive artificial intelligence is referring to throwing agents into that mix, AI systems in that mix, helping us interacting with us humans and maybe getting us out of that mix, maybe getting us out of those silos."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Is that something that you think is possible?"}, {"time": 941, "text": "Do you see a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks of people to get us outside of our habits in at least the idea space to where we can sort of be empathetic to other people's lived experiences, other people's points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 971, "text": "Yes, and I actually don't think it's that hard."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Well, it's not hard in this sense."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So imagine that you can, let's just, let's make life simple for a minute."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Let's assume that you can do a kind of partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It doesn't even matter what I mean here, so long as there's some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster, there's some edge between them, right?"}, {"time": 991, "text": "And this is kind of, they don't quite touch even, or maybe they come very close."}, {"time": 995, "text": "If you can imagine that conceptually, then the way you get from here to here is not by going from here to here."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly together, right?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing once we can kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So it's easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships, you know, the edges and sort of the strengths on them and you kind of have some semantic meaning for them, the machine doesn't have to, you do as the designer, then yeah, I think you can kind of move people along and sort of expand them."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "But it's harder than that."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And the reason it's harder than that, or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard, is because I'm gonna tell you a story that someone else told me and I don't, I may get some of the details a little bit wrong, but it's roughly, it roughly goes like this."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You take two sets of people from the same backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "So you separate them up, which we do all the time, right?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Oh, you know, we're gonna break out in the, we're gonna break out groups."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "You're gonna go over there and you're gonna talk about this."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And then you have them sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another, and you have them sort of interact with one another."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "When they come back to talk about what they learn, you want to merge what they've done together."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "It can be extremely hard because they don't, they basically don't speak the same language anymore."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Like when you create these problems and you dive into them, you create your own language."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "So the example this one person gave me, which I found kind of interesting because we were in the middle of that at the time, was they're sitting over there and they're talking about these rooms that you can see, but you're seeing them from different vantage points, depending on what side of the room you're on."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "They can see a clock very easily."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "And so they start referring to the room as the one with the clock."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "This group over here, looking at the same room, they can see the clock, but it's, you know, not in their line of sight or whatever."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So they end up referring to it by some other way."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "When they get back together and they're talking about things, they're referring to the same room and they don't even realize they're referring to the same room."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And in fact, this group doesn't even see that there's a clock there and this group doesn't see whatever's the clock on the wall is the thing that stuck with me."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So if you create these different silos, the problem isn't that the ideologies disagree."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "It's that you're using the same words and they mean radically different things."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "The hard part is just getting them to agree on the, well, maybe we'd say the axioms in our world, right?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "But you know, just get them to agree on some basic definitions because right now they talk, they're talking past each other, just completely talking past each other."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "That's the hard part, getting them to meet, getting them to interact."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "That may not be that difficult."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Getting them to see where their language is leading them to lead past one another."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "That's, that's the hard part."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It's a really interesting question to me."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It could be on the layer of language, but it feels like there's multiple layers to this."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Like it could be worldview."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "It could be, I mean, all boils down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes of the other person to learn the language, to learn like visually how they see the world, to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now with, with trolls, the, the degree of humor in that world."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "For example, I talk about love a lot."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "I'm very like, I'm really lucky to have this amazing community of loving people."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "But whenever I encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because it's so quote unquote cringe."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So, so they, they show love by like derision, I would say."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And I think about on the human level, that's a whole nother discussion."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "That's psychology, that's sociology, so on."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "But I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and to bridge the gap of what is this person's life like?"}, {"time": 1210, "text": "Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the agitations, the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, to even just to think about what was their upbringing like, like having a, a single parent home or a shitty education or all those kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "It feels like that's really important."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "For us to, to, to bring those clusters together, to find that similar language."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But it's unclear how AI can help that because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So the, you know, the word understand, there's doing a lot of work, right?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So do you have to understand it or do you just simply have to note that there is something similar as a point to touch, right?"}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So, you know, you use the word empathy and I like that word, for a lot of reasons, I think you're right in the way that you're using in the ways you're describing, but let's separate it from sympathy, right?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone, empathy is kind of understanding where they're coming from and how they, how they feel, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And for most people, those things go hand in hand."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "For some people, some are very good at empathy and very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Some people cannot experience, well, my observation would be, I'm not a psychologist, my observation would be that some people seem to be very, very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "My observation would be that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy unless they feel empathy first."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "You can understand someone, understand where they're coming from and still think, no, I can't support that, right?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "It doesn't mean that the only way I, because if that, if that isn't the case, then what it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can, to understand someone means you must agree with everything that they do, which isn't right, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "I can feel for someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Well, then we're lost, right?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Because we're not all exactly like each other."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "I have to understand everything that you've gone through."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "It helps clearly, but they're separable ideas, right?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Even though they get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So what I think AI could help you do actually is if, and you know, I'm, I'm being quite fanciful as it were, but if you, if you think of these as kind of, I understand how you interact, the words that you use, the, you know, the actions you take, I have some way of doing this."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Let's not worry about what that is."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "But I can see you as a kind of distribution of experiences and actions taken upon you, things you've done and so on."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And I can do this with someone else and I can find the places where there's some kind of commonality, a mapping as it were, even if it's not total, you know, the, if I think of this as distribution, right, then, you know, I can take the cosine of the angle between you and if it's, you know, if it's zero, you've got nothing in common."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "If it's one, you're
