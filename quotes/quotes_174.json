"text": "It's kind of a question of did the genocide, was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man, or did power create that?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "I mean, it's a great question, and I don't think you can, I don't think you can say that it was always kind of inherent in the man."}, {"time": 374, "text": "I mean, the man without his position and without his power, you know, wouldn't have been able to accomplish what he eventually did in the way of murdering people, you know, and murdering groups of people, which is what genocide is."}, {"time": 388, "text": "So, you know, I don't, it wasn't sort of in him."}, {"time": 392, "text": "I mean, there were, and again, you know, the new research has shown that, you know, he had his childhood was, you know, not a particularly nasty one."}, {"time": 402, "text": "People used to say, you know, the father beat him up, and it turns out, actually, it wasn't the father, it was the mother once in a while."}, {"time": 409, "text": "But basically, you know, he was not an unusual young Georgian kid or student even."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system and him within the Soviet system, I mean, his own development within the Soviet system, I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing that occurred in the 1930s."}, {"time": 435, "text": "You know, he essentially achieved complete power by the early 1930s."}, {"time": 442, "text": "And then as he, as he rolled with it, as you would say, you know, or people would say, you know, it increasingly became murderous."}, {"time": 452, "text": "And there was no, you know, there were no checks and balances, obviously, on that murderous system."}, {"time": 459, "text": "And not only that, you know, people supported it in the NKVD and elsewhere, he learned how to manipulate people."}, {"time": 466, "text": "I mean, he was a superb, you know, political manipulator of those people around him."}, {"time": 474, "text": "And, you know, we have, we've got new transcripts, for example, of, you know, police bureau meetings in the early 1930s."}, {"time": 485, "text": "And you read those things and you read, you know, he uses humor and he uses sarcasm, especially, he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know, to control their behavior and what they do."}, {"time": 500, "text": "And he's a really, you know, he's a real, I guess, manipulator is the right word."}, {"time": 507, "text": "And he does it, he does it with, you know, a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable."}, {"time": 515, "text": "And on the other hand, of course, is terrible because it ends up, you know, creating the system of terror that he creates."}, {"time": 528, "text": "I mean, I guess just to linger on it, I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope in the early 20s, 1920s, did he think he was going to be murdering even a single person, but thousands and millions?"}, {"time": 544, "text": "I just wonder maybe the murder of a single human being just to get them, you know, because you're paranoid about them potentially threatening your power, does that murder then open a door?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "And once you open the door, you become a different human being."}, {"time": 565, "text": "A deeper question here is the soldier Knitsen, you know, the line between good and evil runs in every man, are all of us once we commit one murder in the situation, does that open a door for all of us?"}, {"time": 577, "text": "And I guess even the further deeper questions, how easy it is for human nature to go on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?"}, {"time": 589, "text": "There are a lot of questions in those questions."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And, you know, the slippery slope question I would answer, I suppose by saying, you know, Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin, there were plenty of others, there were a lot of political contingencies that emerged in the 1920s that made it possible for Stalin to seize power."}, {"time": 616, "text": "I don't think of him as, you know, if you would just know him in 1925, I don't think anybody would say much less himself that this was a future mass murderer."}, {"time": 628, "text": "I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him and thought he was, you know, a mindless bureaucrat."}, {"time": 636, "text": "You know, others were less mistrustful of him, but, you know, he managed to gain power in the way he did through this bureaucratic and political maneuvering that was very successful."}, {"time": 649, "text": "You know, the slippery slope, as it were, doesn't really begin until the 1930s, in my view."}, {"time": 713, "text": "And people start seeing that, too, around him."}, {"time": 717, "text": "They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope, it's a dangerous, it's a dangerous situation which is emerging, and some people really understand that."}, {"time": 730, "text": "So I don't, I really do see a differentiation then between the 20s."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I mean, it's true that Stalin, during the Civil War, there's a lot of, you know, good research on that, you know, shows that he already had some of these characteristics of being, as it were, murderous and being, you know, being dictatorial and pushing people around and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 754, "text": "That was all there, but I don't really see that as kind of the necessary stage for the next thing that came, which was the 30s, which was really terror of the worst sort, you know, where everybody's afraid for their lives and most people are afraid for their lives and their family's lives and where torture and that sort of thing becomes a common part, you know, of who, what people had to face."}, {"time": 780, "text": "So it's a different, it's a different world."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And you know, people will argue, they'll argue this kind of Lenin, Stalin continuity debate, you know, that's been going on since I was an undergraduate, right?"}, {"time": 793, "text": "That argument, you know, was Stalin the natural sort of next step from Lenin or was he something completely different?"}, {"time": 803, "text": "Many people will argue, you know, because of Marxism, Leninism, because of the ideology that, you know, it was the natural, it was a kind of natural next step."}, {"time": 813, "text": "You know, I would tend to lean the other way."}, {"time": 816, "text": "Not absolutely."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I mean, I won't make an absolute argument that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin and nothing to do with Marxism, Leninism."}, {"time": 825, "text": "It had a lot to do with it."}, {"time": 827, "text": "But you know, he takes it one major step further."}, {"time": 831, "text": "And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope, you know, metaphor, because that means it's kind of slow and easy."}, {"time": 837, "text": "It's a leap."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And we call, you know, I mean, historians talk about the Stalin revolution, you know, in 28 and 29, you know, that he, in some senses, creates a whole new system, you know, through the five year plan, collectivization and seizing political power the way he does."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Can you talk about the 1930s?"}, {"time": 859, "text": "Can you describe what happened in Holodomor, the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine in the 32 and 33?"}, {"time": 866, "text": "That killed millions of Ukrainians."}, {"time": 868, "text": "It's a long story, you know, but let me try to be as succinct as I can be."}, {"time": 874, "text": "I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33 comes out of, in part, an all union famine that is the result of collectivization."}, {"time": 889, "text": "You know, collectivization was a catastrophe."}, {"time": 892, "text": "You know, the more or less, the so called kulaks, the more or less richer farmers, I mean, they weren't really rich, right?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak, you know, and other people who had nothing were also considered kulaks if they opposed collectivization."}, {"time": 909, "text": "So these kulaks, we're talking millions of them, right?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "And Ukraine, it's worth recalling, and I'm sure you know this, was a, you know, heavily agricultural area, and Ukrainian peasants, you know, were in the countryside and resisted collectivization more than even Russian peasants resisted collectivization, suffered during this collectivization program."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses, they killed their own animals, they were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot, and tens of thousands and others were sent into exile."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So there was a conflagration in the countryside."}, {"time": 953, "text": "And the result of that conflagration in Ukraine was terrible famine."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union, but it was especially bad in Ukraine, in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Now in 3233, a couple of things happen."}, {"time": 972, "text": "I mean, I've argued this in my writing, and, you know, I've also worked on this, I continue to work on it, by the way, with a museum in Kiev that's going to be about the Holodomor."}, {"time": 985, "text": "They're building the museum now, and it's going to be a very impressive set of exhibits, and talk with historians all the time about it."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So what happens in 3233, a couple of things."}, {"time": 997, "text": "First of all, the Stalin develops, develops an even stronger, I say even stronger, because they already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians, an even stronger antipathy for the Ukrainians in general."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "First of all, they resist collectivization."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants out of them, and which he needs."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And so he sends in, then, people to expropriate the grain, and take the grain away from the peasants."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "These teams of people, you know, some policemen, some urban thugs, some party people, some poor peasants, you know, take part too, go into the villages, and forcibly seize grain and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "They're seizing it all over."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I mean, let's remember again, this is all over the Soviet Union, in 32, especially."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33, February of 33, Stalin has convinced the Ukrainian peasantry needs to be shown who's boss, that they're not turning over their grain, that they're resisting the expropriators, that they're hiding the grain, which they do sometimes, right?"}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union, that they're acting like traitors, that they're ready, and he says this, you know, I think it's Kaganovich he says it too, you know, they're ready to kind of pull out of the Soviet Union and join Poland."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know, out to get Ukraine, and so he's gonna then, essentially, break the back of these peasantry."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "And the way he breaks their back is by going through another expropriation program, which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So he's taking away everything they have, everything they have."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "There are new laws introduced, where they will actually punish people, including kids, with death, if they steal any grain, you know, if they take anything from the, you know, from the fields."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So, you know, you can shoot anybody, you know, who is looking for food."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And then he introduces measures in Ukraine, which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "For example, the Ukrainian peasantry are not allowed to leave their villages anymore."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "They can't go to the city to try to find some things."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "I mean, we've got pictures of, you know, Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks in Kharkiv, and in Kiev, and places like that, who've managed to get out of the village and get to the cities, but now they can't leave."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belorussia, or Belarus today, or to Russia, you know, to get any food."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Number of people offer relief, including the Poles, but also the Vatican offers relief."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "He won't allow any relief to Ukraine."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And instead, what happens is that Ukraine turns into, the Ukrainian countryside turns into what my now past colleague who died several years ago, Robert Conquest, called a vast Belsen."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And by that, you know, the image is of bodies just lying everywhere, you know, people dead."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And dying, you know, of hunger, which is, by the way, I mean, as you know, I've spent a lot of time studying genocide, I don't think there's anything worse than dying of hunger from what I have read."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And so, for example, we know there were many cases of cannibalism in the countryside because there wasn't anything to eat."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "People were eating their own kids, right?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "And Stalin knew about this."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And again, you know, we started with this question a little bit earlier, he doesn't, there's not a sign of remorse, not a sign of pity, right?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Not a sign of any kind of human emotion that normal people would have."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?"}, {"time": 1268, "text": "I don't think there's joy."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "I'm not sure Stalin really understood emotion, what joy was, you know."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "I think he felt it was necessary to get those SOBs, right?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "That they deserved it."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "He says that several times, this is their own fault, right?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "This is their own fault."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And as their own fault, you know, they get what they deserve, basically."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "How much was the calculation?"}, {"time": 1297, "text": "How much was it reason versus emotion?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "In terms of, you said he was competent."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "Was there a long term strategy or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "I mean, usually the right answer in history is something like that."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "A little of both?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "No, you can't, you can't."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "It wasn't just, I mean, first of all, you know, the Soviets had it in for Ukraine and Ukrainian nationalism, which they really didn't like."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And by the way, Russians still don't like it, right?"}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "They feared Ukrainian nationalism."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know, we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "You know, so there's a kind of long term determination, as I said, you know, to kind of break the back of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism as any kind of separatist force whatsoever."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "And so there's that rational calculation."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed and peeved and angry on one level with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization and for being difficult and for not conforming, you know, to the way he thinks peasants should act in this situation."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "So you have both things."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "He's also very angry at the Ukrainian party and eventually purges it for not being able to control Ukraine and not be able to control the situation."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "You know, Ukraine is in theory the bread basket, right?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Of Europe."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Well, how come the bread basket isn't turning over to me all this grain so I can sell it abroad and, you know, build new factories and support the workers in the cities?"}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So there's a kind of annoyance."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "You know, when things fail, and this is absolutely typical of Stalin, when things fail, he blames it on other people and usually groups of people, right?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Not individuals, but groups again."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So a little bit of both I think is the right answer."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "This blame, it feels like there's a playbook that dictators follow."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "I just wonder if it comes naturally or just kind of evolves."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Because, you know, blaming others and then telling these narratives and then creating the other and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "It feels like there's too many commonalities for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy that works for dictatorships."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "I mean, it's a very good point."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And I think it's one, you know, that has its merits."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "In other words, I think you're right that there's certain kinds of strategies by dictators that, you know, are common to them."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "A lot of them do killing, not all of them of that sort that Stalin did."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "I've written about Mao and Pol Pot, you know, and Hitler."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "And, you know, there is a sort of, as you say, a kind of playbook for political dictatorship."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way of functioning, you know?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "And that way of functioning was described already by Hannah Arendt early on when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "And she more or less writes the playbook and Stalin does follow it."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent, you know, and how deep does this go and how often does it go in that direction?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "I mean, you can argue, for example, I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "But he did not engage in mass murder."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator who grew up, you know, in the communist movement, went to Moscow, you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "You know, he was a horrible dictator."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "I'm sure he was responsible for a lot of death and destruction."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "But he wasn't a mass murderer."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And so you get those, you know."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree, that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "You know, that he didn't kill the same way, you know, that Stalin killed."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Or people after him, they're communist dictators too, after all, Khrushchev, you know, was a communist dictator."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "But he stopped this killing."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag and people sent off into a gulag and imprisonment and torture and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "But it's not at all the same thing."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao, like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible, horrible atrocities, extensively engaging, in my view, in genocide."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "And there are some who don't."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "And, you know, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality, partly in historical circumstance, you know, partly in who is it that controls the reins of power."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "How much do you connect the ideas of communism or Marxism or socialism to Holodomor, to Stalin's rule?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So how naturally, as you kind of alluded to, does it lead to genocide?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "That's also, I mean, in some ways, I've just addressed that question by saying it doesn't always lead to genocide."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "You know, in the case, again, you know, Cuba is not pretty, but it didn't have, there was no genocide in Cuba."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "And same thing in North Vietnam."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is, is a terrible dictatorship, right?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "And people's rights are totally destroyed, right?"}, {"time": 1657, "text": "They have no freedom whatsoever."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "You know, it's not, as far as we know, genocidal."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "Who knows whether it could be or whether if they took over South Korea, you know, mass murder wouldn't take place and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "But my point is, is that the ideology doesn't necessarily dictate genocide."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "In other words, it's an ideology, I think, that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible given, you know, the way it thinks through history as being, you know, you're on the right side of history and some people are on the wrong side of history and you have to destroy those people who are on the wrong side of history."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "I mean, there is something in, you know, Marxism, Leninism, which, you know, has that kind of language and that kind of thinking."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "But I don't think it's necessarily that way."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley named Martin Malia who has written, you know, wrote a number of books on this subject and he was very, very, he was convinced that the ideology itself, you know, played a crucial role in the murderousness of the Soviet regime."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "I'm not completely convinced."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You know, when I say not completely convinced, I think you could argue it different ways."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "I mean, there's something about the ideology of communism that allows you to decrease the value of human life."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Almost like this philosophy, if it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "So maybe that, if you can reason like that, then it's easier to take the leap of, for the good of the country, for the good of the people, for the good of the world, it's okay to kill a few people."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "And then that's where, I wonder about the slippery slope."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "Yeah, no, no, again, you know, I don't think it's a slippery slope."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "I think it's, I think it's dangerous."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "In other words, I think it's dangerous, but I don't consider, you know, I don't like Marxism, Leninism any better than the next guy."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And I've lived in plenty of those systems to know how they can beat people down and how they can, you know, destroy human aspirations and human interaction between people."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "But they're not necessarily murderous systems."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "They are systems that contain people's autonomy, that force people into work and labor and lifestyles that they don't want to live."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "I spent a lot of time, you know, with East Germans and Poles, you know, who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union, you know, in the post Stalin period, where people lived lives they didn't want to live, you know, and didn't have the freedom to choose."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And that was terrifying in and of itself, but these were not murderous systems."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "And they, you know, ascribed to Marxism, Leninism."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "So I suppose it's important to draw the line between mass murder and genocide and mass murder versus just mass violation of human rights."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "And the leap to mass murder, you're saying, maybe easier in some ideologies than others, but it's not clear that somehow one ideology definitely leads to mass murder and not."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "I wonder how many factors, what factors, how much of it is a single charismatic leader?"}, {"time": 1884, "text": "How much of it is the conflagration of multiple historical events?"}, {"time": 1890, "text": "How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?"}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment in history, predict, looking at the factors, whether something bad's going to happen here?"}, {"time": 1909, "text": "When you look at Iraq at when Saddam Hussein first took power, well, you could, or you can, you know, go even farther back in history, would you be able to predict?"}, {"time": 1920, "text": "So you said, you already kind of answered that with Stalin saying there's no way you could have predicted that in the early 20s."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Is that
