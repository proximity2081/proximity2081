idea of truly understanding something, right?"}, {"time": 385, "text": "You know, I mean, can I truly understand Fermat's last theorem?"}, {"time": 389, "text": "You know, it's easy to state it, but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly large numbers, right?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "I think yes, I think I do understand it, but like if you want to just push people on well, but your intuition doesn't go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think I understand the theorem."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of fields pervading space time, whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever, the Higgs field."}, {"time": 423, "text": "Of course, one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory."}, {"time": 432, "text": "So our intuitions aren't perfect, but I think it's also okay to say that our intuitions get trained, right?"}, {"time": 438, "text": "Like, you know, I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby."}, {"time": 442, "text": "That's not, an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are."}, {"time": 446, "text": "We can train it a little bit."}, {"time": 447, "text": "So that's where I'm going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our cognitive abilities are sort of evolved through time, and so they're biologically constrained."}, {"time": 460, "text": "And so there's a clear limit, as he puts it, to our cognitive abilities, and it's a very harsh limit."}, {"time": 467, "text": "But you actually kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here, is we can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand some of these tricky concepts."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted, hardcoded into our biology that we can't overcome?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize, okay?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "But when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about, you know, 100 dimensional mathematical spaces, he's not visualizing it."}, {"time": 502, "text": "He's doing the math."}, {"time": 503, "text": "That doesn't stop him from understanding the result."}, {"time": 507, "text": "I think, and I would love to understand this better, but my rough feeling, which is not very educated, is that, you know, there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine, right?"}, {"time": 521, "text": "One has the ability to contain in one's brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate them."}, {"time": 529, "text": "And that's a leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven't made."}, {"time": 535, "text": "And once you get there, I'm not sure that there are any limits to our ability to understand the scientific world at all."}, {"time": 542, "text": "Maybe there are."}, {"time": 543, "text": "There's certainly limits in our ability to calculate things, right?"}, {"time": 547, "text": "You know, people are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their head."}, {"time": 551, "text": "But that's not an element of understanding."}, {"time": 554, "text": "It's certainly not a limit in principle."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So of course, as a human, you would say there doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding."}, {"time": 561, "text": "But sort of, have you thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears to us?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "And we just will never be able to, like, it's outside of our, okay."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind of experimental simulation devices we can put together, is there limits to that?"}, {"time": 590, "text": "Is it possible there's limits to that?"}, {"time": 592, "text": "Well, of course it's possible that there are limits to that."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a harder question."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Look, imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers, right?"}, {"time": 607, "text": "Like are we approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world?"}, {"time": 612, "text": "And by definition, there are questions about the natural world that are most interesting to us that are the ones we don't quite yet understand, right?"}, {"time": 619, "text": "So there's always, we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And I don't know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn't even know about classical mechanics, much less quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 628, "text": "So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could do, right?"}, {"time": 633, "text": "They could do enormously better than they were doing at the time."}, {"time": 636, "text": "I see no reason why the same thing isn't true for us today."}, {"time": 639, "text": "So of all the worries that keep me awake at night, the human mind's inability to rationally comprehend the world is low on the list."}, {"time": 649, "text": "So one interesting philosophical point that quantum mechanics bring up is the, that you talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it."}, {"time": 662, "text": "So staying at the human level for a second, how big is the gap between what our perception system allows us to see and the world as it is outside our mind's eye sort of, sort of not at the quantum mechanical level, but as just our, these particular tools we have, which is the few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses."}, {"time": 686, "text": "Well, that last phrase, having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot, right?"}, {"time": 691, "text": "I mean, there is our sort of intuitive understanding of the world."}, {"time": 696, "text": "You don't need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees, right?"}, {"time": 702, "text": "That's something that we figure out pretty quickly."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Project permanence, things like that, the three dimensionality of space, even if we don't have the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it's true."}, {"time": 712, "text": "On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms, right?"}, {"time": 716, "text": "Or molecules or cells for that matter, forget about quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 720, "text": "So but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells using the combination of our senses and our cognitive capacities."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount and I don't think it is a hard and fast boundary."}, {"time": 739, "text": "You know, if you believe in cells, if you believe that we understand those, then there's no reason you believe we can't believe in quantum mechanics just as well."}, {"time": 749, "text": "What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics?"}, {"time": 756, "text": "Conservation of momentum."}, {"time": 758, "text": "Can you elaborate?"}, {"time": 760, "text": "So if you were Aristotle, when Aristotle wrote his book on physics, he made the following very obvious point."}, {"time": 765, "text": "We're on video here, right?"}, {"time": 766, "text": "So people can see this."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So if I push the bottle, let me cover this bottle so we do not have a mess, but okay."}, {"time": 771, "text": "So I push the bottle, it moves, and if I stop pushing, it stops moving."}, {"time": 776, "text": "And this kind of thing is repeated a large number of times all over the place."}, {"time": 780, "text": "If you don't keep pushing things, they stop moving."}, {"time": 783, "text": "This is an indisputably true fact about our everyday environment, okay?"}, {"time": 789, "text": "And for Aristotle, this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things had natures and teleologies, and they had places they wanted to be, and when you were pushing them, you were moving them away from where they wanted to be, and they would return and stuff like that."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And it took a thousand years or 1500 years for people to say, actually, if it weren't for things like dissipation and air resistance and friction and so forth, the natural thing is for things to move forever in a straight line, there's a constant velocity, right?"}, {"time": 824, "text": "And the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea in physics is because it shifts us from a view of natures and teleology to a view of patterns in the world."}, {"time": 838, "text": "So when you were Aristotle, you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening, what's the purpose of it, what's the cause, etc., because, you know, it's nature does or does not want to do that, whereas once you believe in conservation of momentum, things just happen."}, {"time": 853, "text": "They just follow the pattern."}, {"time": 855, "text": "You give me, you have Laplace's demon, ultimately, right?"}, {"time": 857, "text": "You give me the state of the world today, I can predict what it's going to do in the future, I can predict where it was in the past."}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's impersonal, and it's also instantaneous."}, {"time": 866, "text": "It's not directed toward any future goals, it's just doing what it does given the current state of the universe."}, {"time": 872, "text": "I think even more than either classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, that is the profound deep insight that gets modern science off the ground."}, {"time": 880, "text": "You don't need natures and purposes and goals, you just need some patterns."}, {"time": 885, "text": "So it's the first moment in our understanding of the way the universe works where you branch from the intuitive physical space to kind of the space of ideas."}, {"time": 897, "text": "And also the other point you said, which is, conveniently, most of the interesting ideas are acting in the moment."}, {"time": 905, "text": "You don't need to know the history of time or the future."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And of course, this took a long time to get there, right?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "I mean, the conservation of momentum itself took hundreds of years."}, {"time": 916, "text": "It's weird, because like, someone would say something interesting, and then the next interesting thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later, right?"}, {"time": 922, "text": "They weren't even talking to each other, they were reading each other's books."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And probably the first person to directly say that in outer space, in the vacuum, a projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna, Ibn Sina in the Persian Golden Age, circa 1000."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And he didn't like the idea."}, {"time": 939, "text": "He used that, just like Schrodinger used Schrodinger's cat to say, surely you don't believe that, right?"}, {"time": 945, "text": "Ibn Sina was saying, surely you don't believe there really is a vacuum, because if there was a really vacuum, things could keep moving forever, right?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "But still, he got right the idea that there was this conservation of something impetus or mile, he would call it."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And that's 500 years, 600 years before classical mechanics and Isaac Newton."}, {"time": 963, "text": "So Galileo played a big role in this, but he didn't exactly get it right."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And so it just takes a long time for this to sink in, because it is so against our everyday experience."}, {"time": 973, "text": "Do you think it was a big leap, a brave or a difficult leap of sort of math and science to be able to say that momentum is conserved?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "You know, I think it's an example of human reason in action."}, {"time": 991, "text": "You know, even Aristotle knew that his theory had issues, because you could fire an arrow and it would go a long way before it stopped."}, {"time": 998, "text": "So if his theory was things just automatically stop, what's going on?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And he had this elaborate story."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "I don't know if you've heard the story, but the arrow would push the air in front of it away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and push it again."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And anyone reading this is going like, really, that's what you thought?"}, {"time": 1016, "text": "But it was that kind of thought experiment that ultimately got people to say like, actually, no, if it weren't for the air molecules at all, the arrow would just go on by itself."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And it's always this give and take between thought and experience, back and forth, right?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Theory and experiment, we would say today."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Another big question that I think comes up, certainly with quantum mechanics, is what's the difference between math and physics to you?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "To me, you know, very, very roughly, math is about the logical structure of all possible worlds and physics is about our actual world."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about interpretations of quantum mechanics, or no?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "I'm certainly using the word world in the broadest sense, all of reality."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "So I think that reality is specific."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "I don't think that there's every possible thing going on in reality."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "I think that there are rules, whether it's the Schrodinger equation or whatever."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So I think that there's a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live in one of them."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "The world that we're talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum mechanics, might be much bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it's still one physically contiguous world in some sense."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "But so if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics tries to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond the limit of our current understanding."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "What do you make of that process of sort of using math to, so you start maybe with intuition or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition or, but this kind of reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Well, I think I would put it a little bit differently."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "I think we have theories, theories of the physical world, which we then extrapolate and ask, you know, what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where we've actually tested them?"}, {"time": 1143, "text": "It is separately true that math is really, really useful when we construct physical theories and you know, famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of mathematics and physics."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "I think that's a little bit wrong because anything that could happen, any other theory of physics that wasn't the real world, but some other world, you could always describe it mathematically."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "It's just that it might be a mess."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "The surprising thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that you can write it down on a t shirt, right?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I mean, that's what is amazing."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "That's an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So that's an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we could hope to explain or just take as a brute fact."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "But once you have that, you know, there's this indelible relationship between math and physics, but philosophically I do want to separate them."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "What we extrapolate, we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong math, you know, that doesn't apply to our world, right?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "We extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our world."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Again, an unanswerable question."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "Why do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I mean, like I just hinted at, I don't know if there's an answer to that question."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "There could be."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What would an answer look like?"}, {"time": 1226, "text": "Well, an answer could look like if you showed that there was something about our world that maximizes something."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "You know, the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or, you know, maybe we're just generic."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Maybe in the set of all possible worlds, this is what the world would look like, right?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "Like I don't really know."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "I tend to think not."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "I tend to think that there is something specific and rock bottom about the facts of our world that don't have further explanation."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Like the fact of the world exists at all."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And furthermore, the specific laws of physics that we have."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "I think that in some sense, we're just going to, at some level, we're going to say, and that's how it is."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "And, you know, we can't explain anything more."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "I don't know how, if we're anywhere close to that right now, but that seems plausible to me."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And speaking of rock bottom, one of the things sort of your book kind of reminded me or revealed to me is that what's fundamental and what's emergent, it just feels like I don't even know anymore what's fundamental in physics, if there's anything."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "It feels like everything, especially with quantum mechanics, is revealing to us is that most interesting things that I would, as a limited human would think are fundamental can actually be explained as emergent from the more deeper laws."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "I mean, we don't know, of course."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "You had to get that on the table."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "We don't know what is fundamental."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "We do have reasons to say that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?"}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Atoms and molecules are more fundamental than cells and organs."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "Quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "We don't know if that ever bottoms out."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "I do think that there's sensible ways to think about this."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "If you describe something like this table as a table, it has a height and a width and it's made of a certain material and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "That's a very useful description as far as it goes."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "There's a whole other description of this table in terms of a whole collection of atoms strung together in certain ways."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "The language of the atoms is more comprehensive than the language of the table."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces, still talk about it as atoms, but you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?"}, {"time": 1363, "text": "So I think that this comprehensiveness, the domain of validity of a theory gets broader and broader as the theory gets more and more fundamental."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So what do you think Newton would say?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Maybe right in the book review, if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics, something deeply hidden."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "It would take a long time for him to think that any of this was making any sense."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "You catch him up pretty quick in the beginning."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "You give him a shout out in the beginning."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "He is the man."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "I'm happy to say that Newton was the greatest scientist who ever lived."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "He invented calculus in his spare time, which would have made him the greatest mathematician just all by himself, all by that one thing."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "But of course, it's funny because Newton was in some sense still a pre modern thinker."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Rocky Kolb, who is a cosmologist at the University of Chicago said that Galileo, even though he came before Newton, was a more modern thinker than Newton was."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "If you got Galileo and brought him to the present day, it would take him six months to catch up and then he'd be in your office telling you why your most recent paper was wrong."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Whereas Newton just thought in this kind of more mystical way."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "He wrote a lot more about the Bible and alchemy than he ever did about physics, but he was also more brilliant than anybody else and way more mathematically astute than Galileo."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "So I really don't know."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "He might have, he might just, yeah, say like, give me the textbooks, leave me alone for a few months and then be caught up."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "But he might have had mental blocks against seeing the world in this way."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "I really don't know."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Is there any other scientists or philosophers through history that you would like to know their opinion of your book?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "I mean, Einstein is the obvious one, right?"}, {"time": 1478, "text": "We all, I mean, he was not that long ago, but I even speculated at the end of my book about what his opinion would be."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "I am curious as to, you know, what about older philosophers like Hume or Kant, right?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "Like what would they have thought?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Or Aristotle, you know, what would they have thought about modern physics?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Because they do in philosophy, your predilections end up playing a much bigger role in your ultimate conclusions because you're not as tied down by what the data is in physics."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "You know, physics is lucky because we can't stray too far off the reservation as long as we're trying to explain the world that we actually see in our telescopes and microscopes."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "But it's just not fair to play that game because the people we're thinking about didn't know a whole bunch of things that we know, right?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Like we lived through a lot that they didn't live through."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "So by the time we got them caught up, they'd be different people."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "So let me ask a bunch of basic questions."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "I think it would be interesting, useful for people who are not familiar, but even for people who are extremely well familiar."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Let's start with what is quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being in the early part of the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics, and it replaced classical mechanics in a weird way that we're still coming to terms with."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "So in classical mechanics, you have an object, it has a location, it has a velocity, and if you know the location and velocity of everything in the world, you can say what everything's going to do."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Quantum mechanics has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "There's something called the quantum state or the wave function."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And there's an equation governing what the quantum state does."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So it's very much like classical mechanics."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "The wave function is different."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It's sort of a wave."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "It's a vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position and a velocity, but okay, that's a detail."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "The equation is the Schrodinger equation, not Newton's laws, but okay, again, a detail."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there's a whole other set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that there's a quantum state and it evolves in time."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "And all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at the system, when you observe it, when you measure it."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "In classical mechanics, there were no rules about observing."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "You just look at it and you see what's going on."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "That was it, right?"}, {"time": 1621, "text": "In quantum mechanics, the way we teach it, there's something profoundly fundamental about the act of measurement or observation, and the system dramatically changes its state."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "Even though it has a wave function, like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle, it's sort of spread out in a cloud, when you look at it, you don't see that cloud."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "When you look at it, it looks like a particle with a location."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "So it dramatically changes its state right away, and the effects of that change can be instantly seen in what the electron does next."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So again, we need to be careful because we don't agree on what quantum mechanics says."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "That's why I need to say like in the textbook view, et cetera, right?"}, {"time": 1661, "text": "But in the textbook view, quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics, gives a fundamental role to the act of measurement."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "So maybe even more basic, what is an atom and what is an electron?"}, {"time": 1677, "text": "This all came together in a few years around the turn of the last century, right?"}, {"time": 1681, "text": "Around the year 1900."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Atoms predated then, of course, the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks, but it was the chemists in the 1800s that really first got experimental

a chemical element, right?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever, but we know that atoms can be broken up further than that."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "That's what physicists discovered in the early 1900s, Rutherford, especially, and his colleagues."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "So the atom that we think about now, the cartoon, is that picture you've always seen of

only one wave function, and that wave function gives you the probability of observing both electrons at once doing something, okay?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So maybe the electron can be here or here, here, here, and the other electron can also be there."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "But we have a wave function set up where we don't know where either electron is going to be seen."}, {"time":

happens."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "They're truly separate."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "I don't know, it feels like, if you think of a wave function like as a dance floor, it seems like entanglement is

field."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "It's just, what does nothing look like?"}, {"time": 2102, "text": "Just like right here, this location in space, there's a gravitational field, which I can detect by dropping something."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "I don't see it, but there it is."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "So we got a little bit of an idea of entanglement."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Now, what is

state of the system."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "How many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing?"}, {"time": 2205, "text": "So in classical mechanics, I give you the location of something by giving you three numbers, right?"}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Up, down, left, X, Y, Z coordinates."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical state, which means both its position and also its velocity."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "The velocity also has three components."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "So its state lives in something

need to give."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And each one of those numbers corresponds to a dimension in that space."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "So in terms of the amount of information, what is

specific meeting."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "This is the reason why it is hard."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "Entropy means different things even to different physicists."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "But one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know about the state of a system."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "So if I have a bottle of water molecules, and I know that, OK, there's a certain number of water molecules."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "I could weigh it and figure out."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and pressure and things like that."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So there's a certain amount of information I know, a

difference between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical system, is it infinite or finite but very large?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Yeah, we don't know."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "That depends on the system."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "You know, it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "So let's go back a little bit."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived for different systems that will be different sizes."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "They could be infinite or finite."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So that's the number of numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially give me about the system."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "So the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of

a finite entropy."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "We have different arguments on different sides."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "So if it's infinite, how do you think about infinity?"}, {"time": 2375, "text":

called the total number of all numbers."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It's infinite."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "But it is hard to wrap your brain around that, and I think that gives people pause because

right?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "That's a little bit different than what we're used to."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "But are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually is that infinity could be part of that world?"}, {"time": 2428, "text": "Are you comfortable that a world in some dimension, in some aspect?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "I'm comfortable with lots of things."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "I mean, you know, I don't want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "You know, I'm pretty open minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "Yeah, but infinity is a tricky one."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "It's not almost a question of comfort."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It's a question of, is it an overreach of our intuition?"}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Sort of, it could be a convenient, almost like when you add a constant to an equation just because it'll help, it just feels like it's useful to at least be able to imagine a concept, not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels like it's a description of the real world."}, {"time": 2474,

have 300 things, you might as well have infinity things, right?"}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Otherwise, you have to say when to stop making the things, right?"}, {"time": 2500, "text": "So there's a sense in which infinity is a very natural number of things to exist."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "I was never comfortable with infinity because it's just such a, it was too good to be true."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "Because in math, it just helps make things work out."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "When things get very large, close to infinity, things seem to work out nicely."}, {"time": 2522, "text":

for some of them, the answer is infinitely long."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "It's not because you tried to get there."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "You wrote a five line computer program, it doesn't halt."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "So coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics, this idea that I don't think we talked about, can you, this one of the most interesting philosophical points, we talked at the human level, but at the physics level, that at least the textbook definition of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and what is real."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "One, how does that make you feel?"}, {"time": 2593, "text": "And two, what does it then mean to observe something and why is it different than what is real?"}, {"time": 2600, "text": "Yeah, you know, my personal feeling, such as it is, is that things like measurement and observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the ultimate laws of physics."}, {"time": 2613, "text":

the fact that in the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, this idea of measurement or looking at things seems to play an important role?"}, {"time": 2647, "text": "Well, you come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics and there are several alternatives."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "My favorite is the many worlds interpretation, which says two things."}, {"time": 2657,

two, when you think you're measuring something or observing something, what's really happening is you're becoming entangled with that thing."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "So when you think there's a wave

{"time": 2922, "text": "So there's literally a horizon around us and that horizon approaches some fixed distance away from us."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "And you can then argue that within that

the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the 10 to the 122."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "So that's just crazy big."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "If that story is right, that in our observable horizon, there's only a finite dimensional Hilbert space, then this idea of branching of the wave function of the universe into multiple distinct separate branches has to reach a limit at some time."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Once you branch that many times, you've run out of room in Hilbert space."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And roughly speaking, that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptying out and cooling off and entering a phase where it's just empty space, literally forever."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "What's the difference between splitting and copying, do you think?"}, {"time": 2998, "text": "In terms of, a lot of this is an interpretation that helps us sort of model the world."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So perhaps shouldn't be thought of as like, you know, philosophically or metaphysically."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "But in even at the physics level, do you see a difference between generating new copies of the world or splitting?"}, {"time": 3026,

someone told you the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable worry about where all the energy for that came from."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So a pre existing universe splitting into two skinnier universes is a better way of thinking about it."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "And mathematically, it's just like, you know, if you draw an x and y axis, and you draw a vector of length one, 45

conserved."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "All of the effort goes into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into plain English, right?"}, {"time": 3131, "text": "So this idea that there's a universe that has that that the universe comes equipped with a thickness, and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces, but the total amount of universe is is conserved over time, is a reasonably good way of putting English words to the underlying mathematics."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "So one of my favorite things about many worlds is, I mean, I love that there's something

obvious, like, okay, here is a bottle and has a center of mass and things like that."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "Sometimes it's a little bit harder with general relativity, curvature of space time is a little bit harder to grasp."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "quantum mechanics is very hard to map what you're the language you're talking in a wave functions and things like that on to reality."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the underlying formalism to reality."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "So that's where the lack of simplicity comes in, not in the theory, but in how we use the theory to map on to reality."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "In fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating many worlds quantum mechanics is in the this effort to map it on to the world that we see."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "So it's perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right?"}, {"time": 3248, "text": "To say like, well, no, that's just too far away from my experience, I am therefore intrinsically skeptical of it."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "Of course, you should give up on that skepticism if there are no alternatives."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "And this theory always keeps working, then eventually you should overcome your skepticism."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "But right now there are alternatives that are that, you know, people work to make alternatives that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "Can you describe the alternatives?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "I don't think we touched on it, sort of the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "Maybe there's a difference between the Everettian many worlds and many worlds as it is now, like has the idea sort of developed and so on."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And just in general, what is the space of promising contenders?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "We have democratic debates now, there's a bunch of candidates."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "12 candidates on stage."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "What are the quantum mechanical candidates on stage for the debate?"}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical contenders, there'd be no problem getting 12 people up there on stage, but there would still be only three front runners."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "And right now the front runners would be Everett, hidden variable theories are another one."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real, but there's something in addition to the wave function."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "The wave function is not everything, it's part of reality, but it's not everything."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "What else is there?"}, {"time": 3330, "text": "We're not sure, but in the simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "So many worlds says that quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle like in another because they really, really are waves, but under certain observational circumstances they look like particles."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Whereas hidden

relativistic Newtonian particles moving around."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "They get pushed around by the wave function roughly."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So in the conventional textbook

are also induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses automatically."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "So those are basically in my mind, the three big alternatives, many worlds, which is just there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation, hidden variables."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "There's a wave function that always obeys the Schrodinger equation, but there are also new variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation and sometimes it collapses."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many worlds is, but they are closer to our experience."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So just this moment of collapse, do you think of it as a wave function, fundamentally sort of a probabilistic description of the world and this collapse sort of reducing that part of the world into something deterministic, where again, you can now describe the position and the velocity in this simple classical model?"}, {"time": 3476,

Is that how you think about collapse?"}, {"time": 3478, "text": "There is a fourth category, there's a fourth contender, there's a mayor Pete of quantum mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "And what they say is all the wave function is, is a way of making predictions for experimental outcomes."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "It's not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "And in fact, two different people might have two different wave functions for the same physical system because they know different things about it, right?"}, {"time": 3505, "text": "The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay, but it's predicting about what, like what is the thing that is being predicted?"}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And they say, no, no, no, that's not what we're here for."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "We're just here to tell you what the observational outcomes are going to be."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "But the other, the other interpretations kind of think that the wave function is real."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "So that's an ontic interpretation of the wave function, ontology being the study of what is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wave function, epistemology being the study of what we know."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "That would actually just love to see that debate on stage."}, {"time": 3546, "text":

elaborate, why do you find many worlds so compelling?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Well, there's two reasons actually."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?"}, {"time": 3585, "text": "It's like the most bare bones, austere, pure version of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "And I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto reality."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "But the other big reason is that there's something called modern physics with quantum fields and quantum gravity and holography and space time doing things like that."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring along classical baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege some version of classical reality like locations in space, okay?"}, {"time": 3626, "text": "And I think that that's a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything and understanding quantum gravity and the emergence of space time."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here's a harmonic oscillator, oh, there's a spin, here's an electromagnetic field, in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse theories."}, {"time": 3644,

we have with gravity and space time, where the classical description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the most quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space time, the emergence of space time."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So I thought space time was fundamental."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and everybody has of, you know, the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics, a model of space time model of gravity?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "You know, we've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general relativity in the final form."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So gravity is the curvature of space time and there's a field that pervades all the universe that tells us how curved space time is."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "And that's a fundamentally classical."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "That's totally classical."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "But we also have a formalism, an algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "And it could be tricky."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "I mean, you think you're quantizing something, so that means taking a classical theory and promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "But you can run into problems."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So they ran into problems and they did that with electromagnetism, namely that certain quantities were infinity and you don't like infinity, right?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "So Feynman and Tominaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal with the infinities."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't have been worried about those infinities after all."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "But still, that was the, it's always the thought that that's how you will make a good quantum theory."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "You'll start with a classical theory and quantize it."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it or we can try to, but we run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into with electromagnetism."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And so far, those problems are insurmountable."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "We've not been able to get a successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity, by starting with classical general relativity and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And there's evidence that, there's a good reason why this is true, that whatever the quantum theory of gravity is, it's not a field theory."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "It's something that has weird nonlocal features built into it somehow that we don't understand."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "We get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "So if that's true, if the fundamental theory isn't even local in the sense that an ordinary quantum field theory would be, then we just don't know where to start in terms of getting a classical precursor and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "So the only sensible thing, or at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards, see if we can find a classical limit."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "So the idea of locality, the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence, I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "Stuff that's close by interacts, stuff that's far away doesn't."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "So what's locality and why is it not fundamental?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "And how is that even possible?"}, {"time": 3857, "text": "I mean, locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in the beginning of our conversation, right?"}, {"time": 3862, "text": "I mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is?"}, {"time": 3867, "text": "And the answer as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there's a field in between."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And the way a field works is that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends directly on what's happening at points right next to it."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "But what's happening at those points depends on what's happening right next to those, right?"},

happens here is only affected by what's happening right next to it."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "That's locality."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "The idea of locality is built into every field theory, including general relativity as a classical theory."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "It seems to break down when we talk about black holes and, you know, Hawking taught us in the 1970s that black holes radiate, they give off, they eventually evaporate away."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "They're not completely black once we take quantum mechanics into account."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "And we think, we don't know for sure, but most of us think that if you make a black hole out of certain stuff, then like Laplace's demon taught us, you should be able to predict what that black hole will turn into if it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "And if that's true, there are good arguments that can't happen while preserving locality at the same time."}, {"time": 3938,

holography is this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a region of space inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And there's this weird feature of black holes that, again, it's totally a thought experiment feature because we haven't gone and probed any yet."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as seen by an observer who's falling in, which is actually pretty normal."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "Like everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity and you die."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "But from the point of view of the outside observer, it seems like all the information that fell in is actually smeared over the horizon in a nonlocal way."},

more subtly when we quantize gravity."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "And because you can describe everything that's going on in the three dimensional space by looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality doesn't, it's not necessary."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "It's not really what's going on."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "How are we supposed to feel about that?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "We're supposed to feel liberated."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "You know, space is just a good approximation and this was always going to be true once you started quantizing gravity."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "So we're just beginning now to face up to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Is there other weird stuff that happens to quantum mechanics in black hole?"}, {"time": 4063, "text": "I don't think that anything weird has happened with quantum

quantum mechanics, but our ordinary notions of space time don't really quite work."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "And there's a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called complementarity,

answer is nothing special is happening."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "It's still just the Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And that's a different answer than would be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse theories or whatever."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "So the entire point of many worlds is to explain what we observe, but it tries to explain what we already have observed, right?"}, {"time": 4184, "text": "It's not trying to be different from what we've observed because that would be something other than quantum mechanics."}, {"time":
