[{"title": "Andrew Huberman: Neuroscience of Optimal Performance | Lex Fridman Podcast #139", "id": "Ktj050DxG7Q", "quotes": [{"time": 359, "text": "And if people want to challenge me on this, I like to point to that movie, Free Solo, which was wild because it's an incredible movie, but I think a lot of its popularity can be explained by a puzzle, which is you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater or you watched it at home."}, {"time": 382, "text": "You knew before that he survived."}, {"time": 382, "text": "And yet it was still scary that people somehow were able to put themselves into that experience or into Alex's experience enough that they were concerned or worried or afraid at some level."}, {"time": 395, "text": "So heights always does it."}, {"time": 395, "text": "If we get people who have generalized anxiety, these are people who wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of autonomic arousal and anxiety, then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that don't necessarily get everyone afraid."}, {"time": 411, "text": "Things like claustrophobia, public speaking, that's going to vary from person to person."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And then if you're afraid of sharks, like my sister for instance is afraid of sharks, she won't even come to my laboratory because there's a thing about sharks in it."}, {"time": 428, "text": "That's how terrified some people are of these specific stimuli, but heights gets them every time."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And I'm terrified of heights."}, {"time": 434, "text": "We have you step off a platform, virtual platform, and it's a flat floor in my lab, but you're up there."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Well, you actually allow them the possibility in the virtual world to actually take the leap of faith."}, {"time": 448, "text": "Maybe I should describe a little bit of the experiment."}, {"time": 452, "text": "So without giving away too much, in case someone wants to be a subject in one of these experiments, we have them playing a cognitive game."}, {"time": 456, "text": "It's a simple lights out kind of game where you're pointing a cursor and turning out lights on a grid, but it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And there's a failure point for everybody where they just can't make the motor commands fast enough."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And then we surprise people essentially by placing them virtually, all of a sudden they're on a narrow platform between two buildings."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And then we encourage them or we cue them by talking to them through a microphone to continue across that platform to continue the game."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And some people, they actually will get down on the ground and hold onto a virtual beam that doesn't even exist on a flat floor."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if they were real."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And we really think that anchoring the visual and the vestibular, the balance components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly."}, {"time": 520, "text": "There's also the potential, and we haven't done this yet to bring in 360 sound."}, {"time": 524, "text": "So the reason we did 360 video is when we started all this back in 2016, a lot of the VR was pretty lame, frankly, it was CGI, it just wasn't real enough."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But with 360 video, we knew that we could get people into this presence where they think they're in a real experience more quickly."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And our friend Michael Muller, who I was introduced to because of the project, I reached out to some friends."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Michael Muller is a very famous portrait photographer in Hollywood, but he dives with great white sharks and he leaves the cage."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And so we worked with him to build a 360 video apparatus that we could swim underwater with, went out to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, and actually got the experience."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It was a lot of fun."}, {"time": 559, "text": "There's some interesting moments out there of danger, but it came back with that video and built that for the sharks."}, {"time": 570, "text": "And then we realized we need to do this for everything."}, {"time": 570, "text": "We need to do it for heights."}, {"time": 570, "text": "We need to do it for public speaking, for claustrophobia."}, {"time": 573, "text": "And what's missing still is 360 sound where 360 sound would be, for instance, if I were to turn around and there was a giant attack dog there, the moment I would turn around and see it, the dog would growl."}, {"time": 587, "text": "But if I turn back toward you, then it would be silent."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And that brings a very real element to one's own behavior where you don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Whereas if there's a dog growling behind me and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it's still growling, that might seem like more of an impending threat and sustained threat, but actually it's when you start linking your own body movements to the experience."}, {"time": 615, "text": "So when it's closed loop where my movements and choices are starting to influence things and they're getting scarier and scarier, that's when you can really drive people's nervous system down these paths of high states of stress and fear."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Now we don't want to traumatize people obviously, but we also study a number of tools that allow them to calm themselves in these environments."}, {"time": 636, "text": "So the short answer is height."}, {"time": 636, "text": "Well, from a psychology and from a neuroscience perspective, this whole construction that you've developed is fascinating."}, {"time": 643, "text": "We did this a little bit with autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 649, "text": "So to try to understand the decision making process of a pedestrian when they cross the road and trying to create an experience of a car, you know, that could run you over."}, {"time": 662, "text": "So there's the danger there."}, {"time": 662, "text": "I was so surprised how real that whole world was."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And the graphics that we built wasn't ultra realistic or anything, but I was still afraid of being hit by a car."}, {"time": 677, "text": "Everybody we tested were really afraid of being hit by that car."}, {"time": 681, "text": "Even though it was all a simulation."}, {"time": 683, "text": "It was all a simulation."}, {"time": 683, "text": "It was kind of boxy actually."}, {"time": 683, "text": "I mean, it wasn't like ultra realistic simulation."}, {"time": 689, "text": "It was fascinating."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Looms and heights."}, {"time": 689, "text": "So any kind of depth, we're just programmed to not necessarily recoil, but to be cautious about that edge and that depth."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And then looms, things coming at us that are getting larger."}, {"time": 703, "text": "There are looming sensing neurons even in the retina at a very, very early stage of visual processing."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And incidentally, the way Muller and folks learn how to not get eaten by great white sharks when you're swimming outside the cage is as they start lumbering in, you swim toward them."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And they get very confused when you loom on them because clearly you're smaller."}, {"time": 726, "text": "Clearly they could eat you if they wanted to, but there's something about forward movement toward any creature that that creature questions whether or not it would be a good idea to generate forward movement toward you."}, {"time": 736, "text": "And so that's actually the survival tool of these cage exit white shark divers."}, {"time": 742, "text": "Are you playing around with, like one of the critical things for the autonomous vehicle research is you couldn't do 360 video because there's a game theoretic."}, {"time": 752, "text": "There's an interactive element that's really necessary."}, {"time": 757, "text": "So maybe people realize this, maybe they don't, but 360 video, you obviously, well, it's actually not that obvious to people, but you can't change the reality that you're watching."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So, but you find that that's like, is there something fundamental about fear and stress that the interactive element is essential for, or do you find you can, you can arouse people with just the video?"}, {"time": 782, "text": "It works best to use mixed reality."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So we have a snake stimulus that I personally don't like snakes at all."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I don't mind spiders."}, {"time": 793, "text": "We also have a spider stimulus, but like snakes, I just don't like them."}, {"time": 793, "text": "There's something about the, the slithering and the, it just creates a visceral response for me."}, {"time": 803, "text": "Some people not so much, and they have lower levels of stress and fear in there."}, {"time": 803, "text": "But one way that we can get them to feel more of that is to use mixed reality where we have an actual physical bat and they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just walk to a little safe corner, which then makes the snake disappear."}, {"time": 822, "text": "That tends to be not as stressful as if they have a physical weapon."}, {"time": 826, "text": "And so you've got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against this thing."}, {"time": 830, "text": "And there's something about engaging that makes it more of a, more of a threat."}, {"time": 830, "text": "Now, I should also mention that we, we always get the subjective report from the subject of what they experienced because we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling, but that's the beauty of working with humans is you can ask them how they feel and humans aren't great at explaining how they feel."}, {"time": 851, "text": "But it's a lot easier to understand what they're saying than a mouse or a macaque monkey is saying."}, {"time": 856, "text": "So it's the best we can do is language plus these physiological and neurophysiological signals."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Is there something you've learned about yourself about your deepest fears?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "Like you said, snakes, is there something that, like if I were to torture you, I'm, so I'm Russian."}, {"time": 874, "text": "So, you know, I always kind of think, how can I murder this people that this person entered the room, but also how, how can I torture you to get some information out of you?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "What would I go with?"}, {"time": 886, "text": "You should say that I never considered myself claustrophobic, but because I don't mind small environments provided they're well ventilated."}, {"time": 891, "text": "But I, before COVID, I started going to this Russian banya, you know, and then, and I had never been to a banya."}, {"time": 904, "text": "So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna and what are they called?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "The plots."}, {"time": 909, "text": "They're hitting you with the leaves and it gets really hot and humid in there."}, {"time": 914, "text": "And there were a couple of times where I thought, okay, this thing is below ground."}, {"time": 920, "text": "It's in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Like if this place crumbled and we were stuck in here and I'd start getting a little panicky and I realized, I'm like, I don't like small confined spaces with poor ventilation."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So I realized I think I have some claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of that before."}, {"time": 935, "text": "So I've put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus, which involves getting into an elevator and with a bunch of people, virtual people, and the elevator gets stalled."}, {"time": 946, "text": "And at first you're fine."}, {"time": 946, "text": "You feel fine."}, {"time": 946, "text": "But then as we start modulating the environment and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment, if we want to, it is really uncomfortable for me."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And I never would have thought, you know, I fly, I'm comfortable in planes, but it is really uncomfortable."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And so I think I've unhatched a bit of a claustrophobia."}, {"time": 969, "text": "For me as well, probably that one, that one is pretty bad."}, {"time": 975, "text": "The heights I tried to overcome."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So I went to skydiving to try to overcome the fear of heights, but that didn't help."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Did you jump out?"}, {"time": 981, "text": "I jumped out, but it was, it was a, it was fundamentally different experience."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And I guess there could be a lot of different flavors of fear of heights maybe, but the one I have didn't seem to be connected to jumping out of a plane is a very different, cause like once you accept that you're going to jump, then it's, it's a different thing."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "I think what I'm afraid of is the moments before it is the scariest part."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And I don't think that's emphasized in the skydiving experience as much, and also just the acceptance of the fact that it's going to happen."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "So once you accept that it's going to happen, it's not as scary."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "It's the fact that it's not supposed to happen."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "And it might, that's the scary part that I guess I'm not being eloquent in this description, but there's something about skydiving that was actually philosophically liberating."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "I was, I was like, wow, it, it was the possibility that you can walk on a surface."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "And then at a certain point there's no surface anymore to walk on."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "And it's all of a sudden the world becomes three dimensional and there's this freedom of floating that the concept of like of earth disappears for a brief few seconds."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "That was, that was wild."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "That was wild, but I'm still terrified of heights."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So, I mean, one, one thing I want to ask just on fear, cause it's so fascinating is have you learned anything about what it takes to overcome fears?"}, {"time": 1080, "text": "And that comes from two, from a, you know, research study standpoint, two parallel tracks of research."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "One was done actually in mice, because we have a mouse lab also where we can probe around in different brain areas and try and figure out what interesting brain areas we might want to probe around in humans."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And a graduate student in my lab, she's now at Caltech, Lindsay Saleh, published a paper back in 2018, showing that what at first might seem a little bit obvious, but the mechanisms are not, which is that there are really three responses to fear."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "You can pause, you can freeze essentially."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "You can retreat, you can back up, or you can go forward."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And there's a single hub of neurons in the midbrain, it's actually not the midbrain, but it's in the middle of the thalamus, which is a forebrain structure."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "And depending on which neurons are active there, there's a much higher probability that a mouse, or it turns out, or a human will advance in the face of fear or will pause or will retreat."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "Now that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "But what's interesting is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal is actually associated with the pausing and freezing response."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Then as the threat becomes more impending, and we used visual looms in this case, the retreat response has a slightly higher level of autonomic arousal and stress."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So think about playing hide and go seeking, you're trying to stay quiet in a closet that you're hiding."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "If you're very calm, it's easy to stay quiet and still."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "As your level of stress goes up, it's harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "You see this also in animals that are stalking, a cat will chatter its teeth."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "That's actually sort of top down inhibition and trying to restrain behavior."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So the freeze response is actually an active response, but it's fairly low stress."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And what was interesting to us is that the highest level of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward the threat."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So in your case, jumping out of the plane."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "However, the forward movement in the face of threat was linked to the activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side connection, literally a wire in the brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so when one safely and adaptively, meaning you survive, moves through a threat or toward a threat, it's rewarded as a positive experience."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And so the key, it actually maps very well to cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot of the existing treatments for trauma is that you have to confront the thing that makes you afraid."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So otherwise you exist in this very low level of reverberatory circuit activity where the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they're humming more and more and more."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And we have to remember that stress and fear and threat were designed to agitate us so that we actually move."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So the reason I mentioned this is I think a lot of times people think that the maximum stress response or fear response is to freeze and to lock up."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "But that's actually not the maximum stress response."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "The maximum stress response is to advance, but it's associated with reward."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "It has positive valence."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So there's this kind of, everyone always thinks about the bell shape, you know, the sort of hump shape curve for, you know, at low levels arousal performance is low and as the increases performance goes higher and then it drops off as you get really stressed."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "But there's another bump further out that distribution where you perform very well under very high levels of stress."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And so we've been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place and also to let them experience how there are heightened states of cognition there."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "There's changes in time perception that allow you to evaluate your environment at a faster frame rate, essentially."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "This is the matrix as a lot of people think of it."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "But we tend to think about fear as all the low level stuff where things aren't worked out, but there are a lot of different features to the fear response."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "And so we think about it quantitatively and we think about it from a circuit perspective in terms of outcomes."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "And we try and weigh that against the threat."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So we never want people to put themselves in unnecessary risk, but that's where the VR is fun because you can push people hard without risk of physically injuring them."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And that's like you said, the little bump that seems to be a very small fraction of the human experience, right?"}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So it's kind of fascinating to study it because most of us move through life without ever experiencing that kind of focus."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Well, everything's in a peak state there."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "I really think that's where optimal performance lies."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "There's so many interesting words here, but what's performance?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And what's optimal performance?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "We're talking about mental ability to what to perceive the environment quickly to make actions quickly."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "What's optimal performance?"}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Well, it's very subjective and it varies depending on task and environment."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "So one way we can make it a little bit more operational and concrete is to say there is a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of internal autonomic arousal, AKA stress or alertness, whatever you want to call it, is ideally matched to the speed of whatever challenge you have to be facing in the outside world."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "So we all have perception of the outside world as exteroception and the perception of our internal real estate interoception."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And when those two things, when interoception and exteroception are matched along a couple of dimensions, performance tends to increase or tends to be in an optimal range."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So for instance, if you're, I don't play guitar, but I know you play guitar."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So let's say you're trying to learn something new on the guitar."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "I'm not saying that being in these super high states of activation are the best place for you to be in order to learn."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It may be that your internal arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched to the information coming in and what you're trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of playing chords and notes and so forth."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Now, in these cases of high threat where things are coming in quickly and animals and humans need to react very quickly, the higher your state of autonomic arousal, the better because you're slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic system works."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "The pupil dilation, for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your optics and that's obvious."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "But with the change in optics is a change in how you bin time and slice time, which allows you to get more frames per second readout."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "With the guitar learning, for instance, it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy, almost in a drowsy state to be able to, and I don't play music, so I'm guessing here, but sense some of the nuance in the chords or the ways to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So matching the movement of your fingers to something that's pure exteroception."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And so there is no perfect autonomic state for performance."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "This is why I don't favor terms like flow because they're not well operationally defined enough."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "But I do believe that optimal or peak performance is going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to the space time features of the external demands."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So there's some slicing of time that happens and then you're able to adjust, slice time more finely or more, less finely in order to adjust to the stimulus, the dynamics of the stimulus."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "What about the realm of ideas?"}, {"time": 1561, "text": "So like, you know, I'm a big believer, this guy named Cal Newport who wrote a book about deep work."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Yeah, I love that book."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Yeah, he's great."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "I mean, one of the nice things, I've always practiced deep work, but it's always nice to have words put to the concepts that you've practiced."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It somehow makes them more concrete and allows you to get better."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "It turns it into a skill that you can get better at."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "But, you know, I also value deep thinking where you think it's almost meditative."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "You think about a particular concept for long periods of time."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "The programming you have to do that kind of thing for."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "You just have to hold this concept, like you hold it and then you take steps with it."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "You take further steps and you're holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you're thinking about them."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And there's a lot of, I mean, the hardest part is there's frustrating things like you take a step and it turns out to be the wrong direction."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So you have to calmly turn around and take a step back."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And then it's, you kind of like exploring through the space of ideas."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Is there something about your study of optimal performance that can be applied to the act of thinking as opposed to action?"}, {"time": 1646, "text": "Well, we haven't done too much work there, but I think I can comment on it from a neuroscience perspective, which is really all I do is, well, I mean, we do experiments in the lab, but I'm looking at things through the lens of neuroscience."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So what you're describing can be mapped fairly well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change in information is coming back into your brain."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Jack Feldman, who I'm a huge fan of and fortunate to be friends with is a professor at UCLA, works on respiration and breathing, but he has a physics background."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of ground states and how they modulate other states."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Very, very interesting and I think important work."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Jack has an answer to your question."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So I'm not going to get this exactly right because this is lifted from a coffee conversation that we had about a month ago."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So apologies in advance, but I think I can get mostly right."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So we were talking about this, about how the brain updates cognitive states depending on demands and thinking in particular."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And he used an interesting example."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "I'd be curious to know if you agree or disagree."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "He said, most great mathematics is done by people in their late teens and 20s, and even you could say early 20s, sometimes into the late 20s, but not much further on."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "Maybe I just insulted some mathematicians."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "No, that's true."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "And I think that it demands, his argument was there's a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number of plates spinning, so to speak mentally and run back and forth between them, updating them."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "In physics, Jack said, and I think this makes sense to me too, that there's a reliance on working memory, but an increased reliance on some deep memory and deep memory stores, probably stuff that's moved out of the hippocampus and forebrain and into the cortex and is some episodic and declarative stuff, but really, so you're pulling from your library, basically."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "It's not all RAM, it's not all working memory."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And then in biology,

means that the space time relationship for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid space time relationship, right?"}, {"time": 2352, "text": "If I slow it down, it's slower,

it's random and that neuron stops firing because it's just kind of dots moving everywhere."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And there's a systematic map so that other neurons are responding and things

it."}, {"time": 7482, "text": "So when you take on a challenge, provided that you understand the core mechanics of how to run pushups and pullups and whatever else you decided to do, once you set the

that."}, {"time": 7929, "text": "So there's a paper published in Cell, super top tier journal, two years ago, looking at effort."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And this was in a visual environment of
