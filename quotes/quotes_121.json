solver like that."}, {"time": 650, "text": "However, it's not practical because the overhead, the constant overhead is so large that for the small kinds of problems that we want to solve in this little biosphere."}, {"time": 664, "text": "By the way, when you say small, you're talking about things that fall within the constraints of our computational systems."}, {"time": 670, "text": "So they can seem quite large to us mere humans, right?"}, {"time": 674, "text": "That's right, yeah."}, {"time": 675, "text": "So they seem large and even unsolvable in a practical sense today, but they are still small compared to almost all problems because almost all problems are large problems, which are much larger than any constant."}, {"time": 691, "text": "Do you find it useful as a person who has dreamed of creating a general learning system, has worked on creating one, has done a lot of interesting ideas there, to think about P versus NP, this formalization of how hard problems are, how they scale, this kind of worst case analysis type of thinking, do you find that useful?"}, {"time": 716, "text": "Or is it only just a mathematical, it's a set of mathematical techniques to give you intuition about what's good and bad."}, {"time": 725, "text": "So P versus NP, that's super interesting from a theoretical point of view."}, {"time": 731, "text": "And in fact, as you are thinking about that problem, you can also get inspiration for better practical problem solvers."}, {"time": 741, "text": "On the other hand, we have to admit that at the moment, the best practical problem solvers for all kinds of problems that we are now solving through what is called AI at the moment, they are not of the kind that is inspired by these questions."}, {"time": 758, "text": "There we are using general purpose computers such as recurrent neural networks, but we have a search technique which is just local search gradient descent to try to find a program that is running on these recurrent networks, such that it can solve some interesting problems such as speech recognition or machine translation and something like that."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And there is very little theory behind the best solutions that we have at the moment that can do that."}, {"time": 790, "text": "Do you think that needs to change?"}, {"time": 792, "text": "Do you think that will change?"}, {"time": 794, "text": "Or can we go, can we create a general intelligent systems without ever really proving that that system is intelligent in some kind of mathematical way, solving machine translation perfectly or something like that, within some kind of syntactic definition of a language, or can we just be super impressed by the thing working extremely well and that's sufficient?"}, {"time": 815, "text": "There's an old saying, and I don't know who brought it up first, which says, there's nothing more practical than a good theory."}, {"time": 823, "text": "And a good theory of problem solving under limited resources, like here in this universe or on this little planet, has to take into account these limited resources."}, {"time": 841, "text": "And so probably there is locking a theory, which is related to what we already have, these asymptotically optimal problem solvers, which tells us what we need in addition to that to come up with a practically optimal problem solver."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So I believe we will have something like that."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And maybe just a few little tiny twists are necessary to change what we already have, to come up with that as well."}, {"time": 876, "text": "As long as we don't have that, we admit that we are taking suboptimal ways and recurrent neural networks and long short term memory for equipped with local search techniques."}, {"time": 890, "text": "And we are happy that it works better than any competing methods, but that doesn't mean that we think we are done."}, {"time": 900, "text": "You've said that an AGI system will ultimately be a simple one."}, {"time": 905, "text": "A general intelligence system will ultimately be a simple one."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Maybe a pseudocode of a few lines will be able to describe it."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Can you talk through your intuition behind this idea, why you feel that at its core, intelligence is a simple algorithm?"}, {"time": 926, "text": "Experience tells us that the stuff that works best is really simple."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So the asymptotically optimal ways of solving problems, if you look at them, they're just a few lines of code, it's really true."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Although they are these amazing properties, just a few lines of code."}, {"time": 945, "text": "Then the most promising and most useful practical things, maybe don't have this proof of optimality associated with them."}, {"time": 957, "text": "However, they are also just a few lines of code."}, {"time": 960, "text": "The most successful recurrent neural networks, you can write them down in five lines of pseudocode."}, {"time": 968, "text": "That's a beautiful, almost poetic idea, but what you're describing there is the lines of pseudocode are sitting on top of layers and layers of abstractions in a sense."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So you're saying at the very top, it'll be a beautifully written sort of algorithm."}, {"time": 991, "text": "But do you think that there's many layers of abstractions we have to first learn to construct?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "Yeah, of course, we are building on all these great abstractions that people have invented over the millennia, such as matrix multiplications and real numbers and basic arithmetics and calculus and derivations of error functions and derivatives of error functions and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So without that language that greatly simplifies our way of thinking about these problems, we couldn't do anything."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So in that sense, as always, we are standing on the shoulders of the giants who in the past simplified the problem of problem solving so much that now we have a chance to do the final step."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So the final step will be a simple one."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "If we take a step back through all of human civilization and just the universe in general, how do you think about evolution and what if creating a universe is required to achieve this final step?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "What if going through the very painful and inefficient process of evolution is needed to come up with this set of abstractions that ultimately lead to intelligence?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Do you think there's a shortcut or do you think we have to create something like our universe in order to create something like human level intelligence?"}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So far, the only example we have is this one, this universe in which we are living."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Do you think we can do better?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Maybe not, but we are part of this whole process."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So apparently, so it might be the case that the code that runs the universe is really, really simple."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "Everything points to that possibility because gravity and other basic forces are really simple laws that can be easily described also in just a few lines of code basically."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And then there are these other events that the apparently random events in the history of the universe, which as far as we know at the moment don't have a compact code, but who knows?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Maybe somebody in the near future is going to figure out the pseudo random generator which is computing whether the measurement of that spin up or down thing here is going to be positive or negative."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Underlying quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Do you ultimately think quantum mechanics is a pseudo random number generator?"}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So it's all deterministic."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "There's no randomness in our universe."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Does God play dice?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So a couple of years ago, a famous physicist, quantum physicist, Anton Zeilinger, he wrote an essay in nature and it started more or less like that."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "One of the fundamental insights of the 20th century was that the universe is fundamentally random on the quantum level."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And that whenever you measure spin up or down or something like that, a new bit of information enters the history of the universe."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And while I was reading that, I was already typing the response and they had to publish it."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Because I was right, that there is no evidence, no physical evidence for that."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "So there's an alternative explanation where everything that we consider random is actually pseudo random, such as the decimal expansion of pi, 3.141 and so on, which looks random, but isn't."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "So pi is interesting because every three digits sequence, every sequence of three digits appears roughly one in a thousand times."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And every five digit sequence appears roughly one in 10,000 times, what you would expect if it was random."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "But there's a very short algorithm, a short program that computes all of that."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So it's extremely compressible."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And who knows, maybe tomorrow, somebody, some grad student at CERN goes back over all these data points, better decay and whatever, and figures out, oh, it's the second billion digits of pi or something like that."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "We don't have any fundamental reason at the moment to believe that this is truly random and not just a deterministic video game."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "If it was a deterministic video game, it would be much more beautiful."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Because beauty is simplicity."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And many of the basic laws of the universe, like gravity and the other basic forces are very simple."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So very short programs can explain what these are doing."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And it would be awful and ugly."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "The universe would be ugly."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "The history of the universe would be ugly if for the extra things, the random, the seemingly random data points that we get all the time, that we really need a huge number of extra bits to describe all these extra bits of information."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "So as long as we don't have evidence that there is no short program that computes the entire history of the entire universe, we are, as scientists, compelled to look further for that shortest program."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Your intuition says there exists a program that can backtrack to the creation of the universe."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So it can give the shortest path to the creation of the universe."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Including all the entanglement things and all the spin up and down measures that have been taken place since 13.8 billion years ago."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "So we don't have a proof that it is random."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "We don't have a proof that it is compressible to a short program."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "But as long as we don't have that proof, we are obliged as scientists to keep looking for that simple explanation."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "So you said the simplicity is beautiful or beauty is simple."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Either one works."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "But you also work on curiosity, discovery, the romantic notion of randomness, of serendipity, of being surprised by things that are about you."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "In our poetic notion of reality, we think it's kind of like, poetic notion of reality, we think as humans require randomness."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So you don't find randomness beautiful."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "You find simple determinism beautiful."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Because the explanation becomes shorter."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "A universe that is compressible to a short program is much more elegant and much more beautiful than another one, which needs an almost infinite number of bits to be described."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "As far as we know, many things that are happening in this universe are really simple in terms of short programs that compute gravity and the interaction between elementary particles and so on."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So all of that seems to be very, very simple."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Every electron seems to reuse the same subprogram all the time, as it is interacting with other elementary particles."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "If we now require an extra oracle injecting new bits of information all the time for these extra things which are currently not understood, such as better decay, then the whole description length of the data that we can observe of the history of the universe would become much longer and therefore uglier."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And uglier."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Again, simplicity is elegant and beautiful."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "The history of science is a history of compression progress."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Yes, so you've described sort of as we build up abstractions and you've talked about the idea of compression."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "How do you see this, the history of science, the history of humanity, our civilization, and life on Earth as some kind of path towards greater and greater compression?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "How do you think about that?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Indeed, the history of science is a history of compression progress."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "What does that mean?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Hundreds of years ago there was an astronomer whose name was Kepler and he looked at the data points that he got by watching planets move."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "And then he had all these data points and suddenly it turned out that he can greatly compress the data by predicting it through an ellipse law."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "So it turns out that all these data points are more or less on ellipses around the sun."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And another guy came along whose name was Newton and before him Hooke."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And they said the same thing that is making these planets move like that is what makes the apples fall down."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And it also holds for stones and for all kinds of other objects."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "And suddenly many, many of these observations became much more compressible because as long as you can predict the next thing, given what you have seen so far, you can compress it."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And you don't have to store that data extra."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "This is called predictive coding."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And then there was still something wrong with that theory of the universe and you had deviations from these predictions of the theory."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "And 300 years later another guy came along whose name was Einstein."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "And he was able to explain away all these deviations from the predictions of the old theory through a new theory which was called the general theory of relativity."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "Which at first glance looks a little bit more complicated and you have to warp space and time but you can't phrase it within one single sentence which is no matter how fast you accelerate and how hard you decelerate and no matter what is the gravity in your local network, light speed always looks the same."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And from that you can calculate all the consequences."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "So it's a very simple thing and it allows you to further compress all the observations because certainly there are hardly any deviations any longer that you can measure from the predictions of this new theory."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So all of science is a history of compression progress."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "You never arrive immediately at the shortest explanation of the data but you're making progress."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Whenever you are making progress you have an insight."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You see oh first I needed so many bits of information to describe the data, to describe my falling apples, my video of falling apples, I need so many data, so many pixels have to be stored."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "But then suddenly I realize no there is a very simple way of predicting the third frame in the video from the first two."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "And maybe not every little detail can be predicted but more or less most of these orange blobs that are coming down they accelerate in the same way which means that I can greatly compress the video."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And the amount of compression, progress, that is the depth of the insight that you have at that moment."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "That's the fun that you have, the scientific fun, the fun in that discovery."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And we can build artificial systems that do the same thing."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "They measure the depth of their insights as they are looking at the data which is coming in through their own experiments and we give them a reward, an intrinsic reward in proportion to this depth of insight."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And since they are trying to maximize the rewards they get they are suddenly motivated to come up with new action sequences, with new experiments that have the property that the data that is coming in as a consequence of these experiments has the property that they can learn something about, see a pattern in there which they hadn't seen yet before."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So there is an idea of power play that you described, a training in general problem solver in this kind of way of looking for the unsolved problems."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Can you describe that idea a little further?"}, {"time": 1840, "text": "It's another very simple idea."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So normally what you do in computer science, you have some guy who gives you a problem and then there is a huge search space of potential solution candidates and you somehow try them out and you have more less sophisticated ways of moving around in that search space until you finally found a solution which you consider satisfactory."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "That's what most of computer science is about."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Power play just goes one little step further and says let's not only search for solutions to a given problem but let's search to pairs of problems and their solutions where the system itself has the opportunity to phrase its own problem."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "So we are looking suddenly at pairs of problems and their solutions or modifications of the problem solver that is supposed to generate a solution to that new problem."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "And this additional degree of freedom allows us to build career systems that are like scientists in the sense that they not only try to solve and try to find answers to existing questions, no they are also free to pose their own questions."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So if you want to build an artificial scientist you have to give it that freedom and power play is exactly doing that."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So that's a dimension of freedom that's important to have but how hard do you think that, how multidimensional and difficult the space of then coming up with your own questions is."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So it's one of the things that as human beings we consider to be the thing that makes us special, the intelligence that makes us special is that brilliant insight that can create something totally new."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So now let's look at the extreme case, let's look at the set of all possible problems that you can formally describe which is infinite, which should be the next problem that a scientist or power play is going to solve."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "Well, it should be the easiest problem that goes beyond what you already know."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "So it should be the simplest problem that the current problem solver that you have which can already solve 100 problems that he cannot solve yet by just generalizing."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So it has to be new, so it has to require a modification of the problem solver such that the new problem solver can solve this new thing but the old problem solver cannot do it and in addition to that we have to make sure that the problem solver doesn't forget any of the previous solutions."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And so by definition power play is now trying always to search in this pair of, in the set of pairs of problems and problems over modifications for a combination that minimize the time to achieve these criteria."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So it's always trying to find the problem which is easiest to add to the repertoire."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "So just like grad students and academics and researchers can spend their whole career in a local minima stuck trying to come up with interesting questions but ultimately doing very little."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "Do you think it's easy in this approach of looking for the simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck in a local minima?"}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Is not never really discovering new, you know really jumping outside of the 100 problems that you've already solved in a genuine creative way?"}, {"time": 2087, "text": "No, because that's the nature of power play that it's always trying to break its current generalization abilities by coming up with a new problem which is beyond the current horizon."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Just shifting the horizon of knowledge a little bit out there, breaking the existing rules such that the new thing becomes solvable but wasn't solvable by the old thing."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "So in the paper with the amazing title, Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun and Intrinsic Motivation, you talk about discovery as intrinsic reward, so if you view humans as intelligent agents, what do you think is the purpose and meaning of life for us humans?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "You've talked about this discovery, do you see humans as an instance of power play, agents?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Humans are curious and that means they behave like scientists, not only the official scientists but even the babies behave like scientists and they play around with their toys to figure out how the world works and how it is responding to their actions and that's how they learn about gravity and everything."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "In 1990 we had the first systems like that which would just try to play around with the environment and come up with situations that go beyond what they knew at that time and then get a reward for creating these situations and then becoming more general problem solvers and being able to understand more of the world."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "I think in principle that curiosity strategy or more sophisticated versions of what I just described, they are what we have built in as well because evolution discovered that's a good way of exploring the unknown world and a guy who explores the unknown world has a higher chance of solving the mystery that he needs to survive in this world."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "On the other hand, those guys who were too curious they were weeded out as well so you have to find this trade off."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "Evolution found a certain trade off."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Apparently in our society there is a certain percentage of extremely explorative guys and it doesn't matter if they die because many of the others are more conservative."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "It would be surprising to me if that principle of artificial curiosity wouldn't be present in almost exactly the same form here."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "In our brains."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "You are a bit of a musician and an artist."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Continuing on this topic of creativity, what do you think is the role of creativity and intelligence?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "So you've kind of implied that it's essential for intelligence if you think of intelligence as a problem solving system, as ability to solve problems."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "But do you think it's essential, this idea of creativity?"}, {"time": 2307, "text": "We never have a program, a sub program that is called creativity or something."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "It's just a side effect of what our problem solvers do."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "They are searching a space of problems, a space of candidates, of solution candidates until they hopefully find a solution to a given problem."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "But then there are these two types of creativity and both of them are now present in our machines."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "The first one has been around for a long time, which is human gives problem to machine, machine tries to find a solution to that."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "And this has been happening for many decades and for many decades machines have found creative solutions to interesting problems where humans were not aware of these particularly creative solutions but then appreciated that the machine found that."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "The second is the pure creativity."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "That I would call, what I just mentioned, I would call the applied creativity, like applied art where somebody tells you now make a nice picture of this Pope and you will get money for that."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "So here is the artist and he makes a convincing picture of the Pope and the Pope likes it and gives him the money."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "And then there is the pure creativity which is more like the power play and the artificial curiosity thing where you have the freedom to select your own problem."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Like a scientist who defines his own question to study and so that is the pure creativity if you will as opposed to the applied creativity which serves another."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "And in that distinction there is almost echoes of narrow AI versus general AI."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So this kind of constrained painting of a Pope seems like the approaches of what people are calling narrow AI and pure creativity seems to be, maybe I am just biased as a human but it seems to be an essential element of human level intelligence."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Is that what you are implying?"}, {"time": 2444, "text": "To a degree?"}, {"time": 2446, "text": "If you zoom back a little bit and you just look at a general problem solving machine which is trying to solve arbitrary problems then this machine will figure out in the course of solving problems that it is good to be curious."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "So all of what I said just now about this prewired curiosity and this will to invent new problems that the system doesn't know how to solve yet should be just a byproduct of the general search."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "However, apparently evolution has built it into us because it turned out to be so successful, a prewiring, a bias, a very successful exploratory bias that we are born with."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And you have also said that consciousness in the same kind of way may be a byproduct of problem solving."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "Do you find this an interesting byproduct?"}, {"time": 2505, "text": "Do you think it is a useful byproduct?"}, {"time": 2507, "text": "What are your thoughts on consciousness in general?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Or is it simply a byproduct of greater and greater capabilities of problem solving that is similar to creativity in that sense?"}, {"time": 2521, "text": "We never have a procedure called consciousness in our machines."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "However, we get as side effects of what these machines are doing things that seem to be closely related to what people call consciousness."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "So for example, already in 1990 we had simple systems which were basically recurrent networks and therefore universal computers trying to map incoming data into actions that lead to success."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Maximizing reward in a given environment, always finding the charging station in time whenever the battery is low and negative signals are coming from the battery, always find the charging station in time without bumping against painful obstacles on the way."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "So complicated things but very easily motivated."}, {"time": 2574, "text": "And then we give these little guys a separate recurrent neural network which is just predicting what's happening if I do that and that."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "What will happen as a consequence of these actions that I'm executing."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And it's just trained on the long and long history of interactions with the world."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "So it becomes a predictive model of the world basically."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And therefore also a compressor of the observations of the world because whatever you can predict you don't have to store extra."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "So compression is a side effect of prediction."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "And how does this recurrent network compress?"}, {"time": 2613, "text": "Well, it's inventing little subprograms, little subnetworks that stand for everything that frequently appears in the environment like bottles and microphones and faces, maybe lots of faces in my environment so I'm learning to create something like a prototype face and a new face comes along and all I have to encode are the deviations from the prototype."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "So it's compressing all the time the stuff that frequently appears."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "There's one thing that appears all the time that is present all the time when the agent is interacting with its environment which is the agent itself."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "But just for data compression reasons it is extremely natural for this recurrent network to come up with little subnetworks that stand for the properties of the agents, the hand, the other actuators and all the stuff that you need to better encode the data which is influenced by the actions of the agent."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "So there just as a side effect of data compression during problem solving you have internal self models."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "Now you can use this model of the world to plan your future and that's what we also have done since 1990."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "So the recurrent network which is the controller which is trying to maximize reward can use this model of the network of the world, this model network of the world, this predictive model of the world to plan ahead and say let's not do this action sequence, let's do this action sequence instead because it leads to more predicted reward."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And whenever it is waking up these little subnetworks that stand for itself then it is thinking about itself and it is thinking about itself and it is exploring mentally the consequences of its own actions and now you tell me what is still missing."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Missing the next, the gap to consciousness."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "That's a really beautiful idea that if life is a collection of data and life is a process of compressing that data to act efficiently in that data you yourself appear very often."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "So it's useful to form compressions of yourself and it's a really beautiful formulation of what consciousness is a necessary side effect."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "It's actually quite compelling to me."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "You've described RNNs, developed LSTMs, long short term memory networks that are a type of recurrent neural networks that have gotten a lot of success recently."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So these are networks that model the temporal aspects in the data, temporal patterns in the data and you've called them the deepest of the neural networks."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So what do you think is the value of depth in the models that we use to learn?"}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Since you mentioned the long short term memory and the LSTM I have to mention the names of the brilliant students who made that possible."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "First of all my first student ever Sepp Hochreiter who had fundamental insights already in his diploma thesis."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "Then Felix Geers who had additional important contributions."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Alex Gray is a guy from Scotland who is mostly responsible for this CTC algorithm which is now often used to train the LSTM to do the speech recognition on all the Google Android phones and whatever and Siri and so on."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So these guys without these guys I would be nothing."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "It's a lot of incredible work."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "What is now the depth?"}, {"time": 2850, "text": "What is the importance of depth?"}, {"time": 2852, "text": "Well most problems in the real world are deep in the sense that the current input doesn't tell you all you need to know about the environment."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "So instead you have to have a memory of what happened in the past and often important parts of that memory are dated."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "They are pretty old."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So when you're doing speech recognition for example and somebody says 11 then that's about half a second or something like that which means it's already 50 time steps."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And another guy or the same guy says 7."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "So the ending is the same even but now the system has to see the distinction between 7 and 11 and the only way it can see the difference is it has to store that 50 steps ago there was an S or an L, 11 or 7."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So there you have already a problem of depth 50 because for each time step you have something like a virtual layer in the expanded unrolled version of this recurrent network which is doing the speech recognition."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "So these long time lags they translate into problem depth."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "And most problems in this world are such that you really have to look far back in time to understand what is the problem and to solve it."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "But just like with LSTMs you don't necessarily need to when you look back in time remember every aspect you just need to remember the important aspects."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "The network has to learn to put the important stuff into memory and to ignore the unimportant noise."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "But in that sense deeper and deeper is better or is there a limitation?"}, {"time": 2970, "text": "I mean LSTM is one of the great examples of architectures that do something beyond just deeper and deeper networks."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "There's clever mechanisms for filtering data, for remembering and forgetting."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So do you think that kind of thinking is necessary?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "If you think about LSTMs as a leap, a big leap forward over traditional vanilla RNNs, what do you think is the next leap within this context?"}, {"time": 3002, "text": "So LSTM is a very clever improvement but LSTM still don't have the same kind of ability to see far back in the past as us humans do."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "The credit assignment problem across way back not just 50 time steps or 100 or 1000 but millions and billions."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "It's not clear what are the practical limits of the LSTM when it comes to looking back."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Already in 2006 I think we had examples where it not only looked back tens of thousands of steps but really millions of steps."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "And Juan Perez Ortiz in my lab I think was the first author of a paper where we really, was it 2006 or something, had examples where it learned to look back for more than 10 million steps."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So for most problems of speech recognition it's not necessary to look that far back but there are examples where it does."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Now the looking back thing, that's rather easy because there is only one past but there are many possible futures and so a reinforcement learning system which is trying to maximize its future expected reward and doesn't know yet which of these many possible futures should I select given this one single past is facing problems that the LSTM by itself cannot solve."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "So the LSTM is good for coming up with a compact representation of the history and observations and actions so far but now how do you plan in an efficient and good way among all these, how do you select one of these many possible action sequences that a reinforcement learning system has to consider to maximize reward in this unknown future?"}, {"time": 3126, "text": "We have this basic setup where you have one recurrent network which gets in the video and the speech and whatever and it's executing actions and it's trying to maximize reward so there is no teacher who tells it what to do at which point in time."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "And then there's the other network which is just predicting what's going to happen if I do that and that and that could be an LSTM network and it learns to look back all the way to make better predictions of the next time step."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "So essentially although it's predicting only the next time step it is motivated to learn to put into memory something that happened maybe a million steps ago because it's important to memorize that if you want to predict that at the next time step, the next event."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Now how can a model of the world like that, a predictive model of the world be used by the first guy?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Let's call it the controller and the model, the controller and the model."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "How can the model be used by the controller to efficiently select among these many possible futures?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "The naive way we had about 30 years ago was let's just use the model of the world as a stand in, as a simulation of the world and millisecond by millisecond we plan the future and that means we have to roll it out really in detail and it will work only if the model is really good and it will still be inefficient because we have to look at all these possible futures and there are so many of them."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So instead what we do now since 2015 in our CM systems, controller model systems, we give the controller the opportunity to learn by itself how to use the potentially relevant parts of the M, of the model network to solve new problems more quickly."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "And if it wants to, it can learn to ignore the M and sometimes it's a good idea to ignore the M because it's really bad, it's a bad predictor in this particular situation of life where the controller is currently trying to maximize reward."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "However, it can also learn to address and exploit some of the subprograms that came about in the model network through compressing the data by predicting it."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So it now has an opportunity to reuse that code, the algorithmic information in the model network to reduce its own search space such that it can solve a new problem more quickly than without the model."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "Compression."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So you're ultimately optimistic and excited about the power of RL, of reinforcement learning in the context of real systems."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "So you see RL as a potential having a huge impact beyond just sort of the M part is often developed on supervised learning methods."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "You see RL as a for problems of self driving cars or any kind of applied cyber robotics."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "That's the correct interesting direction for research in your view?"}, {"time": 3334, "text": "I do think so."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "We have a company called Nasence which has applied reinforcement learning to little Audis which learn to park without a teacher."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "The same principles were used of course."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So these little Audis, they are small, maybe like that, so much smaller than the real Audis."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "But they have all the sensors that you find in the real Audis."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "You find the cameras, the LIDAR sensors."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "They go up to 120 kilometers an hour if they want to."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And they have pain sensors basically and they don't want to bump against obstacles and other Audis and so they must learn like little babies to park."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "Take the raw vision input and translate that into actions that lead to successful parking behavior which is a rewarding thing."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "And yes, they learn that."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "So we have examples like that and it's only in the beginning."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "This is just the tip of the iceberg and I believe the next wave of AI is going to be all about that."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "So at the moment, the current wave of AI is about passive pattern observation and prediction and that's what you have on your smartphone and what the major companies on the Pacific Rim are using to sell you ads to do marketing."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "That's the current sort of profit in AI and that's only one or two percent of the world economy."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Which is big enough to make these companies pretty much the most valuable companies in the world."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "But there's a much, much bigger fraction of the economy going to be affected by the next wave which is really about machines that shape the data through their own actions."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Do you think simulation is ultimately the biggest way that those methods will be successful in the next 10, 20 years?"}, {"time": 3456, "text": "We're not talking about 100 years from now."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "We're talking about sort of the near term impact of RL."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Do you think really good simulation is required or is there other techniques like imitation learning, observing other humans operating in the real world?"}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Where do you think the success will come from?"}, {"time": 3477, "text": "So at the moment, we have a tendency of using physics simulations to learn behavior from machines that learn to solve problems that humans also do not know how to solve."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "However, this is not the future because the future is in what little babies do."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "They don't use a physics engine to simulate the world."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "No, they learn a predictive model of the world which maybe sometimes is wrong in many ways but captures all kinds of important abstract high level predictions which are really important to be successful."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And that's what was the future 30 years ago when we started that type of research but it's still the future and now we know much better how to go there to move forward and to really make working systems based on that where you have a learning model of the world, a model of the world that learns to predict what's going to happen if I do that and that."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "And then the controller uses that model to more quickly learn successful action sequences."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And then of course always this curiosity thing."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "In the beginning, the model is stupid so the controller should be motivated to come up with experiments with action sequences that lead to data that improve the model."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "Do you think improving the model, constructing an understanding of the world in this connection is now the popular approaches that have been successful are grounded in ideas of neural networks."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "But in the 80s with expert systems, there's symbolic AI approaches which to us humans are more intuitive in the sense that it makes sense that you build up knowledge in this knowledge representation."}, {"time": 3592, "text":

programming was a huge thing."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "Was it inspiring to you yourself?"}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Did you find it compelling?"}, {"time": 3612, "text": "Because a lot of your work was not so much in that realm, right?"}, {"time": 3617, "text": "It was more in the learning systems."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "Yes and no, but we did all of that."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "So my first publication ever actually was 1987, was the implementation of genetic algorithm of a genetic programming system in Prolog."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "So Prolog, that's what you learn back then

networks existed and were well known back then and deep learning has existed since 1965, since this guy in the Ukraine, Iwakunenko, started it."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "But the Japanese and many other people, they focused really on this logic programming and I was influenced to the extent that I said, okay, let's take these biologically inspired algorithms like evolution, programs, and

proof searcher on board so that's very much logic programming."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "Without that it would not be asymptotically optimal."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "But then on the other hand,

have little to do with theorem proving themselves, then as long as that is not the case, you just want to have better pattern recognition."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "So to build a self driving car,

million copies and sell it."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "And so at the moment this is not possible, but we already see how we are going to get there."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And you can imagine to the extent that this works economically and cheaply, it's going to change everything."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "Almost all of production is going to be affected by that."}, {"time": 3931, "text":
